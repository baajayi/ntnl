Faith, Sexism, and Justice: 
A Call to Action
This social statement was amended and then adopted by a more than two-
thirds vote (863-26) at the fifteenth Churchwide Assembly on August 9, 2019, at 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
This social statement comes in two versions. The short version conveys the 
statement’s essence in 40 articles, containing the entire scope of convictions and 
commitments.* The full version consists of those same 40 articles (in bold), along 
with a preface, a conclusion, and an explanation for each article, allowing readers 
to go deeper into an article’s meaning. These two formats serve different needs. 
Both were crafted in the hope that the Holy Spirit will move readers into fruitful 
understanding, commitment, and action. Several supplemental resources are 
available to aid readers with this statement. All supplemental resources are available 
on the statement’s web page, ELCA.org/socialstatements. Please note that underlined 
words in the text refer to the first appearance of words defined in the glossary.

Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
Short Statement
I. Fundamental Teaching:
God desires abundant life for all.
1) We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America believe 
God’s intention revealed through the Scriptures is that all people 
have life abundantly and flourish.
2) We believe all people are created equally in the image of God. 
Every individual is dependent upon God, and all share in the 
God-given vocation to contribute their gifts to help all of creation 
flourish. Being in the image of the triune God means that we 
humans are relational, that we are interconnected. Just as we 
interact with God, we are social creatures relating with each other 
and all of creation.
3) Despite God’s intention for creation, humans exist in a 
state of sin. Because we fail to trust God as we should, we 
are alienated from God, from other people, and from creation 
itself. Not only individually, but also collectively, we live out this 
alienation through disobedience to God, pride, complacency, 
self-abasement, and acts against others, all of which limit the 
abundant life God intends.
4) We believe that we are healed and redeemed from this 
alienation. That is, Lutherans confess that we are justified by 
God’s grace through faith in Jesus Christ, no matter what we 
have done or left undone. This promise means we are freed from 
bondage to the people and things we trust and love more than 
God or the ways we try to justify ourselves, sometimes at the 
expense of others. God’s grace frees us and empowers us to love 
others as God loves all of creation.
5) Our focus as Lutheran Christians on Jesus Christ affects how 
this church understands the call to do justice. Because we are 
freed in Christ for others, we are able to respond to God’s call to 
A Social Statement 
2
love our neighbor as ourselves. In society, neighbor love takes the 
form of neighbor justice.
6) This focus on Jesus Christ also affects how we understand 
the Scriptures. While the Scriptures speak both Law and Gospel, 
Martin Luther emphasized that the Scriptures should be read 
by paying attention to what proclaims Christ—what carries the 
Gospel message of God’s grace and mercy to all people.
7) As Lutheran Christians, we recognize human reason and 
knowledge as gifts from God to be used for the common good. 
While the scriptural call to neighbor justice is clear, human reason 
and knowledge are essential to discern the specific forms, policies, 
and structures that best enable us to enact justice in particular 
contexts. Recognizing that the gifts of reason and knowledge are 
given to people of all religions and worldviews, Christians are 
freed to work together with them for the common good.
8) We believe that the church is called to live as the body of Christ 
in the world even while we struggle with the realities of sin. As 
Lutherans, we recognize that acting justly within family, church, 
and society for the common good is central to the vocation to 
which God calls all people.
II. Analysis of the Problem: 
Sin subverts human flourishing in many ways.
9) Though God desires fullness of life and equity for everyone, as 
a church we recognize that women and girls in particular suffer 
a range of harm and injustice due to sex (biological), gender, or 
both. In addition to sex and gender, the experiences of individuals 
and groups are shaped and complicated by intersecting factors. 
These include race, ethnicity, national origin, nationality 
(including American Indian and Alaska Native), religious identity, 
immigration status, sexuality, marital status, economic means, 
age, ability, embodied experiences, and education. This reality is 
known as intersectionality.1 This statement’s references to women 
and girls are intended to be inclusive of all people who identify as 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
3
women or girls in the diversity of their individual and communal 
identities and expressions.
10) The experiences of women and girls from a variety of 
backgrounds, both in the past and in the present moment, reveal 
that they have often been restricted in realizing abundant life on 
the basis of sex (biological) or gender.
	
11) The far-reaching harm experienced by women and girls is 
rooted in a pattern of power, privilege, and prejudice, the key 
elements in any social system of oppression. This is the basis 
of the ELCA’s understanding of racism.2 When power, privilege, 
and prejudice are associated with sex, gender, and sexuality, 
sociologists use the terms patriarchy and sexism.3 
Patriarchy is a social system dominated by men, identified 
with men, and centered on men’s actions, voices, and authority. 
Patriarchy does not mean that males are bad and females are 
good, or that only males support this unfair system. However, 
in patriarchal systems, men are typically viewed as superior 
to women, are given more power than women, and have more 
authority than women. A patriarchal worldview and way of 
life grants male privilege. Sexism is the reinforcement of male 
privilege, which leads to discrimination. It promotes the silencing, 
controlling, and devaluing of women, girls, and people whose 
gender expression is different from the conventional expressions 
of masculinity and femininity.
Because people live within social and religious systems, everyone 
knowingly or unknowingly participates in this patriarchal system. 
Although patriarchy and sexism affect different people in different 
ways, as individuals we are socialized to conform to these patterns 
of power, privilege, and prejudice. This makes us complicit in 
maintaining social systems of oppression.
12) Although men and boys often benefit from this social system, 
patriarchal structures and values also harm men and boys, 
including gay and transgender men. They are harmed when they 
are pressured to conform to narrow gender stereotypes or are 
A Social Statement 
4
unable to live out a false ideal of male superiority and control. 
People of all genders who do not conform to gender-based roles 
and stereotypes often are not seen or valued; sometimes they are 
violently oppressed and even killed. Men of all racial and ethnic 
minorities in North America may experience patriarchy and 
sexism particularly intertwined with white privilege. The message 
of white-identified patriarchy and sexism is that men and boys of 
color are not fully men and boys.
	
13) Some social and religious beliefs compound patriarchy. Most 
instances of gender-based harm are connected to commonly held 
beliefs and customs. For example, ideas that people are created 
into a hierarchy based on sex—being only male or female—
reinforce and sometimes lead to gender-based injustice.
14) The ELCA celebrates that humans are relational beings and 
that we live in social systems. Positive, equitable social systems 
can lead to joy and gladness. However, social systems can also 
have negative consequences.
Even though individuals make choices within social systems, those 
systems are more powerful than any individual, government, 
culture, or religious community. Beliefs and customs are reflected 
in laws, policies, and practices within both secular and religious 
institutions, which makes them so systemic that they are difficult 
to identify and dismantle.
This church’s commitment to neighbor justice compels us to expose 
how patriarchy and sexism are woven into individual, social, and 
religious life, causing harm to all people and even to all of creation.
15) As Christians, we see that patriarchy and sexism prevent all 
human beings from living into the abundant life for which God 
created them. Patriarchy and sexism reflect a lack of trust in God 
and result in harm and broken relationships. Just as this church 
has identified racism as sin, this church identifies patriarchy and 
sexism as sin. We confess that, as God’s people forgiven in Jesus 
Christ, we are simultaneously liberated and sinful. We are broken, 
yet we are made new by grace through faith. This good news 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
5
is true even as we participate in cultures and societies that are 
broadly patriarchal and sexist.
III. The Christian Tradition:
It is both challenge and resource.
	
16) In faith, this church confesses that Christianity has been 
complicit in the sin of patriarchy and sexism through certain 
beliefs, practices, and aspects of its history. At the same time, we 
believe God provides resources within the Christian faith and the 
Lutheran tradition to challenge the harmful beliefs and effects of 
patriarchy and sexism and to bring forth new ways of living.
17) The ELCA teaches that God’s Word of Law and Gospel speaks 
through the Scriptures. We also recognize that there are words 
and images, social patterns, and moral beliefs in the Scriptures 
that reflect values rooted in what today we call patriarchy and 
sexism. Some aspects of the Scriptures reflect the cultures and 
societies in which they arose. Their continued misuse contributes 
to maintaining hierarchies and patterns of inequity and harm. A 
Lutheran reading of the Scriptures through Christ, focused on 
the devotional, historical, literary, and theological aspects of texts, 
frees us from the harm of taking all the Scriptures only literally.
	
18) The Christian theological tradition is full of ideas and 
teaching that can negatively or positively affect people. In 
particular, some doctrines affect our understanding of humanity 
and God more than others. Teachings about the cross and 
suffering, the image of God, the incarnation, the body of Christ, 
and the Trinity have sometimes been misused to support 
patriarchal beliefs, attitudes, church practices, behaviors, and 
structures. These teachings affect our use of language and our 
understandings of humanity and Christian ministry. At the same 
time, these doctrines can be liberating resources for healing the 
effects of the sins of patriarchy and sexism.
19) The central Lutheran belief that we are justified by grace 
through faith empowers this church to challenge patriarchy 
A Social Statement 
6
and sexism, which devalue people according to sinful human 
standards.
20) The Lutheran understanding of the sacraments of Baptism 
and Holy Communion, in which the Word of God is connected 
with tangible, physical elements, grounds efforts to prevent the 
harm that sexism and patriarchy cause to the bodies, minds, and 
spirits of human beings.
	
21) The ELCA has identified sufficiency, sustainability, solidarity, 
and participation as the key principles for creating and 
supporting justice.4 This church commends these principles 
to create and support neighbor justice, specifically gender 
justice for the neighbor. Social and religious structures and 
institutions—including ideas, beliefs, religious teachings, laws, 
policies, practices, and language—must be assessed and should 
be guided by these principles.
	
22) The ELCA recognizes that some progress has been made 
to address patriarchy and sexism and to reduce their effects; 
however, more effort is required. We believe that this church, 
together with many other partners, can identify and challenge 
the complexities of patriarchy and sexism and advance equity. 
Gender-based equity happens through beliefs and ideas that 
are gender just and through laws, policies, and practices that 
support an equitable common good—abundant life for all.
	
IV. Response: The ELCA is called to new commitments 
and action as a church.
	
23) Propelled by these theological convictions and the robust 
resources of the Lutheran heritage, this church responds to God’s 
call to justice with the following commitments to promote and 
support action toward a more equitable life together in Christ.
 
24) This church recognizes that the body of Christ is called 
to honor and support women and girls from a variety of 
backgrounds, identities, and personal experiences in ways more 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
7
consistent with life-giving theology and faith practices. As a 
church, we commit ourselves to celebrating and affirming the gifts 
and insights that women and girls bring to every expression and 
dimension of this church.
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America specifically 
commits to:
25) Promote the practice and use of scriptural translation and 
interpretation that acknowledge the contexts in which the 
Scriptures were written and reject the misuse of Scripture that 
has supported sexist attitudes and patriarchal structures.
26) Promote theological reflection that responds to the gender-
based needs of the neighbor. Teachers and theologians need to be 
honest about how church teachings have been misused to support 
patriarchy and sexism. More importantly, this church calls upon 
its teachers and theologians to work toward worthier expressions 
of the historic faith that honor God’s desire for all people to thrive.
	
27) Use inclusive language (all genders) for humankind and inclusive 
and expansive language (other than human) for God. This church 
is committed to the deepest Christian understanding of the Trinity 
revealed through Jesus Christ and to the importance of imagining 
and speaking about God in faithful ways that expand rather 
than limit the expression of God's self-revelation and mystery. In 
particular, we support developing liturgies, hymns, prayers, and 
educational materials that broaden use beyond predominantly 
masculine language. This practice follows the scriptural witness that 
God transcends human categories. Therefore, as in the Scriptures, 
metaphors for and images of God should be drawn frequently from 
the lives of people of all identities and experiences and gleaned 
from nature in all its diversity. Employing inclusive and expansive 
language for and images of God helps human beings approach and 
encounter the God of beauty and love who reveals God’s self to 
humanity in rich and mysterious ways.
	
28) Develop and support more extensive policies and practices 
within the ELCA that promote equitable authority and leadership 
A Social Statement 
8
within this church in all its expressions. In many instances 
this requires promoting the leadership of women, with special 
concern for women of color. In other cases, this means promoting 
the participation of men in more varied roles, including those 
traditionally seen as “women’s work.”
29) Promote changes that are economically just, including 
equitable pay and benefits, for women in all ELCA institutions and 
organizations, with special attention to the situations of people 
affected by intersecting forms of discrimination.
	
30) Seek and encourage faithful dialogue, discernment, and, when 
possible, joint action on issues of patriarchy and sexism with other 
members of the body of Christ and with partners of other religions 
and worldviews. As a member of a global communion, the ELCA 
affirms the Lutheran World Federation’s “Gender Justice Policy.” 
www.lutheranworld.org/content/women-church-and-society.
V. Response: The ELCA calls for action and new  
    commitments in society.
	
31) This church teaches that the God who justifies expects all 
people to seek justice in earthly relationships, structures, and 
systems. The ELCA calls for sustained and renewed efforts 
through which women, girls, and gender non-conforming people 
experience greater equity and justice. The following commitments 
express this church’s firm hope for renewed social relationships 
and structures that benefit the common good.
	
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commits itself to:
	
32) Advocate for and support laws, policies, and practices that 
respect diverse bodies rather than discriminating against, 
objectifying, or devaluing them. Women, girls, and people who 
identify as non-binary must not be deprived of their human 
or civil rights. (See the ELCA’s social message “Human Rights,” 
ELCA.org/socialmessages.)  
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action

33) Advocate for and support the eradication of gender-based 
violence within the church and more broadly in society by 
addressing both the systemic aspects of such violence and the 
personal responsibility of those who perpetrate harm. (See the 
ELCA’s social messages “Gender-based Violence” and “Commercial 
Sexual Exploitation,” ELCA.org/socialmessages.) 
34) Advocate for and support medical research, health care 
delivery, and access to equitable and affordable health care 
services, including reproductive health care, that honor 
how bodies differ and eliminate discrimination due to sex 
(biological), gender, or sexual orientation. (See the ELCA social 
statements “Caring for Health: Our Shared Endeavor” and 
“Abortion,” ELCA.org/socialstatements.) 
	
35) Advocate for and support economic policies, regulations, 
and practices that enhance equity and equality for women and 
girls, with special concern for raising up women and girls who 
experience intersecting forms of oppression. (See the ELCA’s 
social statement “Sufficient, Sustainable Livelihood for All,” 
ELCA.org/socialstatements.) 
	
36) Advocate for and support multifaceted understandings of 
social and economic roles so that neither our human traits (such 
as courage or compassion) nor our callings (such as business 
leader or stay-at-home parent) are dictated by our sex (biological) 
and gender. Encourage and empower all people to use their gifts 
for the sake of the common good, whether at home, at work, or in 
the public sphere.
37) Advocate for and support resources for families of various 
configurations and the communities in which they live. Empower 
parents and all who raise or care for children or other family 
members to nurture, protect, and provide for their households in 
ways that do not reinforce gender-based stereotypes. In particular, 
advocate for institutional changes that support and encourage 
men and boys to participate in all family roles associated with the 
home, caregiving, parenting, and nurturing.
A Social Statement 
10
38) Advocate for and support legal reforms, humane policies, 
and adequate services for migrants, immigrants, refugees, and 
asylum seekers, especially those who experience intersecting 
forms of oppression. (See the ELCA’s social message 
“Immigration,” ELCA.org/socialmessages.) 
39) Advocate for and support portrayals in entertainment, media, 
and advertising that do not objectify or stereotype people but 
rather show all people as capable of the wide variety of human 
characteristics and roles.
40) Advocate for and support means for increasing women’s 
participation in local, state, and national politics, with special 
attention to the proportionate advocacy and support needed by 
those who face intersecting forms of oppression.

A Shared Vision:
We trust God’s promises, and we hope for justice.
	
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) rejoice 
that God is always at work to transform and inspire us to new 
ways of living, ways that more fully embody God’s intention of 
abundant life. However, due to sexism, many are deprived of God’s 
good intention that all flourish. Over time and in many places, 
people have made changes to counter the effects of sexism. Yet we 
accept that we are called to seek even fuller measures of justice 
and equity for all those affected by this sin. We do not presume to 
have quick, perfect, or easy solutions as we work together with all 
people who strive for justice in the world. Yet, grounded in God’s 
promises, we know that Christians have both the freedom and the 
responsibility to serve all neighbors in love.
In the Book of Isaiah, God sends the prophet “to bring good news 
to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim 
liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners; to proclaim 
the year of the LORD’s favor” (Isaiah 61:1b-2a). God promises new 
heavens and a new earth—for all God’s people. God envisions not 
only healing and freedom from bondage, but also gladness, joy, 
and abundant and flourishing life for all people, which we will 
feel even in the bones of our bodies (Isaiah 65-66). Mirroring a 
mother’s care for her child (Isaiah 66:13), God desires harmony 
and integrity for individuals and communities, physically and 
spiritually. God’s promise of new creation is the vision of what will 
come to be and the assurance of God’s faithfulness. What hardly 
seems possible will be possible, for even the wolf and the lamb 
will feed together (Isaiah 65:25).
In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus proclaims at the beginning of his 
ministry that he is the one through whom God acts to bring 
good news to the oppressed and captive, to heal, and to set free. 
Women respond to God’s promise. Mary proclaims God’s favor. 
A Social Statement 
12
An unnamed woman anoints Jesus’ feet. Women—among them, 
Mary and Martha—follow Jesus publicly and use their  means to 
support Jesus’ ministry. A bleeding woman trusts in Jesus’ power 
to heal. Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and 
“the other women” witness the empty tomb and the angels who 
announce the resurrection of Jesus; they spread the word that 
God reaches from the promised future to raise Jesus Christ to 
new life, as the first fruit of the new creation. (See Luke 1:39-56; 
7:36-50; 8:1-3; 8:42b-48; 10:38-42; and 24:1-12; and I Cor. 15:20-23.) 
The incarnate and risen Jesus Christ is the embodiment of the new 
creation God promises.
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America join the 
witness of these women and live in the hope of God’s promise of 
new creation through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus 
Christ. We offer thanksgiving to the holy Trinity, whose love 
intends an abundant life for every person (John 10:10). We live 
in hope, anticipating God’s promise of a just world without the 
oppression of sin and evil. God’s vision in Isaiah is that people live 
in gladness, joy, safety, and harmony until old age—so that “your 
bodies shall flourish like the grass” (Isaiah 66:14).
We believe that the Holy Spirit is 
always at work through God in 
Jesus Christ to transform us, to 
draw us into the promised life of 
the new creation. In this church, 
we confess that we ourselves are 
always being made a new creation 
in Christ through baptism. Who 
we are becoming in Christ by the 
power of the Holy Spirit gives meaning to who we are and how we 
act right now.
Society and the church universal are gifts from God. Nevertheless, 
personal, social, and religious forces often work in opposition to 
God’s desire for abundant and flourishing life for all. This church 
sees and denounces all the ways human sin interferes with 
flourishing. With thanksgiving for God’s gracious promise through 
We believe that the 
Holy Spirit is always at 
work through God in 
Jesus Christ to transform 
us, to draw us into the 
promised life of the 
new creation.

Jesus Christ to break the bonds of sin, this church lives in the 
confidence that we are always being made new to love and serve 
the neighbor.
Love of neighbor is expressed in 
seeking justice for the neighbor. 
This includes gender justice. 
Gender justice is for all people and 
requires particular attention to 
seeking fuller justice for women 
and girls. Because we rely on God 
as a God of promise, this church speaks about sexism and the 
harm it causes for all people. Those who support gender justice 
are intent on righting gender-based wrongs that prevent the 
abundant and flourishing life God intends.
We in this church rejoice in the ways God’s people are already 
being led forth in joy (Isaiah 55:12). We are thankful God gives the 
vision and sustenance to change what seems unchangeable, even 
as we wait for God to wipe away every tear (Isaiah 25:8). Most of 
all, we live in hope because, through Jesus Christ, we trust that 
God’s promises will not fail.
	
I. Fundamental Teaching:
God desires abundant life for all.
1) We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America believe 
God’s intention revealed through the Scriptures is that all 
people have life abundantly and flourish.
	
From creation to redemption in the Christian story, the Scriptures 
reveal God’s intention of abundant and flourishing life for 
creation, including for human beings. On the sixth day of creation, 
“God saw everything that [God] had made, and indeed, it was 
very good” (Genesis 1:31a). Creation stories tell of the goodness, 
flourishing, and majestic diversity that flow from God’s creative 
and sustaining power (e.g., Genesis 1 and 2, Psalms 8 and 104, 
and Job 38). Throughout the stories of the life of God’s people in 
Gender justice is for all 
people and requires 
particular attention to 
seeking fuller justice for 
women and girls.

ancient Israel, God is ever-present, willing them into flourishing 
life and often showing them ways out of situations that seem to 
have no way out.5
The Gospels underscore God’s 
desire for abundant life. Jesus 
Christ, the Word made flesh, 
embodies and proclaims God’s 
desire. In the Gospel of John, Jesus 
declares, “I came that they may have 
life, and have it abundantly” (John 
10:10b). Jesus put this into action 
by eating with everyone, including 
marginalized people (Mark 2:15). 
Jesus lived compassionately, healing and casting out evil spirits 
(Matthew 14:14). Jesus criticized those who neglect justice and 
mercy (Matthew 23:23) and delivered God’s call to respond to the 
needs of anyone who is disadvantaged, marginalized, and unjustly 
treated (Matthew 25:35-40). Jesus Christ embodied God’s urgent 
and persistent desire for the well-being of all people yesterday, 
today, tomorrow, and in the promised, future life.
The Book of Revelation speaks of the healing of the nations and 
closes with a vision of new heavens and earth as the ultimate 
outcome of God’s resolve (Revelation 22:1-2). This church believes 
the triune God intends creation to flourish and is ever at work so 
that all people may thrive.
	
2) We believe all people are created equally in the image of 
God. Every individual is dependent upon God, and all share in 
the God-given vocation to contribute their gifts to help all of 
creation flourish. Being in the image of the triune God means 
that we humans are relational, that we are interconnected. 
Just as we interact with God, we are social creatures relating 
with each other and all of creation.
As the Scriptures witness, all of creation originates from God, 
who sustains creation and will ultimately bring creation to its 
fullness. In Genesis 1, God speaks creation into existence; by a 
Jesus declares, “I 
came that they may 
have life, and have 
it abundantly.”(John 
10:10b)… Jesus 
criticized those who 
neglect justice and 
mercy (Matthew 23:23).

word, humans are created in the 
image of God (imago Dei). “Then 
God said, ‘Let us make ’ādām [the 
Hebrew word for “humankind”] 
in our image, according to our 
likeness’” (Genesis 1:26a).6 Human 
dignity flows from the reality that 
all humans are made in the image 
of God. When we see one another, 
we see the image of God.
In the ancient world, typically only kings were thought to be 
in the image of God. Genesis offers a striking contrast to a 
hierarchical view that sets rulers over those they rule or men 
over women. The point of the creation story in Genesis 1 is that 
all humankind is created at the same time and with the same 
value, in the image of God.
The account of creation in Genesis 2 emphasizes human 
dependence upon God as the one who gives us life and breath. 
In this text, God makes humans by forming them from the soil 
(humus), the source of trees and all vegetation. Humanity comes to 
life only when God breathes the breath of life into the first human.
In both Genesis 1 and 2, the emphasis is on God’s creation of 
humankind in unity and equality.7 A translation of the Hebrew text 
helps to explain this:
“[T]hen Yahweh God formed the earth creature [hā-’ādām]
dust from the earth [hā-ʼͣdāmȃ]
and breathed into its nostrils the breath of life,
and the earth creature [hā-’ādām] became a living nephesh 
[being]” (Genesis 2:7).8
In Hebrew, the word for “Adam” means “earth creature;” it is not 
a proper name but a poetic play upon the Hebrew word for earth. 
English translations of Genesis refer to “Adam” being formed 
first and refer to this earth creature as a male, but the original 
language never suggests that a man was created first.9 Rather, 
it recounts the creation of all humanity. Only later does the text 
refer to distinct bodies, called “Adam” and “Eve.”
Human dignity flows 
from the reality that 
all humans are made 
in the image of God. 
When we see one 
another, we see the 
image of God.
A Social Statement

The differentiation of humankind expressed in the creation stories 
communicates the joy humans find in having true partners, true 
peers: “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh” 
(Genesis 2:23a). God creates community and family within an 
interdependent creation that wholly depends upon its creator, not 
upon a hierarchy of humans.
The Scriptures reveal the diversity 
and interconnectedness of creation. 
God creates a teeming universe 
filled with plants and animals, the 
fish of the sea and the birds of the 
air, and humans—all remarkably 
diverse. We believe God creates 
humanity in diversity. Scientific 
research in conversation with the 
Christian tradition shows that 
this diversity encompasses a wide 
variety of experiences, identities, 
and expressions, including sex 
(human biology), gender (how humans understand and express 
themselves), and sexuality (sexual attraction).10 These are 
interconnected yet distinct aspects of humanity.
Many Christians, in the past and still today, interpret the creation 
and fall stories in Genesis 1-3 to support the belief that females 
are secondary to males and more sinful than males. For example, 
repeating an ancient belief, some early Christian theologians 
defined women as malformed men.11 Martin Luther sometimes 
repeated the idea that women are inferior. Genesis has also been 
used to argue for seemingly fixed realities about human identity 
based on being male or female.12 Some Christian communities and 
individuals continue to teach and practice these ideas.
The concept of “the image of God” has often been used 
problematically. Sometimes it has been used to describe men as 
a “fuller” image of God and women as a “lesser” image of God. In 
particular, the description of the woman being created second, to 
be the man’s “helper” (Genesis 2:18), has been used to reinforce

attraction).

the idea that women and girls are inferior and subordinate. 
Actually, the Hebrew word translated in English as “helpmate” 
is a word most often used in the Scriptures for God! Misuses, 
misunderstandings, and the limitations of translations have led to 
and still reinforce beliefs and actions that devalue women and girls.
This church focuses instead on God’s delight in the diversity 
of creation, as well as God’s intention of equality, unity, and 
relationality within that diversity. God says, “Let us make humanity 
in our own image.” Just as there is relationality among the persons 
of the Trinity, there is relationality between the humans God creates 
and between God and humans. This reading of the Scriptures 
promotes an understanding of human diversity that is not limited 
by either a binary or a hierarchical view of gender.
We honor the image of God in 
others when we do everything 
in our collective and personal 
power to meet others’ needs and 
to empower them to flourish. We 
believe that God creates human 
beings not just in marvelous 
diversity but also with the intention 
of equity, including gender-based 
equity. The God in whose image 
we are made calls us to use our creativity, freedom, responsibility, 
diversity, and compassion for the fulfillment of creation. Just 
as God uses wisdom, understanding, and knowledge to create 
and nourish (Proverbs 3:19-29), humans are to use these same 
means to serve all of creation. In creation, no human is granted 
domination over another human. Rather, all are given the 
responsibility to care for creation, including the responsibility to 
address the effects of sin (Genesis 1:26-31; 2:15).13
	
3) Despite God’s intention for creation, humans exist in 
a state of sin. Because we fail to trust God as we should, 
we are alienated from God, from other people, and from 
creation itself. Not only individually, but also collectively, we 
live out this alienation through disobedience to God, pride, 
Just as God uses 
wisdom, understanding, 
and knowledge to 
create and nourish 
(Proverbs 3:19-29),
humans are to use 
these same means to 
serve all of creation.

18
complacency, self-abasement, and acts against others, all of 
which limit the abundant life God intends.
As Christians, we understand humanity’s fall into a state of sin 
through the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. “‘[Y]ou 
will be like God,’” (Genesis 3:5b) the serpent promises. The Genesis 
story shows that the human desire to be powerful disrupts God’s 
intention for human flourishing and for the well-being of creation.
Sin is a condition in which we humans live because we do not 
trust God for our sense of identity and value.14 This may take 
the form of pride (being centered on ourselves), idolatry (placing 
someone or something else other than God at the center of our 
lives), or self-abasement (not recognizing our value and dignity as 
a person created by God). As a result of this broken trust in God, 
human relationships also become broken and distorted. We hurt 
each other, God’s creation, and ourselves.
Particular sinful actions (sins) 
are expressions of our human 
life in a state of sin. Individuals, 
families, communities, institutions, 
governments, and societies can 
all sin. Sin is not only individual; 
it is also collective or communal. 
Sinful humans create structures, 
organizations, and societies 
that perpetuate sin, sometimes unintentionally. This is called 
“structural sin.”
God gives the Law to help us see humanity’s sinful state—our 
sinful thoughts and actions and our sinful systems. It also helps 
to curb these. The Law helps us see that what breaks and distorts 
human relationships is sinful and unjust.
4) We believe that we are healed and redeemed from this 
alienation. That is, Lutherans confess that we are justified by 
God’s grace through faith in Jesus Christ, no matter what we 
have done or left undone. This promise means we are freed

from bondage to the people and things we trust and love more 
than God or the ways we try to justify ourselves, sometimes at 
the expense of others. God’s grace frees us and empowers us 
to love others as God loves all of creation.
The Lutheran tradition emphasizes that we do not have to do 
anything for God to be gracious to us. The gift of salvation is a 
divine work, not a human work. “For we hold that a person is 
justified by faith apart from works prescribed by the law” (Romans 
3:28). God’s justification of us overturns both our own attempts to 
justify ourselves and our own injustice. Faith unites believers with 
Christ; union with Christ transforms believers. God’s redemption 
of believers is not simply a transaction but an intimate relationship 
that influences who we are becoming in Christ.
Although we have been called into the freedom of the Gospel, 
we remain sinners. Martin Luther described this as being 
“simultaneously saint and sinner.” We are freed in Christ to love 
and serve others, but our efforts to live out God’s love are always 
imperfect. Through our baptism, we experience daily renewal, and 
so we continue to respond to the divine call to love God, self, and 
neighbor and to work for justice.
5) Our focus as Lutheran Christians on Jesus Christ affects 
how this church understands the call to do justice. Because 
we are freed in Christ for others, we are able to respond 
to God’s call to love our neighbor as ourselves. In society, 
neighbor love takes the form of neighbor justice.
The Scriptures repeatedly remind us of God’s call to show love 
and justice to others. The prophet Micah insists that what God 
wants from us is “to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk 
humbly with your God” (Micah 6:8). Isaiah provides some specific 
examples of what this means: “[L]earn to do good; seek justice, 
rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow” 
(Isaiah 1:17). The psalms describe the blessing of living according 
to God’s intention: “Happy are those who observe justice, who do 
righteousness at all times” (Psalm 106:3).
A Social Statement 
20
In the parable of the good 
Samaritan (Luke 10:25-33), Jesus 
teaches that compassion for others 
is how we express love for God; 
neighbors are people who need acts 
of love. Martin Luther reflected, 
“Now our neighbor is any human 
being, especially one who needs 
our help.”15 Neighbor love means 
we are called to be a neighbor. Depending on the neighbor’s 
needs, this may require not only direct service in response to an 
immediate situation, but also working more broadly for justice. 
Because justice is the form love takes in society,16 we refer to this 
as neighbor justice.
Faith active in the form of love of neighbor is not our own doing 
but God’s gift.17 We respond to and exercise God’s gift by loving 
others. In society, this responsive love takes the form of justice for 
the neighbor in an unjust world. Grounded in faith and love, we 
seek justice for ourselves and our neighbors within congregations, 
religious and secular institutions, governments, and societies. This 
love includes gender justice.18
Reading the Scriptures with a neighbor-justice perspective helps 
us challenge and uproot oppression, brokenheartedness, and 
captivity. This approach can be understood as an extension of the 
traditional Lutheran focus on interpreting the Scriptures through 
the vantage point of the proclamation of Christ. When, through 
the Scriptures, we have heard the Good News of justification by 
God’s grace through faith in Jesus Christ, we are able to return to 
the Scriptures, reading them in light of the call to live out our faith 
in service of our neighbors.
Striving for justice for the neighbor and for ourselves encourages 
Christians to live, worship, and work in ways that empower all 
people to live with dignity, responsibility, equity, and justice. God 
in Christ, through the power of the Holy Spirit, frees the Church 
to live now into the future God promises. Both as individuals and 
as communities, we are called into God’s new creation.
Neighbor love means 
working more broadly 
for justice. Because 
justice is the form love 
takes in society, we 
refer to this as neighbor 
justice. 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action

6) This focus on Jesus Christ also affects how we understand 
the Scriptures. While the Scriptures speak both Law and Gospel, 
Martin Luther emphasized that the Scriptures should be read 
by paying attention to what proclaims Christ—what carries the 
Gospel message of God’s grace and mercy to all people.
Lutherans understand the Scriptures as speaking both Law and 
Gospel—God’s judgment and God’s promise. Both Law and Gospel are 
God’s Word, but they have different purposes. God’s Law commands 
us to love God above all else and to live for the sake of the common 
good; it judges us when we fail. The Gospel is the promise of God’s 
grace and mercy freely given to us for Christ’s sake.
Luther taught that Christians should read the Scriptures through 
the lens of the Gospel promise: “The Gospel itself is our guide and 
instructor in the Scriptures.”19 Being guided by the Gospel helps 
Christians interpret difficult texts in the Scriptures in light of the 
Good News of Jesus Christ.
This way of reading the Scriptures also frees us to look at the 
Scriptures within their historical and cultural contexts.20 Some 
things apply to people in every generation, and some things 
do not. For example, Luther pointed out that some of the Old 
Testament laws were given by God to the Jewish people at 
particular times in their history; these laws do not necessarily 
apply to Christians today.21 Luther even warned against the 
temptation of “changing Christ into a Moses” by misunderstanding 
the gift and promise of the Gospel as laws and commandments.22
Because of this Christ-centered focus, Lutherans not only 
interpret but also translate the Scriptures in ways that keep 
proclamation of God’s Word central. When Luther translated the 
Scriptures from Hebrew and Greek into German, he took great 
care to use language that Germans of his day could understand. 
Sometimes this meant using common German idioms instead 
of a literal, word-for-word translation of the original languages. 
Sometimes this meant adding a word to emphasize the central 
proclamation.23 Luther always translated the Scriptures so that the 
living Word of God could be received by people in their context.

7) As Lutheran Christians, we recognize human reason and 
knowledge as gifts from God to be used for the common good. 
While the scriptural call to neighbor justice is clear, human 
reason and knowledge are essential to discern the specific 
forms, policies, and structures that best enable us to enact 
justice in particular contexts. Recognizing that the gifts of 
reason and knowledge are given to people of all religions and 
worldviews, Christians are freed to work together with them 
for the common good.
The Lutheran theological tradition 
places a strong emphasis on the 
appropriate use of human reason 
and knowledge. Thus, this statement 
draws on current scientific research, 
including the social sciences. It also 
assumes that such values as human 
rights are commonly shared. While 
sin can distort our use of these 
gifts, they remain important tools for work in the world, especially as 
common ground for working with others.
This church recognizes that people of other religions and 
worldviews may accept some of the analysis and share many of 
the convictions expressed here. For example, many individuals of 
other religions and worldviews believe that all people, including 
every woman and girl, deserve full human dignity, equality, equity, 
and the opportunity to thrive. Many others share the conviction 
of this church that all people have the responsibility to seek and 
safeguard universal rights for others, as well as for themselves.
With thanks to God for the gift of reason, the ELCA offers this 
statement as a contribution to public discussion about how to 
understand and advance full and equitable participation of women 
and girls in an equitable society. This statement is an invitation 
to conversation with and action by those who may not share the 
same starting point of faith but who share underlying values, such 
as human dignity. This church seeks to join in common cause with 
all who desire that all people may thrive.

8) We believe that the church is called to live as the body of 
Christ in the world even while we struggle with the realities 
of sin. As Lutherans, we recognize that acting justly within 
family, church, and society for the common good is central to 
the vocation to which God calls all people.
As Christians, we confess that Jesus Christ is the true image of 
God (Colossians 1:15). In baptism, all Christians are unified in 
Christ and are equal members of the body of Christ. The apostle 
Paul compared the early Christian community to the human body. 
He wrote that Christians are united in the body of Christ, that this 
body has many diverse parts, and that the members of the body 
need one another. Members of the body that we think are weaker 
than others are, in fact, indispensable. (See Romans 12:4-5 and 
1 Corinthians 12:12-18.) The body of Christ is made of physical 
bodies, of human persons. The health of the body of Christ is 
linked to our human flesh and blood.
In the face of ever-present ways in which we humans sin against 
each other, including in this church, we confess that God’s Word 
affirms the goodness of our bodies, minds, and spirits and 
those of our neighbors. The Gospels testify to the full, embodied 
humanity of Jesus, who was born, walked, ate, slept, and wept. The 
Hebrew Scriptures, the Gospels, and the New Testament letters all 
teach that human bodies are a good gift of God.
Because of our understanding of the body of Christ, we are called 
not to objectify other people, diminish their worth, or define them 
by gender-based stereotypes. Paul taught that what happens to 
one part of the body affects every part of the body. This church 
seeks to value all people and recognize that we depend upon one 
another. We will not dominate or politicize other people but will 
respect them, promote their health and well-being, and suffer and 
rejoice together as we strive for justice for all bodies—indeed, for 
all persons.

II. Analysis of the Problem:
Sin subverts human flourishing in many ways.
9) Though God desires fullness of life and equity for 
everyone, as a church we recognize that women and girls in 
particular suffer a range of harm and injustice due to sex 
(biological), gender, or both. In addition to sex and gender, 
the experiences of individuals and groups are shaped and 
complicated by intersecting factors. These include race, 
ethnicity, national origin, nationality (including American 
Indian and Alaska Native), religious identity, immigration 
status, sexuality, marital status, economic means, age, ability, 
embodied experiences, and education. This reality is known as 
intersectionality.24 This statement’s references to women and 
girls are intended to be inclusive of all people who identify 
as women or girls in the diversity of their individual and 
communal identities and expressions.
Grounded in the Scriptures and in Christ, the living Word of God, 
this church affirms that God creates humanity in diversity and 
desires all in creation to flourish. However, everyone does not 
flourish. Talking about this reality requires care and attention to the 
language and framework we use to understand the complexities of 
the situation and to serve all our neighbors adequately.
Intersectionality refers to the 
ways in which various forms of 
discrimination and oppression, 
linked to aspects of a person’s 
identity, overlap. The concept of 
intersectionality helps to express 
the multiple discriminations many 
women face daily. This church 
recognizes that each person is 
uniquely created in God’s image and that each person’s identity 
consists of different aspects. One individual might be a mother, an 
employee, a Christian, and a college graduate; she might be middle-
class, able-bodied, heterosexual, Spanish-speaking, and Latina. Some 
Intersectionality refers to

identity, overlap.

25
aspects of this woman’s identity are affirmed by the dominant 
culture in the United States (e.g., Christian, college graduate), yet 
other aspects are devalued (e.g., Spanish-speaking, Latina). Broadly 
speaking, the dominant culture treats some identities as ideal (e.g., 
white, able-bodied, heterosexual) and other identities as less than 
ideal, or even imperfect (e.g., person of color, older adult, lesbian). 
What the dominant culture affirms affects people’s lives.
Many women experience intersectional sexism. For a woman 
of color, sexism in the workplace is compounded by the 
discriminatory effects of racism. If someone is also transgender, 
data show staggering levels of discrimination and violence. 
Intersectionality helps to explain why some women and girls 
benefit more than others within a society that operates with 
intersectional patterns of dominance and submission. For 
example, white women in the predominant culture in North 
America benefit at the expense of women of color. This is 
illustrated in arrangements in which women of color are often 
caregivers for the children of affluent white women.
Therefore, references to women and girls in this document mean 
all people who identify as women and girls. A word such as women 
often fails to convey its full meaning because our minds tend to 
default either to our own experiences and identities or to what the 
culture validates as a normative, “desired,” or dominant meaning.
In the United States, the word women has been typically 
associated with being white, young, and heterosexual unless 
qualified with other adjectives. The life stories, challenges, hopes, 
and gifts of women of color, lesbian and other queer women, 
transgender women, women with disabilities, and immigrant 
women, for example, have been often ignored and sometimes 
maligned. By using women and girls to refer to us in all our 
diversity, this church seeks to shift our thinking from limitation or 
discrimination to inclusiveness.
This statement acknowledges both the usefulness and the 
complexity of the phrase women and girls. Social, cultural, 
economic, religious, and political groups use women to describe 
A Social Statement 
26
women’s experiences that differ from the experiences of many 
men. Nevertheless, the phrase should not be used to give the 
impression that all women and girls have the same experiences, 
gifts, or identities.
10) The experiences of women and girls from a variety of 
backgrounds, both in the past and in the present moment, 
reveal that they have often been restricted in realizing 
abundant life on the basis of sex (biological) or gender.
Women and girls from a variety of identities and backgrounds 
experience forms of oppression that affect our lives in profound 
and intimate ways. The personal experiences of women and girls 
are connected with larger social, institutional, and religious forces. 
For example, in the United States many legal rights were granted 
to women only over the course of the 20th century. These include 
the rights to vote, serve on juries, own land or businesses, inherit 
property, divorce, retain custody of their children, and attend any 
school for which they are qualified.
However, even when these rights were legislated, factors such as 
race and ethnicity, education, wealth, and social class intersected 
to exclude many women. This was the case for women of African 
descent, who struggled for many of those same rights decades 
later in the civil rights movement.  Even in the latter half of 
the 20th century, women still had to struggle to secure rights 
pertaining to voting, safety, health care, and public life.
Legal, social, and religious forces 
continue to curb women’s and 
girl’s rights and prevent them 
from affirming, celebrating, and 
expressing themselves fully as God’s 
good creatures and flourishing. The 
situation is extensive and complex.25 
Poverty and economic insecurity 
negatively affect women’s lives. Far 
fewer women than men have access 
to wealth, and in the United States 
Legal, social, and 
religious forces continue 
to curb women’s and 
girl’s rights and prevent

27
more women than men live in or at the edge of poverty. This is 
especially true for older adults, single women, divorced women, 
women of color, women living with disabilities, and child brides, 
which a number of states allow. Poverty rates among women and 
children in Native American and Native Alaskan communities, for 
instance, suggest that sexism is compounded by racism.
Women’s earnings are not equal to men’s earnings. Occupational 
pay disparities affect women’s earnings. More women than men 
work in service industries, which typically pay less than other 
occupations. In addition, women in the United States on average 
earn less than their male peers earn with equivalent experience 
and expertise. This wage gap is even wider for most women of 
color. Furthermore, there are wide income disparities within 
groups of women by race and ethnicity. The term glass ceiling 
refers broadly to gender-based limits on employment, but women 
of African descent also experience what is known as “the black 
ceiling,” and Asian women experience what is referred to as “the 
bamboo ceiling.”
 
Work, money, and violence often are intertwined. Some 
occupations, such as food service and agriculture, are particularly 
fraught with gender-based discrimination and violence. Workplace 
and educational harassment and assault directed at women and 
girls curtail their safety, productivity, and livelihood.
The ELCA has teaching and policy on gender-based violence that 
guides this church in greater specificity.26 On average, women, 
girls, and people with diverse gender identities experience high 
rates of gender-based violence. This violence includes but is not 
limited to domestic violence; intimate partner violence; sexual 
assault; rape; human trafficking; pornography; female genital 
mutilation; early and forced marriages; cyberbullying, stalking, 
and harassment; and murder.
Although men and boys experience some of these forms of 
violence, women and girls experience the majority of them at the 
hands of men and boys. Racism particularly compounds gender-
based violence for some communities of color. For example, the 
A Social Statement 
28
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have consistently 
reported that Native American and Native Alaskan women suffer 
greater rates of gender-based violence and assault than do other 
ethnic groups. Society often blames women for gender-based 
crimes and oppression, excusing the perpetrators. A prime 
example lies in this society’s culture of sexualized violence.
Objectifying and assaulting people, particularly sexually, has 
long been tolerated, often to the point where gender-based 
objectification and assault seem normal. Objectification and the 
normalization of assault are evident in the media we consume 
(including pornography),27 the games we play, the male role 
models we idolize, the jokes we tell, and the behaviors we tolerate. 
Many of these distortions spring from stereotypes, of not only 
white women, but also women of color. It is further evident in the 
low rates of conviction and penalty in rape cases and the high 
number of untested rape kits across this country. All these factors 
together can be described as rape culture.
U.S. health care policies and practices also affect women’s and 
girls’ very own bodies. Because health care in the United States 
has developed from a male-centered model of physiology, disease, 
and well-being, the medical system sometimes operates as if 
women do not know their own bodies or as if their bodies are not 
their own.
Here again, women’s health problems and the sexism of health 
care are compounded by intersectionality. For instance, women of 
African descent on all economic levels suffer from high rates of 
infant and maternal mortality, and many Latina women lack the 
reproductive and maternal health care they need.
A lack of affordable health care means many women do not get 
the care they need. In many regions, laws restrict women’s access 
to reproductive health care. In the 20th century, many women and 
girls were forcibly sterilized because they were considered less 
valuable than white or able-bodied women. Forced sterilization 
continues, often in prison systems.
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
29
Bodies are further managed, manipulated, exaggerated, and 
made invisible by the media based on age, skin color, and body 
type. Not every type of woman and girl is shown in the media. 
Entertainment, beauty, and fashion-industry standards and 
practices promote narrow, unrealistic images of “acceptable” 
women’s bodies, erasing “unacceptable” lines, spots, colors, or 
features. The ideals generated by these industries shape the way 
people think about their bodies. Many women and girls develop 
eating disorders or seek plastic surgery as they pursue an 
idealized version of womanhood or girlhood.
Despite this cultural obsession with “perfect” women, sports, 
journalism, and entertainment (including Hollywood movies) are 
largely focused on men and boys and what they do. Even language 
referring to people in society is male-identified, with words such 
as mankind, chairman, alderman, guys, etc.
Women constitute a minority in U.S. civic and business leadership. 
The number of women holding political office is growing but still 
significantly lower than in other nations. There are prominent 
women in business, but the total number of women in top 
leadership positions with access to wealth and decision-making 
is still disproportionately small. Women who do hold office and 
prominent leadership roles in society often experience overt and 
indirect hostility, including gender-based discrimination, speech, 
and threats.
Religious institutions in the United States may limit and prevent 
women and girls from affirming, celebrating, and expressing 
themselves fully as God’s good creatures and from flourishing 
as God desires. Women of color continue to be woefully 
underrepresented in religious leadership. In this church, for 
example, there are gender-based inequities and discrimination 
related to compensation and benefits, authority and leadership, 
and harassment and violence.28

11) The far-reaching harm experienced by women and girls 
is rooted in a pattern of power, privilege, and prejudice, the 
key elements in any social system of oppression. This is the 
basis of the ELCA’s understanding of racism.29 When power, 
privilege, and prejudice are associated with sex, gender, and 
sexuality, sociologists use the terms patriarchy and sexism.30
Patriarchy is a social system 
dominated by men, identified 
with men, and centered on men’s 
actions, voices, and authority. 
Patriarchy does not mean that 
males are bad and females are 
good, or that only males support 
this unfair system. However, in 
patriarchal systems, men are typically viewed as superior to 
women, are given more power than women, and have more 
authority than women. A patriarchal worldview and way of 
life grants male privilege. Sexism is the reinforcement of 
male privilege, which leads to discrimination. It promotes 
the silencing, controlling, and devaluing of women, girls, 
and people whose gender expression is different from the 
conventional expressions of masculinity and femininity.
Because people live within social and religious systems, everyone 
knowingly or unknowingly participates in this patriarchal 
system. Although patriarchy and sexism affect different people 
in different ways, as individuals we are socialized to conform to 
these patterns of power, privilege, and prejudice. This makes us 
complicit in maintaining social systems of oppression. 
Although the dominant culture in the United States often emphasizes 
individualism, the Scriptures and human reason also stress the 
importance of social or communal understandings of life and the 
world. To respond in love to the problems experienced by women, 
girls, and people who identify as non-binary, we must move beyond 
individual experiences to analyze how patriarchy functions as a 
social system. This church believes we need to address the roots of 
the problems that threaten abundant life.
Patriarchy does not 
mean that males are 
bad, and females are 
good, or that only 
males support this unfair 
system. 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
31
An honest assessment of patriarchy can be hard to face, yet it is 
necessary in order to address such a complex social reality. Harm 
and injustice result not simply from the acts of an individual or 
group but from policies, laws, attitudes, customs, habits, words, 
images, and religious beliefs and practices that inform and 
sanction those acts.
As a society, we have fostered patriarchal values that permeate 
our social organization and impair the distribution of goods 
and services, the application of justice, and the division of labor. 
Sexism (that which supports male privilege) affects human 
imagination and convictions, which influence how individuals 
and groups understand gender, human bodies, employment, 
immigration policies, and gender-based violence. Sexism sustains 
human trafficking and the politicization of the female body and 
health care, including reproductive health care.31
Because of our convictions about the right use of reason and 
knowledge in our shared pursuit of justice, this statement draws 
on the results of current scientific research as a basis for our 
work. A scientific consensus now holds that there are more 
than two biological sexes and more than two genders. Studies 
of humans reveal rich diversity, showing that individuals do not 
neatly fall into two categories. Some people are intersex: their 
bodies are neither male nor female. People have a diversity of 
characteristics, most of which cannot be assigned exclusively to 
one sex or gender or another. Among humans, sex and gender are 
more accurately characterized as multidimensional.32
It is not possible to address patriarchy and sexism without 
recognizing these scientific insights. Much harm has been caused 
by systems and worldviews that assume a binary division of sex 
(bodies) and gender (characteristics). These patriarchal systems 
enforce this binary division with various levels of control and 
violence that affect everyone.

12) Although men and boys often benefit from this social 
system, patriarchal structures and values also harm men and 
boys, including gay and transgender men. They are harmed 
when they are pressured to conform to narrow gender 
stereotypes or are unable to live out a false ideal of male 
superiority and control. People of all genders who do not 
conform to gender-based roles and stereotypes often are not 
seen or valued; sometimes they are violently oppressed and 
even killed. Men of all racial and ethnic minorities in North 
America may experience patriarchy and sexism particularly 
intertwined with white privilege. The message of white-
identified patriarchy and sexism is that men and boys of color 
are not fully men and boys.
Men and boys also suffer 
mentally, physically, emotionally, 
and spiritually from the 
dehumanization of patriarchy 
and sexism, which distorts how 
they see others and themselves. 
Misogyny, a deep-seated hatred 
of the female and feminine, is 
an ancient problem that still 
informs contemporary life, even 
when unintentional. Misogynistic 
values can instill men and boys with a false sense of superiority; 
patriarchy and sexism can contribute to exaggerated ideals 
of dominance and control, usually violent, that men and boys 
are expected to display. If they fail to match the ideal model of 
masculinity, they can be targets of hatred, harassment, bullying, 
and violence. These expectations go hand in hand with denying 
and suppressing vulnerability, empathy, and interdependence. This 
is toxic masculinity. The effect of toxic masculinity is that men 
and boys trying to live by its code hurt themselves and others, 
including other men and boys. The effect is harm to society.
The ideals of patriarchy and sexism can prevent men and boys 
from having meaningful friendships with other men and boys, and 
they are often punished when they try to resist male privilege or

to live in a way that is authentic to their sense of self. Cut off from 
emotions, interactions, activities, and careers that are stereotyped 
as feminine, men and boys are also denied the fullness of life that 
is God’s gift. Within broad social and religious systems, we can 
end up idolizing men and embracing toxic masculinity.
Although this is an overall picture of society, one should note that, 
within marginalized communities, patriarchy and sexism affect 
women and men differently. For example, while black lives and 
bodies are valued less than white lives and bodies in the United 
States, men of African descent may have more status within 
their communities than women of African descent do. This same 
pattern is largely true in many communities of color. However, 
within the broader society, men and boys of color are uniquely 
affected by sexism because white male privilege operates against 
them, too. The message is often that men and boys of color are 
not “real” men or boys. The pressure to conform to one idea of 
white, male-identified humanity denies the diversity of humans.
13) Some social and religious beliefs compound patriarchy. 
Most instances of gender-based harm are connected to 
commonly held beliefs and customs. For example, ideas that 
people are created into a hierarchy based on sex—being only 
male or female—reinforce and sometimes lead to gender-
based injustice.
Early church theologians were often misogynistic, describing 
women as “the devil’s gateway” and rebuking them as “a feeble race, 
untrustworthy and of mediocre intelligence.”33 Throughout much of 
the history of the Christian church, women were therefore excluded 
from Christian leadership, including ordained leadership; taught 
to be submissive in marriage, church, and society; and coerced to 
endure suffering and violence.
In the more recent past, the intersection of patriarchal violence, 
submission, and Christianity flourished in the mores and actions of 
colonialism. The United States was forged through this colonialism, 
and its patriarchal values continue to affect many people, including 
American Indian and Native Alaskan people, often in heightened 
A Social Statement 
34
ways for women and girls from these various communities. For 
example, the intersection of state and federal laws and tribal laws 
virtually eliminates successful legal recourse in cases of sexual 
violence against women and girls from these communities. More 
broadly, this is illustrated by how people of color continue to 
experience the negative effects of colonialism on mental health.
Misuse and misinterpretation of the Scriptures within 
contemporary Christianity have also reinforced viewpoints and 
teaching about the inferiority of women. Many Christian churches 
continue to support the subservience and obedience of women 
and girls to men, sometimes in subtle ways. For example, the 
belief and practice that men are meant to be the head of the 
church and the family and that women are meant to be the 
followers reinforce a gender-based hierarchy of importance, 
authority, and value.34 This is illustrated when some people rebel 
at having a pastor who is a woman or when they challenge her 
ministry, either subtly or explicitly.
Throughout history, human beings, including Christians, have 
often created hierarchies in which one group dominates another 
because of their differences. Not all hierarchies are inherently 
harmful, but hierarchies based on gender are. The Christian 
church has often reflected and taught a pre-Christian belief 
that all men and women are created with God-given dominant 
and subordinate roles. This idea that people exist within a 
complementary hierarchy continues to affect and infect people’s 
self-understanding and relationships.
Some Christians, both in this country and around the world, strongly 
believe that men and women were created to live in complementary 
relationships with clearly defined roles. This means that a person’s 
identity, self-understanding, vocation, and social roles are fixed at 
birth and willed by God according to sex (biological) and gender.35 
This understanding of complementary roles is sometimes described 
in terms of men and women as “opposites.”
Not all persons, however, experience or know themselves to be 
defined in these ways. Stereotypes about male and female 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
35
characteristics cause harm because they shape our understandings 
of ourselves and others from a very early age. Limiting certain 
roles to people according to their sex or gender interferes with 
the expression of their full humanity and the vision of abundant 
life for all people. Placing these limitations on individuals also 
diminishes the social and religious communities in which they live. 
The idea that humans are to experience life through gender-based 
hierarchies contributes to the overwhelming tendency to value 
what is male and/or masculine at the expense of what is female 
and/or feminine. The result is male privilege, often expressed 
through toxic masculinity.
In Christianity, male privilege has been and continues to be 
expressed through a male-identified, male-centered, and male-
dominant symbolic universe of language and images. Through 
its stories and theological tradition, the Christian imagination 
focuses on what men and boys say and do, even when women 
are part of the story of God’s people from the beginning. Within 
the Lutheran tradition, the same holds true for hundreds of years 
of Reformation thought, even though women were part of the 
Reformation movement. Male privilege leads to ignoring women’s 
presence, women’s experiences, and women’s voices.
14) The ELCA celebrates that humans are relational beings 
and that we live in social systems. Positive, equitable social 
systems can lead to joy and gladness. However, social systems 
can also have negative consequences.
Even though individuals make choices within social systems, 
those systems are more powerful than any individual, 
government, culture, or religious community. Beliefs and 
customs are reflected in laws, policies, and practices within 
both secular and religious institutions, which makes them so 
systemic that they are difficult to identify and dismantle.
This church’s commitment to neighbor justice compels us to 
expose how patriarchy and sexism are woven into individual, 
social, and religious life, causing harm to all people and even 
to all of creation.
A Social Statement 
36
Social systems are necessary because we are relational beings. 
When social systems are detrimental to well-being, the Scriptures 
refer to them as evil “powers.” (See Ephesians 6:12 and Romans 
8:38.) These powers dwarf any one individual, community, 
government, or culture, and they distort human flourishing. This 
church recognizes the systemic character of patriarchy in the way 
social and religious ideas and beliefs are linked with laws, policies, 
and practices that result in injustice. This combination of sexist 
ideas and beliefs with laws, policies, and practices leads to and 
reinforces gender-based harm and injustice, including gender-
based violence.
The effects of patriarchy and sexism diminish, damage, and 
often destroy people. Our church’s faith and a commitment to 
neighbor justice require us to examine the various components of 
patriarchy and sexism in order to understand the harm they cause 
and to seek renewed, life-giving partnerships and approaches to 
an equitable society. The call to justice specifically means that 
we seek equity and justice for women and girls and others who 
experience oppression due to sexism and patriarchy.
15) As Christians, we see that patriarchy and sexism prevent 
all human beings from living into the abundant life for which 
God created them. Patriarchy and sexism reflect a lack of 
trust in God and result in harm and broken relationships. 
Just as this church has identified racism as sin, this church 
identifies patriarchy and sexism as sin. We confess that, as 
God’s people forgiven in Jesus Christ, we are simultaneously 
liberated and sinful. We are broken, yet we are made new 
by grace through faith. This good news is true even as we 
participate in cultures and 
societies that are broadly 
patriarchal and sexist.
Sin is not expressed just in 
individual acts. Sin is also 
expressed in organizations and 
institutions. Sexism and patriarchy 
are sinful because they foster 
Sexism and patriarchy

37
attitudes and actions that distort relationships, violate God’s law, 
and result in injustice. They are social sins that involve and affect 
individuals, families, communities, nations, religions, and cultures.
Because they are so deeply imbedded in our social systems, the 
power of patriarchy and sexism can be largely invisible. Because 
it is invisible, we are often unaware that everyone participates in 
some measure, sometimes in obvious and intentional ways and 
sometimes in subtle and unconscious ways. We may hold attitudes 
and beliefs and support laws, policies, and practices that harm 
even ourselves. This is the power of systemic sin.
In our liturgy, we name this systemic reality in the confession: 
“We are captive to sin and cannot free ourselves.” Once we 
understand our own participation in this systemic harm, we can 
identify it as sin, confess it, and, through the grace and strength 
of God, begin to act differently. We reject patriarchy and sexism 
as sinful because they deny the truth that all people are created 
equally in God’s image and because they disrupt joy, gladness, and 
flourishing life for all people.
III. The Christian Tradition: 
It is both challenge and resource.
16) In faith, this church confesses that Christianity has been 
complicit in the sin of patriarchy and sexism through certain 
beliefs, practices, and aspects of its history. At the same time, 
we believe God provides resources within the Christian faith 
and the Lutheran tradition to challenge the harmful beliefs 
and effects of patriarchy and sexism and to bring forth new 
ways of living.
Some central emphases of Lutheran theology offer renewed vision 
and resources for resisting and dismantling patriarchy and sexism 
and for transforming social systems. This church believes that 
a Lutheran theological perspective rings true with insights into 
God’s gift that we are a new creation in Jesus Christ and can live 
more fully into that promise by the power of the Holy Spirit.
A Social Statement 
38
In our corporate confession, we 
recognize that we sin individually 
and collectively in thought, word 
and deed, by what we have done 
and by what we have left undone. 
We do not always live and act as 
God intends. God’s Law helps us 
to see that we sin and judges us 
for our failure to live up to God’s 
intentions. The recognition of our 
sins leads us to confession. When 
we confess, we give up trying to justify ourselves and our actions. 
By grace, God forgives us, heals us, and frees us from the state of 
sin that alienates us from God, neighbors, and ourselves.
As a church, we recognize that patriarchy and sexism harm 
people in many ways. As a church, we confess that we cannot 
justify our own participation in sinful ways of thinking, believing, 
and acting. We confess that our actions often reflect patriarchal 
Christian beliefs that portray women as subservient and inferior 
to men. As a church, we confess our complicity in the exclusion, 
exploitation, and oppression of those who do not reflect 
idealized understandings of masculinity. We confess not only 
overt complicity but also the complicity of silence and passive 
acceptance of patriarchal and sexist beliefs and practices.
As a church, we also believe and trust God’s mercy, love, and 
forgiveness. We trust that, through faith, God empowers us to 
identify resources for abundant and flourishing life within the 
Christian tradition, through which God has been at work through 
all people, including women. We believe that we share the 
responsibility to address the ways in which the Christian faith and 
tradition have been used to reinforce gender-based actions and 
attitudes that in particular harm women and girls from a variety 
of backgrounds, identities, and personal experiences.
17) The ELCA teaches that God’s Word of Law and Gospel 
speaks through the Scriptures. We also recognize that there 
are words and images, social patterns, and moral beliefs 
We do not always

intends. God’s Law 
helps us to see that we

in the Scriptures that reflect 
values rooted in what today 
we call patriarchy and sexism.  
Some aspects of the Scriptures 
reflect the cultures and societies 
in which they arose. Their 
continued misuse contributes 
to maintaining hierarchies 
and patterns of inequity and 
harm. A Lutheran reading of 
the Scriptures through Christ, 
focused on the devotional, historical, literary, and theological 
aspects of texts, frees us from the harm of taking all the 
Scriptures only literally.
Within the ELCA, we read the Bible in ways that are grounded in 
our theological heritage and that can reform sexist uses of the 
Scriptures. The Word of God is first and foremost Jesus Christ, 
God incarnate. Secondarily, we encounter the Word as Law and 
Gospel in preaching and teaching. The canonical Scriptures 
are the written Word of God, which proclaims God’s grace and 
sustains faith in Jesus Christ.36 The Word of God is living and 
active. We accept the written form of the Word of God as the 
authoritative source and norm for faith.
Nevertheless, we recognize that many biblical texts originated in 
cultures that were male-identified and male-dominated, and that 
they say things about women and girls that we now recognize 
as harmful. Genesis 3:16, “[A]nd he shall rule over you,” seems 
to support patriarchy if read as a reflection of God’s original 
intention for humans rather than as a result of human sin. Other 
Scriptural texts relate chilling acts of male domination, such as a 
host offering his unmarried daughter to a mob of men to dissuade 
them from raping a Levite man (Judges 19). Many Christian 
communities struggle with how to interpret such texts.
The New Testament reflects what now are understood as 
patriarchal values of various cultures through its rules and ideals 
about women. Scholars refer to these New Testament texts as “the

household codes.” One example seems to tie salvation to women’s 
fertility: “[Women] will be saved through childbearing, provided 
they continue in faith and love and holiness, with modesty” (1 
Timothy 2:15). Another example admonishes wives to obey their 
husbands and instructs them on how to dress. Although husbands 
are told to be considerate and respect their wives, they are told 
women are “the weaker sex” (1 Peter 3:1-7; see also 1 Corinthians 
11:6).
We recognize that the Scriptures have been interpreted within 
the Lutheran faith in ways that accept these limits on women 
and girls and sanction relationships of power and domination. 
Likewise, these interpretations grant men roles that afford them 
agency, decision-making power, leadership, and prominence in 
communities and societies. The result is an androcentric tradition. 
Our tradition’s complicity in patriarchy and sexism is connected 
to such biblical interpretation.
This misuse of the Scriptures continues to foster inequity based 
on sex (biological) and gender. It subverts the abundant life 
God intends. Even today some would deny women positions of 
leadership in the church or in society, calling the arrangement 
“natural” and citing such scriptural texts as “[W]omen should be 
silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but 
should be subordinate. … For it is shameful for a woman to speak 
in church” (1 Corinthians 14:34-35).
This church believes that God calls Christians into a different 
vision. Jesus Christ calls us to a new kind of freedom in service 
to God and neighbor. This is not a revision of the Lutheran 
tradition but a reaffirmation of its core emphasis. As Lutherans, 
we interpret the Scriptures in light of the Gospel promise. 
This emphasis on the Gospel as God’s promise characterizes a 
Lutheran reading of Scripture.
When scriptural passages are unclear or even contradictory, this 
Lutheran reading suggests that Christ, as God’s gift of forgiveness, 
reconciliation, and new life, is the lens through which such passages 
are to be read. Our church, for instance, places more weight on 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
41
Galatians 3:28 (“[T]here is no longer 
male and female; for all of you are 
one in Christ Jesus.”) because of its 
Gospel focus, than on 1 Timothy 
2:12 (“I permit no woman to teach 
or to have authority over a man.”). 
This church’s teaching about how to 
interpret the Scriptures reinforces 
this Gospel orientation. In this way, 
Scripture interprets Scripture.
This church emphasizes a fourfold reading of the Scriptures: 
devotional, historical, literary, and theological.37 We recognize 
that some passages were given to God’s faithful people in specific 
historical contexts that are quite different from our own.38 This 
is why, for example, Christians no longer feel bound by certain 
Old Testament laws, such as kosher dietary principles, or by New 
Testament instructions concerning women’s hairstyles, jewelry, 
and clothing (1Timothy 2:9). Our fidelity to the Scriptures does 
not require us to conform to the social and cultural practices of 
the ancient world. Similarly, this Lutheran interpretive practice 
extends to the writings of our tradition.
Although the Scriptures sometimes reflect patriarchal structures 
and values, this does not mean that God has prescribed 
patriarchal structures and values. We read the written Word 
guided by Christ the living Word speaking today. We do so for 
the sake of proclaiming a life-giving word for all people. This 
approach interprets the Scriptures with an emphasis on what the 
Word does; it frees us to read the Scriptures in such a way that 
God’s Word can be heard as genuinely “good news.”
18) The Christian theological tradition is full of ideas and 
teaching that can negatively or positively affect people. 
In particular, some doctrines affect our understanding of 
humanity and God more than others. Teachings about the 
cross and suffering, the image of God, the incarnation, the 
body of Christ, and the Trinity have sometimes been misused 
to support patriarchal beliefs, attitudes, church practices, 
Jesus Christ calls us to 
a new kind of freedom 
in service to God 
and neighbor. This is 
not a revision of the 
Lutheran tradition but a 
reaffirmation of its core 
emphasis.

42
behaviors, and structures. These teachings affect our use 
of language and our understandings of humanity and 
Christian ministry. At the same time, these doctrines can 
be liberating resources for healing the effects of the sins of 
patriarchy and sexism.
Theological images and themes are used in multiple ways. The 
same concept can be understood and applied to reinforce a 
patriarchal status quo or to support gender justice.
Two interrelated themes of Christian faith have often been 
misused to encourage women and girls to accept and endure 
harm because they are women and girls. Sometimes Genesis 3:16 
(pain in childbirth) is invoked to teach women and girls that they 
deserve gender-based suffering. Sometimes the language of taking 
up one’s cross (Mark 8:34) has been used to encourage women 
and girls to endure their pain in order to be like Jesus. Some 
women report that their pastors have characterized domestic 
violence or rape as “their cross to bear.”
Lutheran theology can help to reject the misuse of these biblical 
texts in such ways. First, Lutheran biblical interpretation reminds 
us that what is said to Eve about bearing children in pain has less 
to do with punishment than with pain humans experience after 
the fall.
Second, a theology of the cross can remind us that Jesus Christ 
suffers on our account. We are not called to endure violence for 
its own sake. We might endure violence because we confess faith 
in Jesus Christ and live as Christians, but women and girls are not 
called to endure gender-based violence. In addition, a Lutheran 
view of the cross reminds us that we see God hidden in suffering; 
despite Jesus’ feeling of abandonment on the cross, we can confess 
that God is present even in the depths of our worst experiences.
A number of other theological themes have also been misused 
to affect how Christians understand God and humanity. 
These teachings include the image of God (See Article 2.), the 
incarnation, the body of Christ, and the Trinity.39 It is important 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
43
to consider how these beliefs about God influence human self-
understanding and relationships.
The Christian tradition confesses 
that God is infinite mystery 
beyond human comprehension. 
Human language and human 
concepts about God are 
never enough to know God. 
Unfortunately, language for and 
images of God in the Christian 
faith are often androcentric—male-centered or male-identified. 
Insistence on predominantly male-oriented language and images 
restricts our understanding of God, who is beyond gender, to 
one human category. This narrows our theology, our thinking 
about God. The use of only male language leads us to forget the 
incomprehensible mystery of God and can reduce the living God 
to an understanding of God to the figure of an infinitely powerful 
man. This is flawed theology.
In addition, insisting on only male language can make maleness 
itself a false idol. It can persuade Christians that men have more 
in common with God than women do and thus that maleness is a 
higher form of humanity. This is flawed theological anthropology—
thinking about humans—and is pastorally harmful. If God is 
understood as male and women are seen as inferior to men, one 
can easily justify attitudes and behaviors that discriminate against 
and devalue women, girls, and people whose gender identity and 
expression fall outside of familiar categories. Taking God literally 
as male or only masculine also alienates people who are intersex.
Many voices in the Christian church have argued that the 
maleness of Jesus justifies sexist ideas and structures in church 
and society. Many Christians, including some in predecessor 
bodies of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, have 
argued that only men should serve as heads of the church 
and the home, in part because Jesus was a man. In the New 
Testament and in Christian thought, Jesus was often depicted 
as a groom promised to a bride (the church). Sometimes this 
Insistence on
predominantly male-
oriented language and
images restricts our
understanding of God,
who is beyond gender.
A Social Statement 
44
description of the church as the bride of Christ has contributed 
to a male-identified God and his male-identified representatives in 
relationship with a female-identified church.
We must reject the idea that the maleness of Jesus is somehow 
related to redemption. In the original Greek, the Nicene Creed 
makes clear that God the Son became human (an-thró-pous), not 
male (anér), “for us and for our salvation.” The point of the creed 
is Jesus’ humanity, not his sex or gender. The longtime generic 
use of the word man in English translations has obscured the 
original meaning of the Nicene Creed and fed patriarchal biases 
and assumptions.
The biblical narrative that Jesus was male, compounded by 
translations that default to androcentric language, has led 
to faulty assumptions about the maleness of the Trinity. 
However, the Scriptures and Christian theology witness to an 
understanding of God that transcends gender. They offer life-
giving ways to proclaim the Gospel so that all may receive it and 
share the Good News.
In the Scriptures, God is described as a mother in labor—also 
as a rock, a hen, and a bear (Isaiah 42:14, Psalm 89:26, Matthew 
23:37; Hosea 13:8). God is not literally any of these, just as God is 
not literally a man or a father. For instance, Jesus taught, “[W]hat 
woman having ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not 
light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds 
it?” (Luke 15:8). Through the prophet Isaiah, God declares, “Can a 
woman forget her nursing child, or show no compassion for the 
child of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget 
you” (Isaiah 49:15).
Teachers of the faith have amplified the multiple images within the 
Scriptures. St. Anselm of Canterbury wrote, “But you, Jesus ... Are 
you not that mother who, like a hen collects her chickens under 
her wing? Truly master, you are a mother.”40 Julian of Norwich 
wrote, “A mother can hold her child tenderly to her breast, but 
our tender mother, Jesus, can lead us in friendly fashion into his 
blessed breast by means of his sweet open side.”41
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
45
These and other teachers of the faith invert the Savior’s gender to 
say something important about faith in God through Jesus Christ. 
In fact, the Scriptures make use of gender inversion, such as 
when the apostle Paul compares himself in ministry to a mother 
in labor (Galatians 4:19). Jesus also subverted gender-based 
expectations when, washing his followers’ feet, he cast himself in 
the role of a female slave or a wife—and then called on the male 
disciples to do the same thing (John 13: 3-5, 15).
At the same time, this church’s understanding of the body of 
Christ goes beyond the literal, physical body of Jesus. As Galatians 
3:28 reminds us, the body of Christ is inclusive; identity markers 
that we have regarded as irreconcilable no longer hold meanings 
that divide us. Just as “Jew or Greek” are not the only ethnic 
identities joined to and in Christ, so “male and female” do not limit 
the gender identity of those joined to and in Christ. Understanding 
the unity in Christ of persons of various identities frees us from 
the idolatry of the maleness of Christ—or of human maleness.
Although most Christian liturgy favors androcentric and 
Eurocentric language and imagery, expansive language and 
imagery are both scripturally rooted and theologically faithful. In 
their paradoxes and multiplicity, they communicate the mystery 
and intimacy of the triune God. Using inclusive and expansive 
scriptural and theological language and images therefore honors 
the Lutheran tradition. This church commends all Christians to 
retrieve and reform theological language, images, and themes so 
that they support faithful proclamations of God’s grace in Jesus 
Christ to all persons.
19) The central Lutheran belief that we are justified by grace 
through faith empowers this church to challenge patriarchy 
and sexism, which devalue people according to sinful human 
standards.
A robust understanding of justification by grace enriches a 
Christian commitment to gender justice. A Lutheran expression 
of the doctrine of justification underscores gender justice as a 
concern of faith in three ways.42
A Social Statement 
46
First, justification is wholly God’s work through Christ; we cannot 
justify ourselves. Justification as God’s act challenges the self-
centeredness of self-justification, of trying to put ourselves above 
or before others, as with male privilege. From a Lutheran faith 
perspective, no particular group is superior to another based on 
sex (biological) or gender. Because God redeems us, we cannot 
rely on a belief that one group can justify themselves in the world 
or with God because of their supposed superiority or “headship.” 
Sin and grace are great equalizers. All Christians are sinful, and all 
Christians are equally dependent upon God’s grace.
Second, justification frees us from bondage. Being freed in Christ 
involves being freed from all that tries to replace Jesus Christ as 
Lord in our lives, including systems of patriarchy. This reality 
changes our life with respect to issues of sex and gender. We 
are freed to recognize God’s work in creation through human 
variation, human imagination, and human expression of gender. 
We are able to see that humans are not created to be limited in 
our experience of being human through a gender-based hierarchy.
Third, justification gives Christians the freedom of a new 
perspective—to be more concerned with what the neighbor needs 
and less concerned with following and enforcing gender-based 
rules and assumptions. We are freed to see and support one 
another in all our uniqueness. Justification helps us to see gender 
justice from the perspective of faith.
20) The Lutheran understanding of the sacraments of 
Baptism and Holy Communion, in which the Word of God is 
connected with tangible, physical elements, grounds efforts 
to prevent the harm that sexism and patriarchy cause to the 
bodies, minds, and spirits of human beings.
Lutheran theology can help reorient sexist and racist theology and 
practices that limit the full participation of varied human bodies in 
the sacraments. According to the Lutheran Confessions, when the 
material things of water, bread, and wine are combined with God’s 
Word, God is really present: “Baptism is not simply plain water. 
Instead it is water enclosed in God’s command and connected with 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
47
God’s Word.”43 When we feel the water of baptism and consume 
the bread and wine of the eucharist, God is present to our diverse, 
individual bodies and in the unity of the church that is the body of 
Christ. Drawing on the apostle Paul, Luther taught that the Lord’s 
Supper unites us in one body: “[S]o that by this sacrament … and 
through this mutual love there is one bread, one drink, one body, 
one community.”44
We must continue to embrace our unity and diversity so that we 
welcome and uplift people of every sex (biological) and gender—
indeed, every body—in our work together as the body of Christ in 
the world. God’s love feeds the body of Christ so that it might live in 
love. The sacramental promise that God is present in water, bread, 
and wine, along with the good news that God became human, leads 
this church to treasure, hold, and advocate for the embodied lives 
of all people.
21) The ELCA has identified sufficiency, sustainability, 
solidarity, and participation as the key principles for creating 
and supporting justice.45 This church commends these 
principles to create and support neighbor justice, specifically 
gender justice for the neighbor. Social and religious structures 
and institutions—including ideas, beliefs, religious teachings, 
laws, policies, practices, and language—must be assessed and 
should be guided by these principles.
As Lutherans, we understand that 
God intends not only individuals, 
but also cultures and governments, 
to develop in ways that enable 
all people to flourish. With other 
members of society, we affirm the 
national ideal toward which people 
in the United States continually 
strive—that all people are created 
equal and endowed with inalienable 
rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness. We also believe that all people have the responsibility 
to safeguard these rights for others as well as themselves. Insofar 
As Lutherans, we 
understand that God 
intends not only 
individuals, but also 
cultures and 
governments, to 
develop in ways that 
enable all people to 
flourish.
A Social Statement 
48
as this ideal allows everyone to flourish, the ELCA joins people of 
other religions and worldviews to advance a universal vision of an 
equitable society in which all people participate fully.46
Although we recognize that perfect worldly justice is not 
possible, this church holds that efforts toward justice should 
stress the principles of sufficiency, sustainability, solidarity, and 
participation. These principles guide us away from injustices 
against women and girls from a variety of backgrounds, identities, 
and personal experiences and toward justice for all those affected 
by patriarchy and sexism.
The principle of sufficiency inspires us to meet the basic needs 
(physical, emotional, intellectual, social, and spiritual) of all 
women and those who depend on them. This means, for example, 
that society must protect them from violence and provide them 
with equitable opportunities in education and employment. The 
principle of sufficiency supports not only passive respect but also 
advocacy in matters of health care, immigration, violence, human 
trafficking, and the workplace, for example.
The principle of sustainability 
compels society to provide all 
generations of women with the 
means toward an acceptable quality 
of life. This applies to both the 
emotional and the material aspects 
of life. Both church and society 
should evaluate how their structures 
ensure—or fail to ensure—that all 
people have livelihoods and the means for well-being.
The principle of solidarity commits society to see and experience 
our own well-being as connected to the well-being of others and 
their communities. It often involves people aligning themselves 
with others who have different experiences. Solidarity 
encompasses empathy and respect for the lived experience of 
women and girls; it encourages people not only to share in their 
suffering but also to participate in their liberation.
Both church and society 
should evaluate how 
their structures ensure—
or fail to ensure—that all 
people have livelihoods 
and the means for well-
being.
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
49
The principle of participation urges us to structure our 
communities so that women participate equitably in the 
personal, local, and political decisions affecting their lives. All 
people need to participate in the structures that affect their lives 
and the decisions that affect their communities. No one’s access 
to decision-making should be limited by sex or gender.
22) The ELCA recognizes that some progress has been 
made to address patriarchy and sexism and to reduce their 
effects; however, more effort is required. We believe that this 
church, together with many other partners, can identify 
and challenge the complexities of patriarchy and sexism 
and advance equity. Gender-based equity happens through 
beliefs and ideas that are gender-just and through laws, 
policies, and practices that support an equitable common 
good— abundant life for all.
Working together, people from many walks of life have brought 
about change in the North American context, diluting the power 
of patriarchy and sexism. Positive social and religious views 
about gender have influenced laws and policies that advance 
women’s rights; conversely, changes in laws have positively 
influenced social and religious views. This nation and this church 
have seen and supported many positive changes in attitudes and 
laws that have helped women and girls to thrive, but more work 
remains to be done to support neighbor justice.
Individuals and groups must challenge harmful social ideas and 
practices, reject sexist religious beliefs, and work to change laws, 
policies, and practices that justify and reinforce patriarchy. When 
enough people—especially people of faith—work, pray, stand, 
and struggle together, they can transform attitudes, beliefs, laws, 
policies, and practices so that all people of all sexes and genders 
enjoy God’s vision of abundant life.

IV. Response: The ELCA is called to new commitments 
and action as a church.
23) Propelled by these theological convictions and the robust 
resources of the Lutheran heritage, this church responds 
to God’s call to justice with the following commitments to 
promote and support action toward a more equitable life 
together in Christ.
This section draws out the implications of this statement’s 
convictions, analysis, and resources in our tradition. It sets forth 
this church’s commitments to reshape beliefs, attitudes, policies, 
and practices. Inevitably, meeting such commitments draws 
upon judgments of reason in discerning what exactly must be 
done, when it must be done, and how. The process may involve 
difficult conversations and unforeseen challenges calling for both 
determination and patience. The particulars may well be subject 
to correction and further deliberation. This church, however, views 
the following commitments as a signal that our life together in 
Christ can be renewed in ways that promote and support greater 
equity and justice.
24) This church recognizes that the body of Christ is called 
to honor and support women and girls from a variety of 
backgrounds, identities, and personal experiences in ways 
more consistent with life-giving theology and faith practices. 
As a church, we commit ourselves to celebrating and 
affirming the gifts and insights that women and girls bring to 
every expression and dimension of this church.
Over the centuries, women have carried immense responsibility 
in serving the church despite being denied ministerial authority. 
They have served through religious education, music, elder care, 
parish nursing, and Bible study. They have pursued their vocations 
in myriad ways that support the growth of the Gospel and the life 
of their local congregations. The Lutheran movement, including 
the ELCA, has only begun to recognize how we have failed to 
honor the full range of Spirit-given gifts that have equipped 
women and girls to serve.
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
51
The fundamental commitment needed, then, is not to a particular 
program, practice, or process. Rather, we are called to repentance 
that reorients perspectives and actions, and we commit to 
encouraging, celebrating, and affirming the full range of gifts 
prepared by the Spirit for use in every expression and dimension 
of this church.
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America specifically 
commits to:
25) Promote the practice and use of scriptural translation 
and interpretation that acknowledge the contexts in which 
the Scriptures were written and reject the misuse of Scripture 
that has supported sexist attitudes and patriarchal structures.
Drawing deeply upon our Lutheran heritage, the ELCA promotes 
an understanding of Scripture that both honors its Word-centered 
purpose and acknowledges its historical sources and contexts. 
This church listens to God’s Word speaking through the Scripture 
to sustain Christian faith and empower the community for service 
and justice in the world.
Mindful of how the Christian Scriptures, through translation 
and interpretation, have been misused to support patriarchal 
structures and sexist attitudes, this church will promote 
translation and scriptural interpretation sensitive to the 
concerns of this statement.47 Scriptural texts in which females 
are degraded, terrorized, debased, dominated, or valued less 
than males should be interpreted in light of God’s resolve for 
abundant life through Christ.
26) Promote theological reflection that responds to the 
gender-based needs of the neighbor. Teachers and theologians 
need to be honest about how church teachings have been 
misused to support patriarchy and sexism. More importantly, 
this church calls upon its teachers and theologians to work 
toward worthier expressions of the historic faith that honor 
God’s desire for all people to thrive.
A Social Statement 
52
This church affirms the gifts of the Lutheran Christian tradition—
the faithful witness of the Confessions, the power of the preached 
Word, and the reflection of theologians. At the same time, in recent 
decades this church has begun to recognize how these treasured 
gifts have sometimes been misused. Even while proclaiming the 
life-giving Gospel and the call for service and justice, preachers 
and theologians often have omitted or suppressed the stories, 
reflections, and experiences of women and girls. For some, this 
suppression has contributed to a crisis of faith.
The commitment to articulate and proclaim the Christian faith in 
a more inclusive manner calls for renewed efforts from preachers, 
teachers, and theologians. It means preaching and writing that 
make full use of stories and insights from the lives of women 
and girls with a variety of backgrounds, identities, and personal 
experiences. It involves teaching and preaching about justification 
and a theology of the cross that recognize how the motifs of 
Christlikeness and suffering have been used harmfully. It entails 
teaching and research that reflect transformative understandings, 
with special concern around key doctrines such as Christology 
and creation.
27) Use inclusive language 
(all genders) for humankind 
and inclusive and expansive 
language (other than human) 
for God. This church is 
committed to the deepest 
Christian understanding of the 
Trinity revealed through Jesus 
Christ and to the importance 
of imagining and speaking about God in faithful ways 
that expand rather than limit the expression of God’s self-
revelation and mystery. In particular, we support developing 
liturgies, hymns, prayers, and educational materials that 
broaden use beyond predominantly masculine language. This 
practice follows the scriptural witness that God transcends 
human categories. Therefore, as in the Scriptures, metaphors 
for and images of God should be drawn frequently from the

developing liturgies, 
hymns, prayers, and 
educational materials 
that broaden use

53
lives of people of all identities and experiences and gleaned 
from nature in all its diversity. Employing inclusive and 
expansive language for and images of God helps human beings 
approach and encounter the God of beauty and love who 
reveals God’s self to humanity in rich and mysterious ways.
Words are powerful because they shape how humans relate to 
one another. For this reason, the ELCA has long urged inclusive 
language regarding human beings in both worship and everyday 
use.48 This statement reinforces that commitment. This church 
urges renewed efforts to move us together from the habits of 
predominantly male-oriented wording to language that embraces 
all people.
Words about God carry even greater substance and subconscious 
meaning because they are religious symbols. The God revealed in 
Christ defies all human comprehension and speech. Still, humans 
must use words and images to pray and praise. The words that 
are used carry historical depth and communal power and have 
meaning for an individual’s self-understanding and relationships.
Moving beyond exclusive language 
and imagery presents a complex 
challenge, both personally 
and communally. Changing or 
expanding Christian symbolism 
may be both unsettling and life-
giving. For instance, paternal or 
maternal references to God may 
be liberating for some people but 
deeply painful for others. Despite 
the complexity, this church urges 
Christians to work together to confront the problem of exclusive 
language and imagery because these contribute significantly to 
patriarchal religious beliefs and practices.
The formulation of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is at the center of 
the conversation. Many Christians think this is the only correct 
way to speak of God, which reinforces exclusively masculine

associations. Others think that the traditional Trinitarian 
formulation should be changed or discarded because it promotes 
a faulty understanding of God as essentially male.
The ELCA affirms the creedal witness to the mystery, relations, 
and actions of the three persons of the Trinity. At the same time, 
this church holds that exclusive use of a male-oriented formula 
to refer to God is problematic. The use of expansive language for 
God reflects faithfulness to God’s self-revelation in the Scriptures 
and in human experience.
In our life together, we call upon leaders and members to enlarge 
the dialogue about and practice of inclusive and expansive 
language and images for God. It is vital to explore the often-
neglected variety of symbols for God recorded in the Scriptures, 
and to plumb the historical insights found in theology and 
religious art. In this spirit, this statement urges the continued 
exploration and development of expansive liturgies, hymnody, and 
worship resources.
28) Develop and support more extensive policies and practices 
within the ELCA that promote equitable authority and 
leadership within this church in all its expressions. In many 
instances this requires promoting the leadership of women, 
with special concern for women of color. In other cases, this 
means promoting the participation of men in more varied 
roles, including those traditionally seen as “women’s work.”
In the 1970s, the three predecessor churches of the ELCA made 
independent decisions to ordain women for the public ministry 
of Word and Sacrament.49 While multiple viewpoints were argued, 
these churches concluded that the Scriptures present a mixed 
record regarding ordination and that nothing definitive precluded 
women from serving in this office.
Since then, the experience of this church has shown those 
decisions to be God-pleasing, consistent with the words of the 
prophet Joel (Joel 2) and embodied in the Pentecost story of Acts 
in which the Spirit falls upon all without respect to age, gender, 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
55
nationality, or ability (Acts 2). Women serving in lay leadership, 
ministries of Word and Sacrament, and ministries of Word and 
Service have borne powerful witness to the Gospel and enlivened 
this church’s ministry. However, individual journeys have been 
difficult for many, and the communal journey since 1970 has been 
agonizingly slow.
In light of this experience, this church gives thanks, rejoices, and 
remains committed to developing and supporting additional policies 
and practices that promote women’s authority and leadership 
within the ELCA, both rostered and lay. Given the continual 
struggles of women of color for acceptance, equity, and leadership, 
this church’s commitments with them require special attention.50
This commitment to confront continuing sexism and promote 
equitable authority and leadership of women belongs to the entire 
church. It also includes encouraging men to seek more varied 
roles in lay service and on the roster of Word and Service.
The commitment speaks to, but is not limited to, call committees, 
boards, and councils. It requires attention to formal and informal 
mentoring and succession planning. It requires attention to 
practices in seminaries, colleges and universities, social ministry 
organizations, preschools and grade schools, and youth ministries. 
Together we can open ourselves joyfully to the Spirit, who clearly 
has used the gifts of female leadership to enhance and empower 
her work.
29) Promote changes that are economically just, including 
equitable pay and benefits, for women in all ELCA institutions 
and organizations, with special attention to the situations of 
people affected by intersecting forms of discrimination.
In support of women’s authority and leadership, this church must 
continue to seek new ways to redress economic injustice. As of 
this writing,51 rostered women of the ELCA average higher pay 
than ordained women nationally but their compensation remains 
inequitable compared to that of men within the ELCA. The ELCA 
is called to renew efforts to support equitable benefits and pay 
A Social Statement 
56
across our church. These should include particular attention to 
women affected by intersecting forms of discrimination.
These efforts should not overlook the economic concerns of lay 
women serving in church callings, including those serving in 
less-recognized roles such as office administrators, preschool 
teachers, or in ministries of hospitality. The various organizations 
and institutions of this church need to review their compensation, 
including insurance and other benefits.
Finally, this church needs to offer greater support for women’s 
ministry and leadership in policies related to pregnancy, parental 
leave, and breastfeeding. Improved arrangements for ELCA 
rostered leaders and for employees of ELCA-related organizations 
and institutions should support these leaders and demonstrate 
this church’s commitment to family.
30) Seek and encourage faithful dialogue, discernment, 
and, when possible, joint action on issues of patriarchy and 
sexism with other members of the body of Christ and with 
partners of other religions and worldviews. As a member of 
a global communion, the ELCA affirms the Lutheran World 
Federation’s “Gender Justice Policy.” (www.lutheranworld.org/
sites/default/files/DTPW-WICAS_Gender_Justice.pdf)
Governed by the framework of this statement, we in this church 
acknowledge our responsibility to continue to address our own 
actions, attitudes, policies, and practices as members of the body of 
Christ. We believe that the Holy Spirit is leading faithful Christians, 
as well as people of diverse religions and worldviews, into deeper 
discernment about questions of patriarchy and sexism.
In our own exploration of these issues, we seek whenever 
possible to engage our Christian siblings in mutual discernment 
and common action, acknowledging our own complicity in 
patriarchy and sexism. This approach is apparent in the ELCA’s “A 
Declaration of Ecumenical Commitment”: “The first word, which 
the Church speaks ecumenically, may well be a word of self-
criticism, a word against itself, because we are called to be seekers 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
57
of a truth that is larger than all of us and that condemns our 
parochialism, imperialism, and self- preoccupation.”52 Dialogue, 
while necessary and mutual, begins through self-examination.
Given the diverse but strongly held perspectives in society and 
throughout Christ’s church, conversations about patriarchy 
and sexism can be challenging as well as promising. ELCA 
leaders and members encounter commitments and perspectives 
among neighbors of other religions and worldviews that are 
quite different from those endorsed by this statement. In our 
commitment to engage with and accompany our neighbors, 
we need to be clear about ELCA social teaching but also listen 
carefully to different ideas. This is part of how we seek mutual 
understanding and pursue neighbor justice. The goal is to join in 
honest conversation and to challenge each other to greater justice 
while accompanying women and girls in their own contexts.
The ELCA is grateful for the faithful and courageous witness of 
our global communion, the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). 
While this ELCA social statement is situated in the diverse cultural 
context of the United States, we recognize the biblical rationale, 
principles, and methodology of the LWF “Gender Justice Policy” as 
a global benchmark toward conversation and common practice. In 
a spirit of “mutual conversation and consolation,”53 the ELCA will 
continue to accompany and to be accompanied in implementing 
that policy within the global Lutheran community. Similar efforts 
by the World Council of Churches, supported by local and regional 
councils, also encourage us in our collective task.
We invite ecumenical partners, 
especially full communion 
partners, to work with us for 
gender justice in church and 
society. The fundamental biblical 
commitment to justice should 
undergird and guide our common 
attention to the problems caused 
by patriarchy and sexism, even 
when we have different ideas about how to remedy these

problems. In those areas where we are not of one mind in our 
discernment, we will continue to walk together in the bond of 
Christian unity, seeking the Spirit’s leading.
We also invite partners of other religions and worldviews, 
especially where we serve together in coalition, to continue to 
collaborate with us whenever possible in seeking justice for 
women and girls. That search is integral to the common good.
V. Response: The ELCA calls for action and new 
commitments in society.
31) This church teaches that the God who justifies expects all 
people to seek justice in earthly relationships, structures, and 
systems. The ELCA calls for sustained and renewed efforts 
through which women, girls, and gender nonconforming 
people experience greater equity and justice. The following 
commitments express this church’s firm hope for renewed social 
relationships and structures that benefit the common good.
The Scriptures are clear that the God who justifies is the 
same God who insists that “justice roll down like waters, and 
righteousness like an ever-flowing stream” (Amos 5:24). The ELCA 
affirms that God’s Law, in its civil use, permeates and undergirds 
basic structures of human society to support life and protect all 
people in a world that remains under the sway of sin. God works 
through shared human endeavor and intends that all people work 
together to deter evil and seek justice.
Lutheran Confessional teachings identify the primary structures 
of human society—the church, family, civil authority, and economic 
arrangement—as God’s gifts. Justice is the measure by which God’s 
Law guides and assesses these basic structures. Social structures 
and institutions that fail to do justice are not fulfilling the purpose 
for which God created them. They must be challenged and held 
accountable; this is a matter of great urgency because human life 
depends upon them.
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
59
In seeking the well-being of the human community, the Lutheran 
tradition places a strong reliance upon human reason and 
knowledge tested and exercised through the sciences and social 
analysis. Although imperfect, social movements—enlivened by the 
insights of human reason and knowledge—can be expressions of 
God’s work through the Law to bring about greater justice and 
social liberation. The women’s movement, broadly understood, is 
one of these.
In identifying the following aspects 
of society that require engagement, 
this church does not presume to 
have quick or easy solutions for 
the deeply rooted, intertwined, and 
complex problems that permeate 
earthly systems and structures. 
Time, study, effort, and discernment 
are required. Nevertheless, it is 
both a clear biblical teaching 
and a matter of neighbor justice 
that God’s people hold governing 
authorities and social structures 
accountable to their purpose, 
ensuring greater equity and justice for all.54 These commitments to 
advocate for and support social renewal express this church’s firm 
trust that God works to create improved social relations.
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commits itself to:
32) Advocate for and support laws, policies, and practices that 
respect diverse bodies rather than discriminating against, 
objectifying, or devaluing them. Women, girls and people 
who identify as non-binary must not be deprived of their 
human or civil rights. (See the ELCA’s social message “Human 
Rights,” ELCA.org/socialmessages.) 
ELCA social teaching supports human rights for all people, 
regardless of their sex (biological), gender, or sexuality. This 
stance is rooted in respect and welcome for all people as created

in the image of God and evident in the ELCA’s longstanding 
commitment to protecting civil and human rights. While 
members may hold differing views on matters related to sexual 
orientation or gender identity,55 this church is nevertheless 
united in opposing discrimination, objectification, abuse, or 
control of the bodies of women, girls, or individuals who identify 
as genderqueer.56 The ELCA’s commitment to civil and political 
rights helps to orient the changes and challenges addressed in 
the following commitments. Minimal steps include developing 
and enforcing laws, policies, and practices that do not deprive 
any people of their human or civil rights.
33) Advocate for and support the eradication of gender-based 
violence within the church and more broadly in society by 
addressing both the systemic aspects of such violence and 
the personal responsibility of those who perpetrate harm. 
(See the ELCA’s social messages “Gender-based Violence” and 
“Commercial Sexual Exploitation,” ELCA.org/socialmessages.) 
All people deserve safety and protection from violence, along with 
due process and support when violence is experienced. Although 
anyone may experience gender-based violence, the overwhelming 
number of attacks target women, girls, and individuals who identify 
as genderqueer. Such violence often occurs in domestic settings, yet 
gender-based violence includes any physical, sexual, psychological, 
emotional, economic, or other personal harm inflicted on someone 
for reasons of gender, regardless of the setting.57
Although individuals are ultimately responsible for their actions, 
gender-based violence is rooted in systemic sin. A patriarchal 
social system affirms, sometimes implicitly, that women and 
girls should be controlled or subordinated. In this way, it 
underwrites, justifies, or at least permits acts of violence, whether 
by individuals or communities. Patriarchy, even when seemingly 
harmless or unrecognized, often reinforces the conditions, 
attitudes, and values that undergird harmful action.
The wide scope of theological, pastoral, and societal matters 
related to gender-based violence is addressed in the ELCA’s social 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
61
message “Gender-based Violence.”58 In it, this church calls upon 
itself and upon society to resist and change harmful attitudes, 
beliefs, and systems. This social statement affirms the analysis, 
insights, and commitments expressed there.
34) Advocate for and support medical research, health care 
delivery, and access to equitable and affordable health care 
services, including reproductive health care, that honor 
how bodies differ and eliminate discrimination due to sex 
(biological), gender, or sexual orientation. (See the ELCA 
social statements Caring for Health: Our Shared Endeavor 
and Abortion, ELCA.org/socialstatements.) 
The ELCA teaches that a just society provides equitable access to 
health care for all.59 Health is a shared endeavor, requiring both 
personal responsibility and social commitment. “Health care is the 
kind of good most appropriately given on the basis of need.”60
The U.S. medical system is widely recognized as a global leader 
in research, prevention, and treatment. As a church, we are 
grateful for amazing medical advancements. At the same time, 
U.S. health care has carried a bias against women and girls in its 
practice and delivery.
This church gives thanks for those who have drawn attention 
to these problems. We urge everyone in medical research and 
health care delivery to recognize that diverse bodies have differing 
needs. We look for further advancement in medical research 
and the health care system, both rural and urban, that eliminate 
discrimination based on sex and gender, economic resources, 
ability, ethnicity, or race.
This statement affirms previous ELCA teaching on reproductive 
health care. Such care is to be provided according to need in 
all cases,61 and this church opposes any effort to roll back that 
delivery. While questions about how best to organize and finance 
mechanisms of care leave room for legitimate debate, the mandate 
for equitable access to reproductive health care remains.
A Social Statement 
62
The ELCA social statement Abortion (ELCA.org/socialstatements) 
addresses in a nuanced way this critical, complex, and 
controversial aspect of reproductive health care. It teaches that 
the life and decisions of someone who is pregnant, as well as 
the developing life in a womb, must be respected and protected 
through a complex assessment of moral and social factors.
 
On that basis, this church teaches that abortion ought to be an 
option of last resort for pregnant persons and the people in their 
lives. At the same time, ELCA teaching opposes laws that deny 
access to safe and affordable abortions. It urges efforts to reduce 
the conditions that encourage many to turn to abortion as the 
response to unintended pregnancy.62
35) Advocate for and support economic policies, regulations, 
and practices that enhance equity and equality for women 
and girls, with special concern for raising up women and girls 
who experience intersecting forms of oppression. (See the 
ELCA’s social statement Sufficient, Sustainable Livelihood 
for All, ELCA.org/socialstatements.)
Through human decisions and actions, God intends economic 
arrangements to support human thriving. This church’s 
benchmark on economic arrangements is that they should provide 
“sufficient, sustainable livelihood for all.”63
The U.S. economic system has made notable movement in this 
direction for women over the last 40 years. However, economic 
inequality between men and women remains stark, especially 
when it overlaps or intersects with social identities. This is 
evident not only in pay discrepancy but also in other forms of 
compensation. Such economic inequalities disproportionately 
harm women and their families.
This church expects workers to be paid equitably for similar work. 
There should be no discrepancies in benefits nor in access to capital 
for business or investment. There should be no discrepancies in 
access to Social Security or pensions. Intersecting factors such as 
race, ethnicity, and ability should not worsen the disparities.
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
63
There are various strategies to correct these systemic problems. 
Some stress regulations aimed at equity whereas others 
emphasize market freedom. The primary criteria should be what 
provides sufficient, sustainable livelihood, because the lives of 
providers and their dependents are at stake.
36) Advocate for and support multifaceted understandings of 
social and economic roles so that neither our human traits 
(such as courage or compassion) nor our callings (such as 
business leader or stay-at-home parent) are dictated by our 
sex (biological) and gender. Encourage and empower all 
people to use their gifts for the sake of the common good, 
whether at home, at work, or in the public sphere.
Some people and communities understand gender-assigned roles 
and characteristics to be largely fixed. These roles, often connected 
to the teaching of complementarity, are considered to be immutably 
defined by God or nature. The historical evidence demonstrates that 
many of the injustices and power inequities visited upon women 
have followed from that teaching. However, this church holds that 
roles within social structures are intended for the sake of human 
well-being and are provisional rather than fixed.
As social beings, we humans need social structures and guidance 
for the roles we live out. Social structures and roles are not 
solely social constructions; some aspects of biology influence 
some behavioral tendencies. Yet, the admission of women into 
professions such as law or the military in recent decades, and 
their success in those fields, demonstrate that gender-assigned 
roles are not immutable as once believed.64 Social roles and 
structures require ongoing evaluation in light of God’s intent that 
human community should flourish.65
This church celebrates when women find their places of 
responsibility, whether as heads of a corporation or full-time 
homemakers. Either choice illustrates the calling to contribute 
to society’s good. Men should explore similar variety in the roles 
they seek. Because there are many phases in each person’s life 
journey, we also honor roles that are not compensated, such as 
A Social Statement 
64
retirement or volunteerism. The 
aim is for individuals in community 
to seek the most life-giving roles 
within the structures of church, 
family, work, or civil society.
Toward this end, the ELCA urges 
that society’s laws, policies, and 
practices foster diversity and flexibility so that all may contribute 
their gifts to society, regardless of their gender.
U.S. courts and legislatures today generally support women’s 
vocations outside the home. In addition, this society needs laws 
and policies that will eliminate hidden discrimination, including 
when one becomes pregnant.
37) Advocate for and support resources for families of 
various configurations and the communities in which they 
live. Empower parents and all who raise or care for children 
or other family members to nurture, protect, and provide for 
their households in ways that do not reinforce gender-based 
stereotypes. In particular, advocate for institutional changes 
that support and encourage men and boys to participate in all 
family roles associated with the home, caregiving, parenting, 
and nurturing.
This church continues to affirm the goodness of marriage and 
family but also recognizes that patriarchy has affected these 
relationships in harmful ways. The family is “an indispensable social 
institution because of its role in establishing conditions of trust and 
protection of the vulnerable.”66 We teach that families are formed in 
various configurations; the primary concern is how well they meet 
their intended purpose of helping all family members flourish.
Historically, in this society men have assumed the “headship” 
of their households and women have been expected to be 
subordinate and to fulfill roles with lower social status, such as 
nurturing and caring for others. In justification, Christians in 
the past, and many today, cite the so-called “Household Codes” 
This church celebrates 
when women find their 
places of responsibility, 
whether as heads of a 
corporation or full-time 
homemakers.

65
(Ephesians 5:22-6:9; Colossians 3:18-4:1). Indeed, some point to 
gender-based rules presented as a form of works righteousness (1 
Timothy 2:15).67
By contrast, this church holds 
that God intends the leadership of 
families to be shared in full and 
equitable partnerships, which can 
be arranged in various ways. Social 
science research indicates that 
families and households benefit 
most when roles are adjusted 
according to the personalities and circumstances involved rather 
than fixed according to gender, insisting on the male as sole head 
of the house.68
Such adjustments empower those who raise or care for children 
to share authority and household roles, which allows everyone 
to thrive. Flexibility permits shared responsibility for all caring 
relationships in a household, from infant care to elder care. 
This necessarily means balancing demands of work and income, 
individual strengths and interests, and the particular needs of the 
family or household.
Society’s economic and social arrangements should provide 
generously in support of families. For instance, the one who gives 
birth needs adequate paid leave, but so do other caregivers. Every 
caregiver needs the opportunity to bond with a newborn and, in 
relevant cases, to support a partner’s recovery from labor and 
delivery. U.S. society must find ways to increase paid family leave 
for parents and primary caregivers and to strengthen support 
for child care. Those returning to work after raising children also 
need profession-specific support for reentering the work force.
38) Advocate for and support legal reforms, humane policies, 
and adequate services for migrants, immigrants, refugees, 
and asylum seekers, especially those who experience 
intersecting forms of oppression. (See the ELCA’s social 
message “Immigration,” ELCA.org/socialmessages.) 
God intends the 
leadership of families 
to be shared in full and 
equitable partnerships, 
which can be arranged 
in various ways.
A Social Statement 
66
This statement affirms previous ELCA teaching and policy that 
stress fairness and generosity in responding to newcomers in the 
United States. The ELCA’s commitment to U.S. legal and policy 
reform includes several social-policy resolutions anchored by 
compassion, justice, and wisdom.69 Those resolutions prioritize 
addressing the root causes of mass migration, the unification of 
families, and just, humane enforcement.
Migrants, immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers often suffer 
more when they are women, girls, or gender non-conforming 
people. At every point in their journey, and even when living and 
working in the U.S., they are especially vulnerable to degradation, 
rape, and other forms of violence. Their immigration status must 
not compromise their safety and well-being. On the contrary, their 
status as sojourners in this society invokes biblical injunctions for 
special care and concern (Leviticus 19:34).
39) Advocate for and support portrayals in entertainment, 
media, and advertising that do not objectify or stereotype 
people but rather show all people as capable of the wide 
variety of human characteristics and roles.
The power of entertainment and media to shape individual 
thought and cultural beliefs is immense and often underestimated. 
This church expects that entertainment and media should seek to 
be gender just. The gender-based stereotypes and sexist attitudes 
in film, print, advertisements, and social media are many and 
require serious efforts for reform.
The purpose of entertainment is to provide release and enjoyment, 
while art offers an interpretation of human experience that 
probes our understanding. This church encourages entertainment 
and media decision-makers to portray gender diversity and to 
show that individuals are capable of a wide variety of human 
characteristics and status. Consumers are encouraged to think 
critically about both the production and their own consumption of 
these media. Those who raise or educate children and youth are 
especially encouraged to seek greater media literacy.
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
67
40) Advocate for and support means for increasing women’s 
participation in local, state, and national politics, with special 
attention to the proportionate advocacy and support needed 
by those who face intersecting forms of oppression.
The Lutheran theological heritage teaches that God intends 
governing authorities to serve the good of society. When women 
are underrepresented in this country’s political offices and public 
leadership, the common good and the vocations of women are 
not fully served. This church encourages change in social beliefs 
and attitudes about women that often inform their exclusion from 
political life and public leadership. This church likewise calls for 
mentoring, education, and equitable practices toward political 
leadership, and for services for families and households that enable 
women to serve. Especially acute is the need to encourage and 
support women of color and others in marginalized groups to serve 
in political and leadership roles at local, state, and national levels.
A Shared Challenge: 
Living in hope, we are called to action.
We of the ELCA acknowledge the inspiring and yet challenging 
vision expressed in the rich convictions and significant 
commitments of this statement addressing justice for women 
and girls. We recognize that this requires the difficult and critical 
work of confronting and dismantling patriarchy, sexism, and 
male privilege. We accept this summons with confidence in the 
triune God—revealed in the Scriptures and celebrated in Word and 
Sacrament—who lovingly intends that all people flourish.
We recognize as God’s gifts the society and the church of 
which we are part, even while analysis reveals how patriarchy 
and sexism pervade our lives within them. We give thanks for 
the social advances made in this society against systemic and 
personal harm. Yet we affirm this statement’s convictions and 
commitments as a summons to seek even greater justice and 
equity for all.
A Social Statement 
68
We are grateful that God grants 
us in faith both the freedom and 
the obligation for neighbor justice, 
a commitment to seek equity and 
equality for all. We celebrate the 
Holy Spirit’s work in our church 
and pray she will empower us to 
live in hope and into action, because through Jesus Christ we trust 
that God’s promises ultimately will prevail.

12  This argument is known as an ontological argument based on what sex a 
person is. According to a sex-based understanding of humans, there are two 
kinds of human nature, based strictly on being male or being female. According 
to this idea, humans are particular, fixed beings strictly set by biological sex. 
This idea stands in contrast to a different understanding of humanity (a different

ontological argument), that there is a single “human beingness” (ontology) in 
which everyone shares. Understanding humans from this viewpoint allows for 
the actual diversity of human bodies and characteristics.

Glossary 
Androcentric: Male-centered, focused on men.
Binary (Gender Binary): The concept that there are only two 
genders, man or woman, which are inherently distinct and “opposite.”
Complementary/Complementarity: The belief that God gave 
men and women inherently different roles and purposes that 
complement each other to mutual benefit. Men’s roles have often 
related to leadership and decision-making; women’s roles have 
included obeying males and caring for others. These roles are 
informed by the structural dynamic of dominance (male) and 
submission (female). The imbalance of power in the relationship 
contributes to male privilege.
Domestic violence: See entry for “Gender-based violence.”
Equality: The idea that people have the same rights and should 
receive the same resources. Equality can refer to the equal worth 
of all people or to people having equal experiences of their rights 
and their potential in life.
Equity: Fair treatment of people according to their needs. 
The principle of equity takes into account that people exist on 
inherently uneven playing fields due to poverty, sexism, racism, 
etc. Because of these different contexts, individuals or groups may 
require different resources and support to ensure that they have 
the same rights and abilities to make choices as others do (such 
as having a choice of quality doctors, careers, neighborhoods, 
etc.). The goal of equity is to ensure each person receives what 
each person needs to flourish and is not disadvantaged.
Ex. A simple example of equality in public restrooms would 
be having changing tables in all restrooms, because male 
caregivers may also need a space to change diapers. A simple 
example of equity in public restrooms would be putting more 
stalls in women’s restrooms in order to serve the specific 
needs women have.

75
Expansive language: Language (or imagery) referring to God that 
is not limited to humanity or human categories: water, a rock, a 
hiding place, a mighty fortress, etc. See “inclusive language.”
Gender: Identities, roles, behaviors, and attributes that cultures, 
societies, and individuals shape, most often linked to femininity 
and masculinity. The most common gender identities are woman/
girl and man/boy, but other identities exist. For more, see “gender 
non-conforming.”
Gender identity: How a person understands one’s own gender; 
one’s internal sense of one’s gender.
 
Gender justice: Gender justice is expressed through equality and 
balanced power relations for people of all genders to live into their 
individual callings. Gender justice is sought by eliminating power 
imbalances among people at individual and societal levels, as well 
as eliminating discrimination against women and people who do 
not adhere to stereotypes associated with men and women.
Gender non-conforming, Non-binary, Genderqueer: Words that 
people who do not identify as “men” or “women” use to describe 
their gender (not sexuality). Their gender identity and/or biological 
characteristics may not completely fit with the dominant and 
expected ways of acting as, or being, a man or woman or a boy or 
girl. Each term might be used differently by different people, as 
an umbrella term or as a specific label for their gender identity. 
This document uses all three terms in an effort to be inclusive. 
(Terminology will change over time. Readers are referred to 
contemporary communities for up-to-date language.) For more, 
see “gender,” “intersex,” “transgender,” and “queer.”
Gender-based violence: Physical, sexual, psychological, 
emotional, or other personal harm inflicted on someone for 
gender-based reasons, including but not limited to intimate-
partner violence and domestic violence. This can include such 
things as catcalling women or bullying boys who are not 
perceived as “man enough.” Perpetrators commit gender-based 
violence to assert power over someone.
A Social Statement 
76
Genderqueer: See “Gender non-conforming, Non-binary, 
Genderqueer.”
Hierarchy: A system in which groups are ranked and certain 
groups have power over other groups. Sometimes this power 
over others leads to more value being assigned to the group or 
individuals with dominance.
Human trafficking: Coercion, abduction, and/or imprisonment 
of people for forced labor, often of a sexual nature. This problem 
is pervasive around the world, including in the U.S. Also known as 
modern-day slavery.
Inclusive language: Language that includes all genders when 
referring to humanity or God, for instance, using humans or 
humankind to talk about humanity, rather than man or mankind. 
See “expansive language.”
Intersecting, intersectionality: Humans have multiple aspects 
to their identities, including gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual 
orientation, age, social class, etc. These aspects of human 
identities are tied to systemic privilege and oppression; gender 
is tied to sexism, ethnicity is tied to racism, etc. Intersectionality 
describes the ways different forms of discrimination and systemic 
oppression affect each other and shape the lives of individuals and 
communities in distinct ways. All human identities and all forms 
of privilege and oppression are made up of many intersections.
Ex. A woman of African descent may have a Ph.D. and make 
a healthy salary, but she will still suffer from racism and 
sexism. However, she would experience that racism and 
sexism differently from how a man of African descent, a 
white woman, or an impoverished person might experience 
them. The injustices she faces, therefore, may have solutions 
different from those for other people.
Intersex: As described by the Intersex Society of North America, 
a term for a variety of conditions people are born with: physical 
characteristics, anatomy, and/or genes that vary from standards 
Faith, Sexism, and Justice: A Call to Action
77
set by doctors’ expectations for being “female” or “male.” The term 
refers to the fact of biological variation among humans. Some 
people identify as intersex, rather than using the term solely 
to refer to a condition; others may also identify as gender non-
conforming or a similar term.
Justice: Generally, justice refers to an underlying sense of fairness, 
right treatment, and reciprocity. This statement emphasizes the 
aspects of justice that include fair and equal treatment under 
the law, ending oppression based on power differences, and, as 
emphasized in the Bible, a right relationship with God and within 
community.
Neighbor justice: A term proposed in this social statement that is 
rooted in the biblical directive to “love your neighbor as yourself.” 
This term expresses the idea that faith is active in love and love 
necessarily calls for justice in relationships and in the structures 
of society. Neighbor justice is meeting neighbors’ needs across the 
globe and in our local communities.
Non-binary: See “Gender non-conforming, Non-binary, 
Genderqueer.”
Objectification: Thinking of or portraying people as objects, 
erasing their humanity, emotions, and rights.
Ex. Catcalling, advertisements that use sexualized images to 
sell merchandise, and stories in which female characters exist 
only as props for male characters.
Patriarchy: A social system that enables men to have more power 
than, and power over, women and people who do not conform 
to socially accepted gender roles. A patriarchal social system is 
dominated by men, identified with men, and centered on men’s 
actions, voices, and authority. In various ways, this kind of social 
system operates to control women, girls, and people who do not 
fit society’s predominant ideas of maleness and masculinity.

78
Privilege: This term refers to the relationships between groups 
of people in society, to the social advantage or special treatment 
of a group or persons in a group. This advantage is unearned and 
results from how a group’s identity is perceived as “normal” or 
“better.” Privilege is lived out on an individual and societal scale. 
Privilege is not something a person deliberately opts into or out 
of, nor is it experienced by everyone in the same ways.
Ex. A man benefits from male privilege when his opinion is 
subconsciously valued more highly  in a meeting, when he 
is paid more for equal work, or when he walks down a street 
without harassment or fear of sexual assault. White people 
benefit from white privilege when they can shop without being 
followed or monitored by staff who think they may shoplift, or 
when the majority of heroes in textbooks and movies look like 
them. For a white male, the combination of white privilege and 
male privilege can work together. A white man may have fewer 
risk factors for some stress-related illnesses such as Type 2 
diabetes, while his complaints of pain are more likely to be 
taken seriously by his doctor. For more, see “intersectionality.”
Queer: Umbrella term regarding sex, gender, and sexual 
orientation, often used by individuals who identify as somehow 
“other” from society’s sexual, romantic, or gender norms. 
Although historically used in a derogatory manner, the term has 
since been reclaimed as a positive label by some members within 
that community.
Rape culture: An environment in which the objectification of 
and assault on human bodies, particularly in a sexual way, is 
normalized and tolerated. Rape culture primarily harms women 
and girls. Blaming rape victims for their assaults and maintaining 
a biased justice system are both parts of rape culture and how it 
is propagated.
Reproductive health care: Health services related to the 
reproductive system at all stages of life for all genders, including 
the menstrual cycle, fertility, and cancer.

Sex (biological): A scientific label assigned at birth that describes 
an individual’s reproductive organs and whether they have XX 
chromosomes (female) or XY chromosomes (male). People whose 
biology varies from standards set by doctors’ expectations of 
being “female” or “male” are typically called “intersex.” Biological 
sex characteristics and traits of people who are said to be female 
or male are also variable.
Sexism: Refers to what supports male privilege and reinforces 
prejudice and discrimination against women and girls due to 
their gender and against people who do not conform to socially 
accepted gender roles. Human actions and speech can be sexist, 
as can institutions, policies, and practices.
Sexuality: A complex individual and social concept. Individually, 
sexuality includes the romantic and/or sexual feelings and desires 
that a person experiences. People’s sexuality is also influenced by 
the social and cultural forces in which they find themselves.
Toxic masculinity: Refers to forms of masculinity that 
emphasize aggression, power, and control and sometimes violent 
or unhealthy sexuality. It deemphasizes weakness, caring, and 
vulnerability. Masculinity itself is not harmful; however, it is 
described as toxic when these forms of masculinity cultivate harm 
to self, others, and society. Toxic masculinity limits the humanity 
and compassion of men.
Transgender: Describes a person whose gender is different from 
the sex assigned or identified at birth. Some transgender individuals 
identify as men or as women; others don’t identify with one of 
those words. Some people use this term to describe their identity; 
for others it serves as an umbrella term. Over time its meaning may 
change as language evolves. See “gender non-conforming.”
