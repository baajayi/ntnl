ELCA Teaching
The ELCA confesses the Triune God — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We proclaim Jesus Christ as Lord
and Savior. In our preaching and teaching the ELCA trusts the Gospel as the power of God for the
salvation of all who believe.
ELCA teaching or theology serves the proclamation and ministry of this faith. It does not have an
answer for all questions, not even all religious questions. Teaching or theology prepares members to
be witnesses in speech and in action of God’s rich mercy in Jesus Christ.
Scriptures, Creeds and Confessions
The ELCA’s official Confession of Faith identifies the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments
(commonly called the Bible); the Apostles’, Nicene and Athanasian Creeds; and the Lutheran
confessional writings in the Book of Concord as the basis for our teaching. ELCA congregations make
the same affirmation in their governing documents, and ELCA pastors and deacons promise to carry
out their ministry in accordance with these teaching sources. This Confession of Faith is more than
just words in an official document. Every Sunday in worship ELCA congregations hear God’s word
from the Scriptures, pray as Jesus taught and come to the Lord’s Table expecting to receive the
mercies that the Triune God promises. Throughout the week ELCA members continue to live by faith,
serving others freely and generously in all that they do because they trust God’s promise in the
Gospel. In small groups and at sick beds, in private devotions and in daily work, this faith saturates all
of life.

This connection to all of life is the clearest demonstration of the authority that the canonical
Scriptures, the ecumenical Creeds and the Lutheran Confessions have in the ELCA. The Holy Spirit
uses these witnesses to create, strengthen and sustain faith in Jesus Christ and the life we have in
him. That life-giving work continues every day, as Martin Luther explained in the Small Catechism: the
Holy Spirit “calls, gathers, enlightens and sanctifies the whole Christian church on earth and preserves
it in union with Jesus Christ in the one true faith.”
