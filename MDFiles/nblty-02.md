<p><b>To the Esteemed and Reverend Master
<br>NICHOLAS VON AMSDORF
<br>Licentiate Of holy Scripture and Canon at Wittenberg,
<br>my special and kind friend;
<br>Doctor Martin Luther.</b></p> 

<p>The grace and peace of God be with thee, esteemed and reverend dear sir and 
 friend. </p> 
 
<p>The time to keep silence has passed and the time to (Eccl 3:7) speak is come,  
 as saith Ecclesiastes. I have followed out intention[1] and brought together 
 some matters touching the reform of the Christian Estate, to be laid before 
 the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, in the hope that may deign to 
 help His Church through the efforts of the laity, since the clergy, to whom 
 this task more properly belongs, have grown quite indifferent. I am sending 
 the whole thing to your Reverence, that you may pass judgment on it and, if 
 necessary, improve it. </p>   
 
<p>I know full well that I shall not escape the charge of presumption in that I, 
 a despised monk, venture to address such high and great Estates on matters of 
 such moment, and to give advice to people of such high intelligence. I shall 
 offer no apologies, no matter who may chide me. Perchance I owe my God and 
 the world another pie of folly, and I have now made up my mind honestly to pay 
 that debt, if I can do so, and for once to become court jester; if I fail, I 
 still have one advantage, -- no one need buy me a cap or cut me my comb.[2] It 
 is a question which one will put the bells on the other.[3] I must fulfill the 
 proverb, "Whatever the world does, a monk must be it, even if he has to be 
 painted in."[4] More than once a fool has spoken wisely, and wise men often 
 have been arrant (1 Cor 3:18) fools, as Paul says, "If any one will be wise, 
 let him become a fool." Moreover since I am not only a fool, but also a sworn 
 doctor of Holy Scripture, I am glad for the chant to fulfill my doctor's oath 
 in this fool's way. </p>   
 
<p>I pray you, make my excuses to the moderately intelligent, for I know not 
 how to earn the grace and favor of the immoderately intelligent, though I have 
 often sought to do with great pains. Henceforth I neither desire nor regard 
 their favor. God help us to seek not our own glory, but His alone! Amen. </p>   
 
<p>Wittenberg, in the house of the Augustinians, 
<br> on the Eve of St. John the Baptist (June 23d), 
<br> in the year fifteen hundred and twenty.</p>

<p><b>To His Most Illustrious and Mighty Imperial Majesty, 
<br>and to the Christian Nobility of the German Nation, 
<br>Doctor Martin Luther.</b></p>   
 
<p>Grace and power from God, Most Illustrious Majesty, and most gracious and 
 dear Lords. </p>   
 
<p>It is not out of sheer forwardness or rashness that I, a single, poor man, 
 have undertaken to address your worships. The distress and oppression which 
 weigh down all the Estates of Christendom, especially of Germany, and which 
 move not me alone, but everyone to cry out time and again, and to pray for 
 help,[5] have forced me even now to cry aloud that God may inspire some one 
 with His Spirit to lend this suffering nation a helping hand. Oft times the 
 councils[6] made some presence at reformation, but their attempts have been 
 cleverly hindered by the guile of certain men and things have gone from bad to 
 worse. I now intend, by the help of God, to throw some light upon the wiles 
 and wickedness of these men, to the end that when they are known, they may not 
 henceforth be so hurtful and so great a hindrance. God has given us a noble 
 youth to be our head and thereby has awakened great hopes of good in many 
 hearts;[7] wherefore it is meet that we should do our part and profitably use 
 this time of grace. </p>   
 
<p>In this whole matter the first and most important thing is that we take 
 earnest heed not to enter on it trusting great might or in human reason, even 
 though all power in the world were ours; for God cannot and will not suffer a 
 good work to be begun with trust in our own power or reason. Such works He 
 crushes ruthlessly to earth, as it (Ps. 33:16) is written in the xxiii Psalm, 
 "There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is 
 not delivered by much strength." On this account, I fear, it came to pass of 
 old that the good Emperors Frederick I[8] and II[9] and many other German 
 emperors were shamefully oppressed and trodden under foot by the popes, 
 although all the world feared them. It may be that they relied on own might 
 more than on God, and therefore they had to fall. In our own times, too, what 
 was it that raised the bloodthirsty Julius II[10] to such heights? Nothing 
 else, I fear, except that France, the Germans and Venice relied (Judges 20:21) 
 upon themselves. The children of Benjamin slew 42,000 Israelites[11] because 
 the latter relied on their own strength. </p>   
 
<p>That it may not so fare with us and our noble young Emperor Charles, we must 
 be sure that in this matter are dealing not with men, but with the princes of 
 hell, who can fill the world with war and bloodshed, but whom war and 
 bloodshed do not overcome. We must go at this work despairing of physical 
 force and humbly trusting God; we must seek God's help with earnest prayer, 
 and fix our minds on nothing else than the misery and distress of suffering 
 Christendom, without regard to the deserts of evil men. Otherwise we may 
 start the game with great prospect of success, but when we get well into it 
 the evil spirits will stir up such confusion that the whole world will swim in 
 blood, and yet nothing will come of it. Let us act wisely, therefore, and in 
 the fear of God. The more force we use, the greater our disaster if we do not 
 act humbly and in God's fear. The popes and the Romans have hitherto been 
 able, by the devil's help, to set kings at odds with one another, and they may 
 well be able to do it again, if we proceed by our own might and cunning, 
 without God's help.
