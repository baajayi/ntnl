I.  Introduction                                                                                                                                
        
Invited to answer the question, “Teacher, which commandment in the law 
is the greatest?” Jesus answered, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with 
all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’  This is the 
great and À
 rst commandment.  And a second is like it, ‘You shall love your 
neighbor as yourself.’  On these two commandments hang all the law and 
the prophets” (Matthew 22:36–40).  Christians respond to these commands 
in the conÀ
 dent hope that by God’s grace alone we are set free to worship 
God and love our neighbor.
This social statement addresses the question: how do we understand human 
sexuality within the context of Jesus’ invitation to love God and love our 
neighbor (Romans 13:9–10; Galatians 5:14)?
II.  A distinctly Lutheran approach                                                                               
Our À
 rst response to this question is to remember that, as Lutherans, we are 
the inheritors of a rich theological tradition that assists us in discerning how 
to live faithfully in a complex world.  Our starting point is the foundational 
A Social Statement on
Human Sexuality:
Gift and Trust
This social teaching statement was amended and adopted by a two-thirds 
vote (676-338) by the eleventh biennial Churchwide Assembly on August 
19, 2009, at Minneapolis, Minnesota.
Lutheran understanding that we read and understand the Bible in light of 
the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  This “good news” 
of the Gospel that we are freed from captivity to sin (justiÀ
 cation by grace 
through faith on account of Christ) allows us to respond to God’s mercy 
through love for and service to the neighbor1 (our vocation in the world). 
As Lutherans, understanding that God’s promised future is the transforma-
tion of the whole creation, we believe that the Triune God, Father, Son and 
Holy Spirit, is engaged deeply and relationally in the continuing creation 
of the world.  We anticipate and live out the values of this promised future 
concretely in the present.  It is therefore in the midst of daily life in the 
world that we are given the vocational task of serving the neighbor.
Central to our vocation, in relation to human sexuality, is the building and 
protection of trust2 in relationships.  As justiÀ
 ed and forgiven sinners, our 
efforts to create trust are in response to God’s faithful (trustworthy) rela-
tionship of love for the world in Christ.  We are called therefore to be trust-
worthy in our human sexuality and to build social institutions and practices 
where trust and trustworthy relationships can thrive.
Justifi
 ed by grace through faith
As Lutherans, we believe that we are justiÀ
 ed by grace through faith.  The 
Lutheran Confessions guide us in our understanding of justiÀ
 cation by 
identifying three intersecting afÀ
 rmations: solus Christus, sola gratia, and sola 
À
 de (Christ alone, grace alone, and by faith alone).3  Deeply grounded in 
Scripture, understood as the living Word of God, these together proclaim 
Jesus Christ as central to the Gospel:
Solus Christus
• 
 (Christ alone) insists that the purpose of Scripture is 
to reveal Jesus Christ as the Savior of the world. Scripture is to be 
interpreted through the lens of Christ’s death and resurrection for 
the salvation of all.
Sola gratia
• 
 (grace alone) afÀ
 rms that we are saved by grace alone. 
As with solus Christus, sola gratia means that there is nothing a 
person can do through his or her action that will create a right 
relationship with God. Only God’s grace can do that.
Sola À
 de
• 
 (by faith alone) afÀ
 rms that, through the hearing of God’s 
Word, the Holy Spirit ignites faith (trust) in God within us.
A Social Statement
2
These three emphases also tell us that sin does not have to do simply with 
the keeping or breaking of rules or laws.  Rather, we sin when we turn away 
from God and look to ourselves. Sin turns us toward obsessive self-con-
cern, with disastrous consequences for ourselves and others.
We live therefore within the paradox that in our sexuality, as in other aspects 
of life, we always encounter both our own sinfulness and God’s grace.  It is 
only through Christ that we can turn in faith to trust God, which leads im-
mediately to our baptismal vocation to love and serve the neighbor.
Christian freedom in service of the neighbor
Lutherans are not reluctant to live conÀ
 dently within the difÀ
 cult, com-
plex, and ambiguous realities of daily life. Lutherans understand that active 
engagement in the world is integral to Christian identity.  They are able to 
remain secure in Christ in the midst of the confusions, lack of clarity, and 
struggle that God’s calling entails.  “Did we in our own strength conÀ
 de,” 
sang Luther, “our striving would be losing.” In Christ, “God is making his 
appeal through us” (2 Corinthians 5:20; 1 Peter 4:11).  Lutheran theology 
prepares us precisely to hold in creative tension the paradoxes and com-
plexities of the human situation.  This is also the case with regard to human 
sexuality.  God has created human beings as part of the whole creation and 
with the intention that we live actively in the world (Romans 12–13; Ephe-
sians 5–6).
In his letter to the Galatians, Paul testiÀ
 es that the foundation of Chris-
tian identity is what God has done for us through Christ (Galatians 2:20; 
3:24–28).  Luther echoes this afÀ
 rmation in his treatise, The Freedom of  the 
Christian, claiming that Christians are at one and the same time radically 
freed by the Gospel and called to serve the good of the neighbor:
A Christian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none.
A Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all.4 
Luther believed that these two afÀ
 rmations were the key to understanding 
the entirety of Christian life in the world. Following Paul, he understood 
freedom to be the basis for Christian life and ethics.5   Luther believed 
that this understanding of Christian freedom Á
 owed from the doctrine of 
justiÀ
 cation as that which “preserves and guides all churchly teaching and 
establishes our consciences before God.”6 
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
3
In other words, because we are radically freed in Christ, we are called in that 
freedom to love and serve our neighbor as Christ loved and served us (Ga-
latians 5:1, 13).  Only in the freedom from preoccupation with the self and 
the burden of unworthiness before the perfection of God’s law can such 
concern for the neighbor become possible.
The Lutheran theological understanding of God’s salvation and our ut-
ter dependence on God’s grace, grounded as it is in Scripture (Romans 
3:21–26; Ephesians 2:8–10), has crucial implications for Christian ethics and 
discernment:  
• In emphasizing that salvation is not a reward for morally approved   
 behavior, Lutheran theology teaches that salvation is by God’s grace  
 alone and not dependent upon human action.  We receive in trust,   
 as Paul declares, “the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus   
 Christ for all who believe” (Romans 3:21–22).
• JustiÀ
 ed by faith, Lutherans understand that, because of God’s  
 
 gift, their freedom in Christ leads to a vocation of responsible and   
 humble service to the neighbor (Romans 13:8–10).
• Our vocation of service leads us to live out our responsibilities  
 
 primarily in light of and in response to the neighbor’s needs, often   
 in complex and sometimes tragic situations.
• God’s mercy and compassion instill in us the capacity to empathize   
 with others as “the love of Christ urges us on” (2 Corinthians 5:14).   
 They teach us to walk with each other in joy, humility, and tender  
 
 care.
• The love of God and neighbor, fulÀ
 lled by faith alone, are the two   
 commandments by which Christ taught us to measure and interpret
 every other commandment in Scripture (Matthew 22:36–40).
God’s continuing creation
Christians believe that God is the creator of all that is and that this ongoing 
handiwork is good, good, and very good! (Genesis 1:31).  Both narratives 
of God’s creative activity in the book of Genesis (Genesis 1 and 2) reveal 
God’s goodness and desire for close relationship with human beings as 
integral to the ongoing handiwork of creation.  In Genesis 1, this desire 
is expressed in humanity’s creation—male and female—in the image of 
God.  In Genesis 2, that close relationship is revealed as God scoops up 
and breathes life into earth to form humankind.  As a mark of personal 
conÀ
 dence, the Creator even entrusts to human beings the task of naming 
A Social Statement

and tending the inhabitants of the earth God so clearly loves.  The 
tender love and goodness of God’s creative activity includes sexuality and 
gendered bodies (Genesis 2:23–25).
Just as both creation narratives reveal how God intends a relationship of 
trust with humanity, so also the creation of male and female (Genesis 1) 
and the companionship of Adam and Eve (Genesis 2) reveal that human 
beings are created for trusting relationships with each other.  In these 
narratives of God’s creative activity, we understand from the beginning that 
love and trust are at the heart of God’s relationship with human beings.  
We also understand that creation is God’s ongoing activity and not yet 
complete.
The biblical narratives also depict how people violate God’s trust, turn-
ing away from God (Genesis 3).  They want to be like God.  They make 
excuses and apportion blame.  They hide from God.  They cover their 
nakedness.  The full breakdown of relationship enters, complete with curses 
and exile, as depicted in the betrayal of brother against brother (Genesis 4).  
The relationship of trust with God and each other, entailed in the image of 
God, is broken.  People sin; that is, human beings resist their own God-
given identity and destiny.
Nevertheless, God remains faithful, seeking out and inviting all into inti-
mate relationship as sons and daughters.  This dignity of the human being 
reÁ
 ects God’s deep love and stands against all forms of violence, discrimi-
nation, and injustice. Scripture reveals to believers that just as God does not 
abandon that which God loves, neither should we.
We recognize, therefore, our need for God’s law to order and preserve the 
world, expose our sins, and to show us the depth of our capacity to turn 
away from God and neighbor.
And yet we are consoled and encouraged because, even in the face of 
broken trust, God includes all of creation in the unfolding of the human 
community and the world.  As human beings, we participate in creation’s 
work that continues even now in fruitfulness and productivity.7 
For believers, it is hope in God’s future, not in an idealized past,8 that 
inspires participation in God’s changing, open, and inexhaustible creation.  
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
5
Christians believe that God’s promised future includes the transformation 
of the whole creation (Romans 8:19–25).  Guided by this vision, Christians 
anticipate and live out the values of God’s promised future concretely in the 
present.
Through the saving work of Jesus Christ, we understand how Scripture ulti-
mately is future-oriented and À
 lled with promise; creation is fulÀ
 lled in new 
creation (2 Corinthians 5:17; Revelation 21:1–5; 2 Corinthians 3:18; Isaiah 
43:16–21).  Even now, by the power of the Holy Spirit, our lives may reÁ
 ect 
the love of Christ cruciÀ
 ed and risen.  “The life I now live in the Á
 esh,” 
declares Paul, “I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave 
himself for me” (Galatians 2:20). Thus, Christ-like love for the neighbor in-
forms all our activities, sexual and otherwise, now and into God’s future.  In 
anticipation of that future, the ethics of sexuality is thus not purely a per-
sonal matter, but one that affects the witness of the Christian community 
and the well-being of the larger community (1 Corinthians 6:19; Galatians 
6:10; Revelation 21:8).
God’s law at work in the world
As Lutherans, we believe that God has given the law not only to reveal sin 
and order society (1 Timothy 1:9), but also to point us to God’s intentions 
and promises for our lives. 
Luther described two functions of the law, one theological and the other 
political or civil.9  The theological use of the law reveals sin, confronting 
us when we have broken our relationship with God and driving us to the 
forgiveness offered in the Gospel.  When the law forces us to examine the 
extent to which we are ensnared—individually and collectively—in patterns 
of self-serving, exploitation, abuse, and shame, we experience the power 
of the theological use of the law in revealing to us the brokenness of our 
relationship with God. Knowing that we can do nothing to bring about 
our own salvation, Lutherans reject the notion that we can perfect either 
ourselves or society.
The civil use of the law, at the same time, provides order in society to sup-
port the maintenance of peace and justice in this imperfect world.  The 
function of the civil law is, in a sinful world, to protect from harm all those 
whom God loves, particularly the most vulnerable.10 
A Social Statement
6
Lutherans understand that God’s law, in its civil use, permeates and under-
girds basic structures of human society to support life and protect all peo-
ple in a world that remains under the sway of sin.  Such social structures,11  
as the Lutheran Confessions identify them, include ministry, marriage and 
family, civil authority, and daily work.12  Because these structures are tem-
poral, anticipating the arrival of God’s promised future, they must respond 
continually to human needs for protection and Á
 ourishing.
The Ten Commandments
When asked to summarize what God requires in the law, most Christians 
will turn À
 rst to the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:1–17) as God’s guide 
for their own behavior and that of others.  What is distinctive about these 
commandments for Lutherans is that we understand them in light of faith, 
which confesses God as creator and redeemer of the world.  Thus, in ad-
dition to revealing human sin, they constrain wrong behavior and point the 
way for us to serve the neighbor and care for the world.
The À
 rst three commandments together point to our need as sinful hu-
man beings “to fear, love, and trust in God above all things.”  The remain-
ing seven describe our responsibility to serve the neighbor, especially the 
most vulnerable.  They identify those actions that violate trust and destroy 
relationships between people and within community.  They also instruct us 
how to protect and nurture relationships and build up the community: to 
honor those wielding legitimate authority (fourth); preserve and enhance 
life (À
 fth); support boundaries, decency, and faithfulness in sexual relations 
(sixth); prevent exploitation (seventh); and put the best construction on the 
actions of all (eighth).
The ninth and tenth commandments “fence the heart.”  They show us that 
not only individual acts but also thoughts, words, and legal actions done for 
base motives are wrong, and they invite us to right action.  All these things 
honor God by loving the neighbor.
The sixth commandment relates in a particular way to human sexuality.  To 
this end, as Luther wrote in the Small Catechism, “We are to fear and love 
God so that we lead pure and decent lives in word and deed, and each of us 
loves and honors his or her spouse.”13
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
7
When this commandment is violated, many things are adulterated—
relationships are damaged, people are betrayed and harmed.  Promiscuity 
and sexual activity without a spirit of mutuality and commitment are sinful 
because of their destructive consequences for individuals, relationships, and 
the community.  The Apostle Paul’s list of vices (e.g., fornication, impurity, 
licentiousness, idolatry) warns believers of the dangers of gratifying “the 
desires of the Á
 esh,” thereby turning away from belonging to Christ and 
God’s kingdom (Galatians 5:19–21).  The breakdown of trust through the 
sexual adulteration of the bonds of the committed, intimate, and protected 
relationship of marriage wreaks havoc for the family and the community, as 
well as for the people involved.
When this commandment is kept, however, care and attention are given to 
all aspects of life and behavior, including sexuality, which creates marriage 
relationships and practices of trust.  “There is no law against such things,” 
declares Paul, because “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faith-
fulness, gentleness, and self-control” are the “fruit of the Spirit” (Galatians 
5:22–26).
We are called to participate in God’s continuing creation as people who seek 
to fear, love, and trust in God above all things.  As such, we strive to lead 
lives that uphold relationships and a social order where human beings can 
thrive and to support one another in those endeavors.  As sinners justiÀ
 ed 
through the Gospel, we are able to receive creation fully as gift so that we 
can serve our neighbor in need freely.
Our vocation to serve the neighbor
We do not live in private worlds without thought or consideration for his-
toric events or the impact of our actions on individuals, the community, or 
the environment.  Rather, the responsibility to serve the neighbor through 
our daily callings seeks to shape human relationships and a world commu-
nity that honors God and anticipates God’s future transformation of all of 
creation.  In so doing, all people, in whatever situation they À
 nd themselves, 
are called to promote actively the good of the neighbor.
We recognize the complex and varied situations people have relative to hu-
man sexuality: being in relationships, being single, being a friend, living in a 
young or aging body, being male or female, being young or old, or having 
A Social Statement
8
different sexual orientations and gender identities.  In whatever the situa-
tion, all people are called to build trust in relationships and in the commu-
nity.
The way we live out these callings, of course, will be Á
 awed and imperfect.  
As forgiven sinners, we recognize through faith that our imperfect lives 
are means by which God cares for and sustains creation.  We can live both 
humbly and boldly, knowing that our efforts are still infused with God’s 
love and blessing for ourselves, our neighbors, and the world.  By the mercy 
of God, in the midst of evil, betrayal, brokenness, loneliness, and loss, we 
dare to believe that opportunities do open, forgiveness is sought and ten-
dered, good may be rescued, and trust can be restored.
Lutheran social ethics
Lutherans understand human sexuality, and ethics in general, to be part 
of God’s rule in this world, in contrast to God’s rule in the coming world 
through the Gospel.  “We know,” declares Paul, “that the whole creation 
has been groaning in labor pains until now; and not only the creation, but 
we ourselves, who have the À
 rst fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while 
we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies” (Romans 8:22–23).  
Therefore, we believe that the way we order our lives in matters of human 
sexuality is important to faithful living, but is not central to determining 
our salvation.  We are able to be realistic and merciful with respect to our 
physical and emotional realities, not striving for angelic perfection as if our 
salvation were at stake.  Even marriage is an earthly blessing on this side of 
heaven (Matthew 22:30).14 
A Lutheran approach to ethics makes use of Martin Luther’s understanding 
of the two realms of God’s action.15  With the left hand (worldly realm), 
God rules in this world, maintaining order and restraining evil through the 
law and reason.  With the right hand (spiritual realm), God brings in the 
coming world of Christ’s rule where sin, death, and evil will reign no longer. 
 
This new world is experienced by faith alone, most clearly when God an-
nounces in Word and sacraments the forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation.
Set free by the death and resurrection of Christ (the spiritual realm), Chris-
tians are sent back into this created world, which is experienced no longer 
as a threat, but as God’s gift.  There we are called to love and serve the neigh-
bor and to uphold and promote human community and the preservation
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
9
of creation.  This is work we undertake not only with other Christians, but 
together with all people of good will.
As we determine how to love and serve the neighbor in a complex world, 
Lutherans rely on Scripture.  We also are guided by the Lutheran Confes-
sions, and we bring to this task a particular appreciation for the gifts of 
knowledge and learning.  We believe that God also provides insights to us 
through reason, imagination, the social and physical sciences, cultural un-
derstanding, and the creative arts (Philippians 4:8).  One reason Lutherans 
have engaged so deeply in education and research is that we believe God 
works through such means to guide us in reading Scripture and in under-
standing how we will live in a world of continuing complexity and change.16 
Thus, we recognize that this church’s deliberations related to human sexual-
ity require our best moral discernment and practical wisdom in the worldly 
realm, even though these matters are not central to determining our salva-
tion.  We also understand that in this realm faithful people can and some-
times will come to different conclusions about what constitutes responsible 
action.  Therefore, this social statement seeks to assist this church in dis-
cerning what best serves the neighbor in the complexity of human relation-
ships and social needs in the midst of daily life.
III.  Trust and human sexuality                                                                                       
God loves human life so much that “the Word became Á
 esh” (John 1:14).  
We know, therefore, that God’s love embraces us totally, including our sexu-
ality.  We also know that God created each of us not only as individuals, but 
also as people who live in a variety of social communities and contexts.  In 
response to God’s love for us, we seek life-giving relationships with others 
and create social structures and practices that support such relationships.
The complexity of human sexuality
God created human beings to be in relationship with each other and con-
tinually blesses us with diverse powers, which we use in living out those 
relationships.  These include powers for action, reasoning, imagination, and 
creativity. 
Sexuality especially involves the powers or capacities to form deep and last-
ing bonds, to give and receive pleasure, and to conceive and bear children.  
17
A Social Statement
10
Sexuality can be integral to the desire to commit oneself to life with an-
other, to touch and be touched, and to love and be loved.  Such powers are 
complex and ambiguous.  They can be used well or badly.  They can bring 
astonishing joy and delight.  Such powers can serve God and serve the 
neighbor.  They also can hurt self or hurt the neighbor.  Sexuality À
 nds 
expression at the extreme ends of human experience: in love, care, and 
security, or lust, cold indifference, and exploitation.
Sexuality consists of a rich and diverse combination of relational, emo-
tional, and physical interactions and possibilities.  It surely does not con-
sist solely of erotic desire. Erotic desire, in the narrow sense, is only one 
component of the relational bonds that humans crave as sexual beings. 
Although not all relationships are sexual, at some level most sexual relation-
ships are about companionship.  Although some people may remain single, 
either intentionally or unintentionally, all people need and delight in com-
panionship, and all are vulnerable to loneliness. 
The need to share our lives with others is a profound good (Genesis 2:18).  
The counsel to love and care for the neighbor is not a command that is 
foreign to our created natures; rather, reaching out in love and care is part 
of who we are as relational and sexual beings.  Even if we never have sexual 
intimacy, we all seek and respond to the bonds and needs of relationships.
Sexual love—the complex interplay of longing, erotic attraction, self-
giving, and receiving deÀ
 ned by trust—is a wondrous gift.  The longing for 
connection, however, also can render human beings susceptible to pain, 
isolation, and harm. The desire for sexual love, therefore, does not by itself 
constitute a moral justiÀ
 cation for sexual behavior.  Giving and receiving 
love always involves mixed motives and limited understanding of individual 
and communal consequences.
The sharing of love and sexual intimacy within the mutuality of a mature 
and trusting relationship can be a rich source of romance, delight, creativity, 
imagination, restraint, desire, pleasure, safety, and deep contentment that 
provides the context for individuals, family, and the community to thrive.
Though sexual love remains God’s good gift, sin permeates human sexu-
ality as it does all of life.  When expressed immaturely, irresponsibly, or 
with hurtful intent, then love—or its counterfeit, coercive power—can 
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
11
lead to harm and even death.  Too often lust is mistaken for love, which in 
turn becomes the rationale for selÀ
 sh behaviors.  When infatuation, lust, 
and self-gratiÀ
 cation take the place of the responsibilities of love, cascading 
consequences result that can be devastating for partners, children, families, 
and society.
In recognizing the many ways in which people misuse power and love, we 
need to be honest about sin and the À
 nite limitations of human beings.  We 
also recognize the complexity of the human and societal forces that drive the 
desire for companionship, for intimate relation with another, for belonging, 
and for worth.  The deep interconnectedness of the body with the mind and 
spirit suggests the complexity of such situations.  The biblical narratives both 
rejoice in the splendor of sexual attraction (Song of Songs 4) and are candid 
about the harm that can result from human sexuality (2 Samuel 11, 13; Mat-
thew 5:27–30).
Social trust and the common good
Trust is a critical element that holds together couples and relationships, 
households and families, social structures and institutions.  We normally relate 
concepts of trust, promise, loyalty, and reliance to individual relationships.  
These concepts, however, also describe economic life, political arrangements, 
social policies, and social structures. Contemporary social scientists call atten-
tion to these almost invisible bonds of trust and reliance that are necessary 
for a well-functioning society.18  They are beginning to articulate what close-
knit communities have long known: social trust undergirds healthy societies.
 
Trust is essential for the good of society.  This is true in general terms for 
the proper functioning of communities and pertains especially to the social 
practices and institutions that affect and are affected by human sexuality.  The 
development of social trust must be a central concern for all who seek the 
good of the neighbor in the pursuit of justice and the common good.  Lu-
therans understand that social structures cannot create faith, hope, and love, 
but they trust that God does bless and provide appropriate gifts through such 
structures and, in some cases, in spite of them.
The concept of social trust has long been central to both Jewish and Chris-
tian social and political thought through the focus on the common good and 
the need of the neighbor.  As the Apostle Paul writes, “So then, whenever we 
have an opportunity, let us work for the good of all . . .” (Galatians 6:10).19 
A Social Statement
12
When human beings serve their neighbor rather than themselves, they are 
acting in ways that enhance social trust. However, the challenge of estab-
lishing, maintaining, and fostering social trust involves more than private 
actions.  It also requires shaping legal, commercial, technological, and civic 
structures for the common good.  Examples include the social institutions 
of the family, the conduct of commerce, laws enacted and enforced by 
government, and community standards.  A justice-oriented legal code, social 
contracts and institutions that protect the weak and most vulnerable, and 
the protection of human rights all illustrate the kinds of things that can 
contribute to and support social trust.20 
Social trust is grounded in the practice of mutual respect for the dignity of 
all people and their consciences.  Strong communities ensure social trust 
when they provide social support for disagreement and dissent, and nurture 
the values of mutual respect and regard for the opinions of others.  Within 
the church community, we contribute to respect for the understandings 
and experiences of others by living out the eighth commandment: “We do 
not tell lies about our neighbors, betray or slander them, or destroy their 
reputations. Instead we . . . come to their defense, speak well of them, and 
interpret everything they do in the best possible light.”21
 
As this church and its members engage the changes and challenges of 
contemporary society related to human sexuality, careful thought must be 
given to which changes enhance and which erode social trust.  The develop-
ment of social trust must be a central concern for Christians who seek the 
good of the neighbor in the pursuit of justice and the common good.  This 
church must be a leader in refocusing attention on practices and attitudes 
that build social trust.  Likewise, it must contribute to the development 
of responsible economic and social policies and practices that shape the 
expression of sexuality within social life.
Human sexuality and our calling to establish trust
Sexual relationships may be among our most profoundly intimate, crucial, 
and self-giving expressions of trust.  Here our human lives are vulnerable to 
joy and delight and to hurt and exploitation.  From spiritual intimacy with 
God to the closest physical intimacy with another, relationships Á
 ourish
according to the depth and trustworthiness of commitments.  In the arena of 
human sexuality, no human relationships can thrive in the absence of trust. 
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
13
Human beings learn about trust from God.  When the Lutheran Confes-
sions discuss faith in God, they understand it fundamentally as trust22 or 
absolute conÀ
 dence in God.  In faith nurtured by the Holy Spirit through 
Word and sacrament, we entrust our whole lives to God.  We experience 
God’s unfailing trustworthiness in God’s relationship with us through the 
Gospel and through God’s deep mercy and compassion in response to our 
human frailty.  In response, as forgiven and justiÀ
 ed people, we seek to 
respond to God’s love for us through care for the neighbor, fostering trust 
in order that individuals and society might Á
 ourish.
What, then, does trust in relation to human sexuality look like when under-
stood in terms of service to the neighbor?  In responding to this question, 
we reÁ
 ect on God’s love for and continuing involvement in creation and on 
the saving action of Jesus Christ for the salvation of the world.  We look to 
Scripture, to the Lutheran Confessions, to the social and physical sciences, 
and to human reason, mercy, and compassion.  In so doing, we boldly but 
humbly afÀ
 rm that trustworthy relationships and social structures will:
• promote, value, and respect the human dignity of each indi 
vidual;
• protect all from physical, emotional, and spiritual harm;
• demonstrate mercy, compassion, and justice for all, especially 
the “least of these”—those who are most vulnerable in relation-
ships and in society;
• ensure accountability and responsibility in relationships and the 
community;
• promote the welfare of individuals and the common good of 
society; and
• value the security and protection afforded through the making 
of promises, including social and contractual commitments.
These foundational and protective conditions provide the necessary context 
and support for trusting relationships that are:
• loving, that include and reÁ
 ect an abundance of agape (unlimited 
love, forgiveness, compassion, care, and concern), eros (passion, 
excitement, and joy), and philia (care for the neighbor);
• life-giving, where afÀ
 rmation is mutually shared, encouragement 
 
is given and received, and individual talents are nurtured and 
supported;
• self-giving in the face of both opportunities and challenges;

fulÀ
 lling, that is, a place where a spirit of joy and an atmosphere 
• 
of peace prevails;
nurturing of physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being;
• 
marked by truth-telling and honesty;
• 
faithful in word and deed, including sexual À
 delity;
•

 cult as well

IV.  Sexuality and social structures that enhance social trust                        
Lutherans believe that God works through social structures for the good 
of society.  The Lutheran Confessions identify marriage and the family as 
foundational structures that support human community.
Marriage: shelter and context for trust
Trust is a quality of relationship that, while never perfected, is nurtured 
and reinforced over time.  The trust and mutuality afforded by marriage 
can make marriage one of the most beautiful, abiding, and transformative 
forms of human relationship.  Depth of care, matched to an intimacy of 
touch, creates relationships much stronger than simple and momentary 
erotic interest.  Sexual intimacy, together with promises of À
 delity and pub-
lic accountability, nurtures bonds that allow people to thrive and provides a 
rich context for the care and support of children.
Marriage is a covenant of mutual promises, commitment, and hope autho-
rized legally by the state and blessed by God.  The historic Christian tradi-
tion and the Lutheran Confessions have recognized marriage as a covenant 
between a man and a woman, reÁ
 ecting Mark 10: 6–9: “But from the begin-
ning of creation, God made them male and female.  For this reason a man 
shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall 
become one Á
 esh.  So they are no longer two, but one Á
 esh.  Therefore 
what God has joined together, let no one put asunder.”  (Jesus here recalls 
Genesis 1:27; 2:23–24.) (see Addendum)
Lutherans long have afÀ
 rmed that the public accountability of marriage, as 
expressed through a legal contract, provides the necessary social support 
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
15
and social trust for relationships that are intended to be sustained through-
out life and within changing and often challenging life situations.  In this 
country, pastors carry both legal and religious responsibilities for marriage.  
In carrying out these responsibilities, pastors hold and exercise pastoral 
discretion for the decision to marry in the church.  In the community of 
the church they preside over the mutual promises made between a couple 
seeking the lifelong, monogamous, and faithful relationship of marriage.  
Marriage requires constant care and cultivation.  It is intended to protect 
the creation and nurturing of mutual trust and love as one foundation of 
human community.  It is a binding relationship that provides conditions for 
personal well-being, the Á
 ourishing of the partner, and the possibility of 
procreation and the nurturing of children.  It also is intended to be a bless-
ing to the community and the world.  Because of promises of À
 delity and 
public accountability, marriage provides a context of love, trust, honesty, 
and commitment within which a couple can express the profound joy of 
relationship as well as address the troubles they encounter throughout life.
Christians believe that marriage is not solely to legitimate physical sexual 
intimacy but to support long-term and durable communion for the good of 
others.23   It is a communion within which the play and delight of physical 
love are crucial expressions of the depth of trust and in which lovemaking 
can be a tender and generous act of self-giving that tends to the joy and 
pleasure of the other.
The public character of marriage also implies a civil responsibility.  Mar-
riage is intended not only to protect the people who are married, but to 
signal to the community their intention to live a peaceful and mutually 
fulÀ
 lling life, even as they endeavor to strengthen the community in which 
they live. The public promises of marriage between a man and a woman, 
therefore, also protect the community by holding people accountable to 
their vows.  Fidelity to promises blesses all who depend on this trust within 
and beyond the marriage.
The Christian commitment to marriage recognizes that sin enters all rela-
tionships, both within and outside the institution of marriage.  All marriag-
es fall short of intentions, and difÀ
 culties are inevitable, both because of 
the different needs and desires of the two individuals and because of sin, 
which places the anxious concern for self before the needs of the other.  
A Social Statement
16
InÀ
 delity to marriage promises betrays the intimate trust of the partner, the 
security of the family, and the public trust of the community.
Precisely because marriage is the place where deep human trust and needs 
abide, it also can be a place of great harm. Many experience neither love 
nor trust within marriage. Harming another emotionally, physically, or spiri-
tually, including through the misuse or abuse of power, is a profound injury. 
 
It also is a betrayal and violation of the shelter and trust that are intended 
within the marriage relationship. Particular care must be taken to support 
and À
 nd safe haven for all who are at risk within a marriage.  This includes 
those whose sense of self is destroyed or damaged within the marriage 
relationship and, therefore, whose ability to act or advocate for their own 
health and safety may be inhibited or lost.
This church recognizes that in some situations the trust upon which mar-
riage is built becomes so deeply damaged or is so deeply Á
 awed that the 
marriage itself must come to a legal end (Matthew 19:3–12).  This church 
does not treat divorce lightly nor does it disregard the responsibilities of 
marriage.  However, in such situations, it provides support to the people 
involved and all who are affected.  Divorced individuals are encouraged to 
avail themselves of pastoral care, to be assured of God’s presence, forgive-
ness, and healing, and to remain in the communion of the church, recogniz-
ing the all-encompassing mercy of God.
This church will provide supportive pastoral care to those who are divorced. 
Further, it believes that those who wish to remarry may gain wisdom from 
the past and may be assured of the Gospel’s freedom, in the midst of bro-
kenness and forgiveness, to enter into their new responsibilities in joy and 
hope.  This church will tend pastorally to the special concerns of blended 
families, to children of divorced parents, and to the particular tensions that 
may accompany family breakdown and transition.
Despite its awareness of the presence of sin and failure in marriage, the 
Christian tradition places great emphasis on the value of marriage for a 
husband and wife.  It is in marriage that the highest degrees of physical 
intimacy are matched with and protected by the highest levels of binding 
commitment, including legal protection.  It is in marriage that public prom-
ises of lifetime commitment can create the foundation for trust, intimacy, 
and safety.
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
17
Both the couple’s intent in their lifelong promises and the civil require-
ments for marriage are important.  Mutual promises of enduring care and 
À
 delity, made before God, allow a couple to open themselves to each other.  
They permit the sharing of profound and tender affection as well as deep 
vulnerabilities and anxieties.  The legal contract creates a public arrange-
ment within which a couple may safely and equitably share their assets and 
resources, arrive at joint decisions, anticipate children, protect and nurture 
them, and plan for a shared future.
The church’s historical experience supports its conÀ
 dence that solemn 
promises, made before a company of witnesses who ask for God’s bless-
ing on a man and a woman, have the power to create a unique framework 
within which two people, a new family, and the community may thrive.  
Consistent with that experience, this church has conÀ
 dence that such 
promises, supported by the contractual framework of civil law, can create a 
lifetime relationship of commitment and cooperation.
Recognizing that this conclusion differs from the historic Christian tradi-
tion and the Lutheran Confessions, some people, though not all, in this 
church and within the larger Christian community, conclude that marriage 
is also the appropriate term to use in describing similar beneÀ
 ts, protection, 
and support for same-gender couples entering into lifelong, monogamous 
relationships.  They believe that such accountable relationships also provide 
the necessary foundation that supports trust and familial and community 
thriving.  Other contractual agreements, such as civil unions, also seek to 
provide some of these protections and to hold those involved in such rela-
tionships accountable to one another and to society.
Lifelong, monogamous, same-gender relationships
Within the last decades, this church has begun to understand and experi-
ence in new ways the need of same-gender-oriented individuals to seek 
relationships of lifelong companionship and commitment as well as public 
accountability and legal support for those commitments.  At the same time, 
public debates and deliberations have continued regarding understandings 
of human sexuality in medicine, social science, and corresponding public 
policy about same-gender relationships.
We in the ELCA recognize that many of our sisters and brothers in same-
gender relationships sincerely desire the support of other Christians for 
A Social Statement
18
living faithfully in all aspects of their lives, including their sexual À
 delity.  In 
response, we have drawn deeply on our Lutheran theological heritage and 
Scripture.  This has led, however, to differing and conscience-bound under-
standings about the place of such relationships within the Christian com-
munity.  We have come to various conclusions concerning how to regard 
lifelong, monogamous, same-gender relationships, including whether and 
how to recognize publicly their lifelong commitments.
While Lutherans hold various convictions regarding lifelong, monogamous, 
same-gender relationships, this church is united on many critical issues.24  It 
opposes all forms of verbal or physical harassment and assault based on 
sexual orientation.  It supports legislation and policies to protect civil rights 
and to prohibit discrimination in housing, employment, and public services.  
It has called upon congregations and members to welcome, care for, and 
support same-gender couples and their families and to advocate for their 
legal protection.
The ELCA recognizes that it has a pastoral responsibility to all children of 
God.  This includes a pastoral responsibility to those who are same-gender 
in their orientation and to those who are seeking counsel about their sexual 
self-understanding. All are encouraged to avail themselves of the means of 
grace and pastoral care.
 
This church also acknowledges that consensus does not exist concerning 
how to regard same-gender committed relationships, even after many years 
of thoughtful, respectful, and faithful study and conversation.  We do not 
have agreement on whether this church should honor these relationships and 
uplift, shelter, and protect them or on precisely how it is appropriate to do so.
In response, this church draws on the foundational Lutheran understanding 
that the baptized are called to discern God’s love in service to the neighbor.  
In our Christian freedom, we therefore seek responsible actions that serve 
others and do so with humility and deep respect for the conscience-bound 
beliefs of others.  We understand that, in this discernment about ethics and 
church practice, faithful people can and will come to different conclusions 
about the meaning of Scripture25 and about what constitutes responsible 
action.  We further believe that this church, on the basis of “the bound 
conscience,”26  will include these different understandings and practices 
within its life as it seeks to live out its mission and ministry in the world. 
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust

This church recognizes that, with conviction and integrity:
On the basis of conscience-bound belief, some are convinced 
• 
that same-gender sexual behavior is sinful, contrary to biblical 
teaching and their understanding of natural law.  They believe 
same-gender sexual behavior carries the grave danger of unre-
pentant sin.  They therefore conclude that the neighbor and the 
community are best served by calling people in same-gender 
sexual relationships to repentance for that behavior and to a 
celibate lifestyle.  Such decisions are intended to be accompa-
nied by pastoral response and community support.
On the basis of conscience-bound belief, some are convinced 
• 
that homosexuality and even lifelong, monogamous, homo-
sexual relationships reÁ
 ect a broken world in which some 
relationships do not pattern themselves after the creation God 
intended.  While they acknowledge that such relationships may 
be lived out with mutuality and care, they do not believe that the 
neighbor or community are best served by publicly recognizing 
such relationships as traditional marriage.
On the basis of conscience-bound belief, some are convinced 
• 
that the scriptural witness does not address the context of 
sexual orientation and lifelong loving and committed relation-
ships that we experience today.  They believe that the neighbor 
and community are best served when same-gender relationships 
are honored and held to high standards and public account-
ability, but they do not equate these relationships with marriage.  
They do, however, afÀ
 rm the need for community support and 
the role of pastoral care and may wish to surround lifelong, 
monogamous relationships or covenant unions with prayer.
On the basis of conscience-bound belief, some are convinced 
• 
that the scriptural witness does not address the context of

ence today.  They believe that the neighbor and community are 
best served when same-gender relationships are lived out with 
lifelong and monogamous commitments that are held to the 
same rigorous standards, sexual ethics, and status as hetero-
sexual marriage.  They surround such couples and their lifelong 
commitments with prayer to live in ways that glorify God, À

strength for the challenges that will be faced, and serve others. 
They believe same-gender couples should avail themselves of 
social and legal support for themselves, their children, and other 
dependents and seek the highest legal accountability available 
for their relationships.
Although at this time this church lacks consensus on this matter, it encour-
ages all people to live out their faith in the local and global community of 
the baptized with profound respect for the conscience-bound belief of the 
neighbor.  This church calls for mutual respect in relationships and for guid-
ance that seeks the good of each individual and of the community.  Regard-
ing our life together as we live with disagreement, the people in this church 
will continue to accompany one another in study, prayer, discernment, 
pastoral care, and mutual respect.
Loving families: ground and source for social trust
One of the places where social trust is most important is in the context of 
the family.  In contemporary society, the term “family” includes a variety of 
forms, more akin to the older term of “household,” exclusively employed 
by Luther to include immediate family members, relatives, and others. 
Lutherans understand that intimacy, trust, and safety, particularly for those 
most vulnerable, are best sheltered within families.  When safety and trust 
are eroded or destroyed within the family, it becomes a dangerous or even 
demonic place where abuse can reign.  Thus, Lutherans take great care to 
support whatever creates and sustains strong families as a foundation and 
source of trust.
Children learn either trust or distrust from their earliest relationships of 
dependence upon parents and others in the household.  Patterns of loyalty 
and conÀ
 dence established in the family can reach into all future relation-
ships.  Those who do not learn to trust face signiÀ
 cant obstacles to becom-
ing trustworthy individuals in the more complicated relationships of mod-
ern life and may À
 nd it difÀ
 cult to develop a mature and healthy sexuality.
The family is a primary source of trust precisely because of the remark-
able level of commitment and care that characterizes familial bonds.  While 
Scripture places family as secondary to the community of God’s people 
(Matthew 10:37; 12:49), it also attests to the family’s foundational role in 
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
21
protecting and nurturing human community (Exodus 20:12; Ephesians 
6:1–4). The Lutheran Confessions recognize this role27 and the connection 
between family and sexuality in their discussions of the commandments 
related to each.28 
This church regards the family as an indispensable social institution because 
of its role in establishing conditions of trust and protection of the vulner-
able.  As such, society properly both regulates and shelters families through 
family law that exists to ensure that these critical responsibilities will be met 
and that dependent family members will be protected and treated justly 
when households dissolve.29
 
Social service ministries of this and other churches work to secure the 
well-being of families in many ways.  They give particular attention to those 
who have no family or to families with limited resources.  They raise their 
moral voice to afÀ
 rm and celebrate the life-giving importance of familial 
covenants of care.  They teach others to embrace these callings of responsi-
bility and love. 
At the same time, realistic awareness of weakness and sin prevents Luther-
ans from romanticizing family life or setting up false ideals.  In particular, 
sexual abuse or betrayal of promises and commitments within the family 
constitute Á
 agrant harm precisely because they occur within the context 
where trust is most assumed.
This church recognizes its responsibility in congregations and through 
social ministry organizations to support its members and others in all the 
difÀ
 culties that beset family life and to seek ways to ensure and support the 
protection of the most vulnerable.
Many current social trends30 in the United States and elsewhere properly 
raise concerns about the health of families. While these trends do involve 
individuals who carry personal responsibility for their choices, they also are 
driven by economic and social forces that are both complex in origin and 
signiÀ
 cantly resistant to correction.
In this country and throughout the twentieth century, the legally married, 
heterosexual “nuclear family” has been supported by strong social conven-
tions.31  The nuclear family is well-structured to foster the development of 
A Social Statement
22
trust in children and youth.  The experience of millions of people and re-
cent social science À
 ndings demonstrate its ability to do so.32  This does not 
mean, however, that it has always done so effectively. Families can shelter 
sexism or domestic violence, and, in such situations, the safety of children 
or others who are harmed is of utmost importance.33
In this country and in our congregations, families are formed in many ways.  
There are natural and adoptive families, foster families, blended families, 
families with a missing generation, and families where the parents are the 
same gender.  Millions of households in the U.S., and many in our church, 
are headed by single parents—mostly women—whether widowed, divorced, 
or never married.  The critical issue with respect to the family is not wheth-
er it has a conventional form but how it performs indispensable individual 
and social tasks.  All families have responsibility for the tasks of providing 
safety, shielding intimacy, and developing trustworthy relationships. 
This church’s À
 rst response toward families and households should be one 
of welcome and support that includes particularly the care for and safety 
of children.  Children are to be invited into the community of the baptized 
regardless of their family situation.
This church responds to the needs of families through its ministry and 
service in various settings.  It also has the task of addressing and advocating 
against social and economic trends that counter the development of strong 
families.
Through the proclamation of God’s Word and the sacraments, God cre-
ates and strengthens faith and supports believers both inside and outside 
of families.  Family life also is supported when its members strive to meet 
reasonable expectations to forgive and to seek forgiveness and to bear each 
other’s burdens responsibly.  These practices honor God and, when learned 
in the context of a loving and committed family, may lead to mature and 
healthy expressions of sexuality.  When trust has been betrayed in such 
situations, then forgiveness, loving correction, and reconciliation must be 
attempted.
This church acknowledges with regret the way in which the misuse of 
historical teachings concerning sexuality has harmed individuals, deepened 
suffering, or torn families apart.  This includes actions that abandon or 
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
23
shun people for unwed pregnancy or for a same-gender orientation.  Hate 
crimes and violence against those who are regarded as sexually different 
sometimes have been perpetrated publicly in the name of Christ.  Not only 
must such behaviors be denounced, but this church must work toward 
greater understanding of sexual orientation and gender identity.34  It must 
seek that which is positive and life-giving while protecting from all that is 
harmful and destructive.
Since social trust is directly related to social justice, this church must call for 
justice in matters relating to families and sexuality.  Complex and profound 
changes have occurred in family law over the past À
 fty years relating to 
divorce, alimony and child support, custody, adoption, parental rights, and 
civil unions.  The continuing evolution of family law is of vital importance 
as legislators and courts strive to protect dependent individuals and justly 
assign responsibility for their care.
These laws have a direct impact on patterns of social trust within house-
holds and networks of kinship.  Criminal statutes, state enforcement, and 
judicial handling of matters related to sexual abuse, sexual harassment, 
sexual threats, and domestic violence require our close attention.  Victims 
of sexual violation must be able to rely on public institutions for interven-
tion in troubled relationships.  They must be able to expect protection when 
their trust in an individual has been abused.
Society at large must ensure that all who are dependent upon others in the 
family for spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being are protected by social 
policies and practices.  Even social institutions and practices not directly 
related to family institutions can and should facilitate and support familial care 
and responsibility.  Examples include tax and poverty law, real estate and zon-
ing regulations, and insurance industry policies and practices.
The ELCA will support familial relationships as central to nurturing and sus-
taining trust and security in human relationships.  It will advocate for public 
policies that support and protect families.  This church commits itself to 
continued attention to and discernment about changing family conÀ
 gurations 
and the ways they serve to shelter and protect relationships of mutual trust.

Protecting children and youth in and for trusting relationships
A strong and healthy family is a signiÀ
 cant factor in the development of 
healthy individuals.  The context of a healthy family nurtures growth, en-
hances trust, and offers protection. This is especially true for children and 
youth as they grow into sexual maturity.
Safety within and outside the family is of overriding importance because 
the damage done to children and youth through sexual abuse or molestation 
can be remarkably deep and lasting.  Such harmful behavior may include 
inappropriate touching, exposure to pornography, exposing genitals to 
children or inducing children to do the same, and sexual or genital relations 
involving minors.
Criminal statutes prohibiting abuse and molestation contribute to the protec-
tion of children and youth.  This church supports the prosecution of any 
individual who commits a sexual crime against a minor, including people in 
leadership positions in the church.  Further, this church afÀ
 rms appropriate 
laws requiring the reporting of suspected child abuse to authorities in order 
to prevent future harm to vulnerable minors who cannot protect themselves.
 
The ELCA also recognizes that congregations and other ministry sites must 
continue in their efforts to be safe places for children and youth.  Much 
work already has been done to help congregations protect children.  This 
church will continue its efforts for the protection of minors who participate 
in church-sponsored events and programs.  This church calls for the adop-
tion of preventive measures, including educational programs, appropriate 
policies, and screening of individuals who care for, supervise, or work with 
children within this church.  It expects that all church leaders will report all 
instances of suspected child abuse.
Matters of concern to both society and the church extend beyond abuse 
and molestation to organized sexual exploitation.  Commercial sexual 
exploitation is widespread throughout the United States and around the 
world.  It continues to grow and involves surprising numbers of youth by 
taking advantage of their vulnerabilities.35 
This church strongly reafÀ
 rms its 2001 message, “Commercial Sexual 
Exploitation,” which states: “Sexual exploitation in any situation, either 
personally or commercially, inside or outside legally contracted marriage, is 
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
25
sinful because it is destructive of God’s good gift [of sexuality] and human 
integrity.”  This message notes that this is especially true with respect to the 
demonic harm sexual exploitation causes to children and youth.36 
Children and youth live in a highly sexualized world.  They are exposed 
early to patterns of adult sexuality and are pressured to associate their 
bodies with practices that devalue them. Examples include child beauty 
contests, sexually suggestive clothing, sexually charged prime-time and cable 
television programs, and movies.  At an early age, children listen to sexual-
ized music that is deliberately marketed to them.  They “date” as couples 
and engage in genital activity at earlier ages. Children and youth are targets 
of sexual bullying, destructive language, and vicious humor.
The ELCA regards the over-exposure of emotionally maturing children and 
teens to adult sexuality as a failing on the part of adults and society.  It chal-
lenges all individuals and institutions in society to fulÀ
 ll their responsibility 
to protect and nurture children and youth and provide for their appropri-
ate development.  Congregations should offer opportunities for adults to 
express these concerns and explore solutions together.
Expanding cyberspace and other electronic media create new challenges to 
the protection of children and youth.  It is important that parents, society, 
and lawmakers continue to be extremely vigilant to protect the well-being 
of children and youth in this electronic world with its often-hidden dangers. 
 
The widespread electronic availability of violent and degrading pornogra-
phy threatens children and youth as well as adults.  It has the capacity to 
damage the normal sexual development in those who view it, often obses-
sively and in secret.  How to address this problem is one of the most im-
portant child-protection issues of our time, and our church will be an active 
participant in this important conversation.
The sexual education of children and teens will be supported as a priority 
by this church.  Anecdotal evidence among teens suggests that few parents 
or congregations meaningfully engage young people in either sex education 
or healthy conversations about sexuality, even though teens would welcome 
them.37  This lack of engagement is remarkable, especially considering the 
associated dangers.  This church will give particular attention to how chil-
dren and youth are supported, nurtured, and accompanied in their sexual 
and relational formation.
A Social Statement
26
Toward that end, this church reafÀ
 rms what it has said previously about 
providing comprehensive sex education within the context of Christian 
faith.38  This education must begin early and emphasize responsibility and 
mutuality.  Such education should focus on sustained conversation about 
what is good and what is harmful in ways appropriate to growing matu-
rity levels.  It should avoid simply requiring compliance with approved or 
rejected behaviors.  Rather it should emphasize the exploration of why cer-
tain behaviors are rejected because they are damaging, why and how some 
pressures should be resisted, and what differentiates mature and rewarding 
sexual love from exploitative and demeaning forms.
Information about birth control, including the encouragement and support 
of sexual abstinence, is an important component of responsibility.  Such 
education should engage all in conversation about the shared responsibil-
ity of couples to ensure the physical, emotional, and spiritual protection of 
each person.
It therefore follows that the ELCA reafÀ
 rms its interest in and responsibil-
ity for the care and protection of vulnerable children and youth.  It under-
stands itself as called to this mission through the vocations of its members, 
its own institutional practices, and its public policy positions.  This work 
involves all adults, not only parents, since all contribute to the well-being of 
children and youth in untold creative ways.  It understands that all chil-
dren and youth, both inside and outside the church, are deserving of this 
church’s concern.
V.  Sexuality and trust in relationships                                                                      
Sexuality and self
Both sexuality and trust are fundamentally relational and grow out of the 
web of family ties and social interaction.  Healthy, trusting relationships 
shape conÀ
 dent, healthy, and responsible people.  We bring our failings, 
imperfections, and sin with us into our relationships, but part of living out 
the calling and freedom of the Christian in those relationships includes be-
ing the best we can be as individuals.  This requires appropriate care for all 
aspects of a person, including the body.39 
We are sexual beings from the beginning of our lives.  The ancient psalm-
ist envisioned the divine mystery of our embodied lives long before sci-
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
27
ence investigated our biological and genetic complexity: “For it was you 
who formed my inward parts; you knit me together in my mother’s womb” 
(Psalm 139:13).  The realities of our sexual bodies are visible in physical 
features and powerful in less visible characteristics.
This means much more than that we are born with male, female, or some-
times with ambiguous genitalia.40  Our cells carry sex chromosomes, and 
our endocrine systems infuse our bodies with hormones.  In ways that are 
still not fully understood, we develop strong gender identities at a very early 
age.  While there is still much to be learned about the biological complexity 
of human beings, we have come to understand that this complexity sug-
gests a variety of sexual orientations and gender identities.
Sexuality and gender are features of each person’s very being. This is both a 
discovery and a gift, and a perplexity and a challenge at all life stages and in 
all relational situations.  The medical and social sciences continue to explore 
how the range of human sexual identities and behaviors are understood, 
cared for, and regulated in various cultures and religions.
Sexual capabilities and experiences are part of life for all ages and physi-
cal abilities.  One can experience the sexual in music, art, literature, and the 
beauty of people and nature.  One can take sensual pleasure in food, touch, 
sound, smells, and activities.  One can À
 nd expression for the self and for 
sexuality through the spoken word, touch, dance, music, and movement.
One does not need to be in a relationship to experience one’s sexuality.  Bod-
ies do not suddenly become sexual at puberty and do not cease to be sexual 
when, for example, there are physical or developmental limitations, meno-
pause, erectile dysfunction, or the absence of a sexual partner.  This means 
that throughout our lives we need to À
 nd life-enhancing and appropriate ways 
of giving expression to this complicated dimension of ourselves.
We all have sexual identities that will À
 nd expression in our lives.  We have 
sexual feelings that we are aware of and sometimes need to be negotiated 
when we are interacting with friends, courting a potential life partner, work-
ing closely with colleagues, or sharing our lives with another.  Moreover, we 
must evaluate and respond constantly to the ways in which the sexuality of 
others is expressed.  We must respond to sexual stimuli in the environment, 
including the varieties of human touch, which may vary from casual contact

 irtatious appreciation to invitations to intense physical intimacy.
A healthy sense of sexuality is related to having a healthy body image.  This 
church teaches that caring for the body and following practices that lead 
to physical and emotional wellness are part of the stewardship of created 
goodness.41  It recognizes that a positive sense of one’s own body supports 
a healthy sense of one’s gender identity and sexuality.
Sexually mature, healthy individuals learn to be comfortable with their bod-
ies and are able to entrust themselves to others. They call frankly upon oth-
ers to respect and honor their privacy, their bodily integrity, and their wishes 
concerning welcome and unwelcome touch.
Sometimes, it can be very hard to develop and maintain positive attitudes 
about one’s body.  Too many people struggle for a healthy sense of body as 
a result of experiences of degradation or shaming by others, including fam-
ily members and intimate partners.  This church will support all in afÀ
 rming 
and reclaiming a sense of healthy sexuality.
This church calls attention to the danger of embracing standards of 
physical attractiveness that exclude many, including the aged and people 
with disabilities, and which distort the understanding of what it means to 
be healthy.  The young, whose bodies are changing and growing, may be 
especially vulnerable to idealized and commercialized images of a “perfect 
body” that play on insecurities and destructive self-loathing. 
A holistic understanding of the interrelationship of body, mind, and spirit 
challenges such narrow understandings of beauty.  It enables us better to 
afÀ
 rm the many dimensions of beauty and to celebrate human variety and 
particularity.  This church is committed to afÀ
 rming throughout life the 
value, beauty, and health of the human body and human sexuality.  It is 
mindful that physical, emotional, relational, and spiritual wellness contribute 
to a lower incidence of at-risk behaviors for all people, including youth.42 
Gender and friendships
This church also calls attention to the immense value of friendship for 
people in all stages of life.  Human life in relationship includes many differ-
ent forms of rewarding human companionship.  Friendships express our 
longing for human connection, touch, and growth.  They allow space for 
self-revelation in the shelter of various degrees of mutual commitment and

regard.  The ELCA encourages and celebrates all situations and initiatives 
that engage people in relationships of friendship and trust, both inside and 
outside the church community.  It also recognizes the importance of strong 
social support for friendships.
Many of our understandings of our own sexuality and sexual relationships 
may be formed or nurtured through conversations and conÀ
 ding in friends.  
Friendships may help us develop a sense of our own beauty and the integ-
rity of our bodies.  As with parents or family members, we may learn from 
friends a sense of caring and safe touch in trusting relationships. Friend-
ship, like family life, is a trust that can be betrayed, abused, and violated.  It 
also must be recognized that dysfunctional friendships may be detrimental 
to health, development, and well-being.
This church calls people to be good, trustworthy friends who support one 
another in mature self-understanding and healthy companionship.  Friends 
together have the shared power and responsibility to contradict demeaning 
and demoralizing messages from the media about sexuality and to over-
come the effects of physical and emotional abuse.  Friends also have the 
responsibility to respect one another’s physical and emotional boundaries.
Community and workplace relationships are spheres of human life in which 
friendships and companionship can and do thrive. They are also places 
where trust and distrust mix in complicated ways.
Sometimes friendships become sexual in the narrower sense of giving rise 
to overtly erotic impulses and stimulation.  Erotic interest between adults 
open to a romantic relationship can be a desired part of the growth of trust 
and intimacy.  Erotic interest can also create conÁ
 icts and danger.  These 
have to be faced honestly when one or both of the people involved already 
have made promises of À
 delity to another.  The conÁ
 icts and dangers have 
to be recognized, also, whenever one of the involved individuals does not 
welcome a deeper and more complicated closeness.
Reintroducing distance into such friendships or breaking them off may en-
tail an acceptance of loss that requires courage and maturity.  The violation 
of trusting relationships for sexual purposes is offensive and unacceptable, 
and, when criminal, should be punished accordingly.  A particularly egre-
gious violation of friendship is acquaintance rape. 
A Social Statement

Commitment and sexuality
Human beings remain sexual creatures for life.  As a result, they must 
cultivate and manage relationships along a spectrum that runs from casual 
associations to intense intimacy.  The deepening of trust and commitment 
is a lengthy process that requires deliberate attention and effort.  Recogniz-
ing this provides a way of thinking about how people come to select life 
partners and about their sexual conduct in that process.
Couples, whether teenage, young adult, mature, or senior, move from a À
 rst 
acquaintance into a journey of increasing knowledge, appreciation, and 
trust in each other.  This journey involves spiritual, emotional, intellectual, 
and physical dimensions of self-understanding.  When these dimensions 
develop at similar rates, trust and entrusting are established and secured.  
When they are out of balance, trust may either not exist or disintegrate. 
As trust and entrusting are established in a relationship, physical expression 
naturally becomes more intimate.  That is, sexual intimacy would be expect-
ed to follow the same pattern of growth marked by the other dimensions 
of mutual self-understanding.
For this reason, this church teaches that degrees of physical intimacy should 
be carefully matched to degrees of growing affection and commitment.  
This also suggests a way to understand why this church teaches that the 
greatest sexual intimacies, such as coitus, should be matched with and shel-
tered both by the highest level of binding commitment and by social and 
legal protection, such as is found in marriage. Here, promises of À
 delity and 
public accountability provide the foundational basis and support for trust, 
intimacy, and safety, especially for the most vulnerable.
This is why this church opposes non-monogamous, promiscuous, or casual 
sexual relationships of any kind. Indulging immediate desires for satisfac-
tion, sexual or otherwise, is to “gratify the desires of the Á
 esh” (Galatians 
5:16–19).  Such transient encounters do not allow for trust in the relation-
ship to create the context for trust in sexual intimacy.
Such relationships undermine the dignity and integrity of individuals 
because physical intimacy is not accompanied by the growth of mutual self-
knowledge.  Absent the presence of physical, emotional, intellectual, and 
spiritual trust and commitment, such sexual relationships may easily dam-
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
31
age the self and an individual’s future capacity to live out committed and 
trustworthy relationships.  Fleeting relationships misuse the gift of sexual 
intimacy and are much more likely to be unjust, abusive, and exploitative.
Although this church strongly discourages such relationships, it nevertheless 
insists that every sexual relationship entails responsibility.  All sexually active 
people have the responsibility to protect their sexual partner from both 
emotional and physical harm as well as to protect themselves and their part-
ners from sexually transmitted diseases and the possibility of an unwanted 
pregnancy.
Sexual intimacy and adult cohabitation
Many contemporary pressures encourage adult cohabitation. When mar-
riage is delayed for years beyond the age of physical sexual maturity, the 
emotional and physical pressures for intimacy may grow.  Social trends in 
this society, such as extensive schooling, downward wage pressure, and even 
the desire for expensive weddings, may further encourage that delay.
While some of these trends are the result of individual choices, they also 
may be inÁ
 uenced by broader social forces: the increasing number of failed 
marriages, social acceptance of casual sex, and the strong cultural inÁ
 uence 
of individualism that largely ignores social responsibility and accountability. 
All are examples of why many may question the need for—and sometimes 
even the rationale for—binding relationships.
In addition, certain laws and economic realities in this society may create 
extreme economic hardship for some, including older adults, who desire to 
be legally married.  This church calls for altering laws and the factors that 
create a signiÀ
 cant impediment to marriage for such people.
Because this church urges couples to seek the highest social and legal support 
for their relationships, it does not favor cohabitation arrangements outside of 
marriage.  It has a special concern when such arrangements are entered into 
as an end in themselves.  It does, however, acknowledge the social forces at 
work that encourage such practices.  This church also recognizes the pastoral 
and familial issues that accompany these contemporary social patterns.
In cases where a decision is made for cohabitation, regardless of the 
reasons, this church expects its pastors and members to be clear with the 
A Social Statement
32
couple regarding the reasons for the position of this church and to support 
the couple in recognizing their obligation to be open and candid with each 
other about their plans, expectations, and levels of mutual commitment.
It should be noted that some cohabitation arrangements can be constructed 
in ways that are neither casual nor intrinsically unstable.  In earlier genera-
tions, betrothal carried obligations similar to those of marriage.  In certain 
situations, conventional or even legal obligations accompany cohabitation 
arrangements.  In some states, for instance, laws govern “common-law 
marriages.”  Such arrangements may differ markedly from more transitory 
forms of cohabitation.
This church believes, however, that the deepest human longings for a sense 
of personal worth, long-term companionship, and profound security, espe-
cially given the human propensity to sin, are best served through binding 
commitment, legal protections, and the public accountability of marriage, 
especially where the couple is surrounded by the prayers of the congrega-
tional community and the promises of God.
VI.  Sexuality and social responsibility                                                                      
Sexuality and society
Neither individuals nor families can succeed alone; they need healthy and 
supportive communities.43  Individuals are deeply social and therefore 
profoundly shaped by these communities, even in their most private and 
intimate moments.  Given this reality, we must appreciate the signiÀ
 cant 
inÁ
 uence, both positive and negative, of social forces and social contexts on 
human sexual behavior.
This church must be prepared to speak out where such forces cause harm.  
In particular, it will oppose all forms of sexual exploitation within and out-
side this church.  Justice for women in church and society must continue to 
be an important dimension of Lutheran concern and action.
This church also will attend to the need for equal protection, equal op-
portunities, and equal responsibilities under the law, and just treatment for 
those with varied sexual orientation and gender identity.  Such individu-
als are disproportionately and negatively affected by patterns of stigma, 
discrimination, and abuse.  Likewise, it will attend to the particular needs 
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
33
of children and the families of those with actual or perceived differences in 
sexual orientation or gender identity because they are especially vulnerable 
to verbal, physical, emotional, spiritual, psychological, and sexual abuse.
This church notes with grave concern the public commodiÀ
 cation44 of the 
human body as an economic asset. The sexual body is never to be used 
as an object for commercial purposes, and this church will speak against 
the public idolatry of pleasure, freedom, and wealth that undergirds such 
practices.
Especially deplorable are the billion-dollar global sex market and the 
economic systems that thrive on it, both in the United States and abroad.45  
The people trapped in this system are damaged and often destroyed by 
degradation, abuse, and, sometimes, torture.  Companies that proÀ
 t from 
this enterprise need to be identiÀ
 ed and strongly denounced.  This church 
supports building international agreements and national laws to prevent 
these practices.
The possibility of proÀ
 t is not a sufÀ
 cient moral basis to use human sexual-
ity for purposes that harm individuals or undermine social trust.46  The 
ELCA opposes the sale and purchase of pornography.  It also objects to 
commercial and technological efforts to sell sex, including mass media and 
commercial marketing, since these negatively impact individuals and society 
in signiÀ
 cant ways.
Christian responsibility includes naming economic forces and monitoring 
the ways in which they constrain or support healthy individual choices and 
social structures.  This church will advocate against all that systematically 
undermines efforts to raise healthy children and to build solid marriages 
and trusting relationships, including the portrayal of responsible sexuality as 
abnormal and burdensome and promiscuous sexual activity as normal and 
consequence-free.
This church will respond in situations where business and corporate enter-
prises seek proÀ
 t through disrespectful treatment of the human body.  This 
church will work with public and private institutions47 to create structures, 
policies, and practices of accountability to support social norms of protec-
tion.  These include codes of practice that protect society, especially children 
and the most vulnerable, from the misuse and abuse of sexuality for proÀ
 t.
A Social Statement
34
This church will work with all people to craft fair and comprehensive laws 
particularly aimed at protecting the weakest and most vulnerable among us, 
especially children, from sexual harm.
This church supports the development and use of medical products, birth 
control, and initiatives that support fulÀ
 lling and responsible sexuality.  This 
church also recognizes the important role that the availability of birth con-
trol has played in allowing women and men to make responsible decisions 
about the bearing and rearing of children.
This church, in its concern for the neighbor, has a responsibility to be con-
cerned about public health issues.  All people who have contracted a 
sexually transmitted disease have an absolute responsibility to inform their 
sexual partners and all who are at risk.
Care must be taken in sex education materials and processes to inform 
about the dangers of diseases without teaching that sexual expression is 
intrinsically dirty and dangerous.  Efforts at public education and protec-
tion from disease should be supported.  This includes efforts that challenge 
stigma and discrimination, especially against those living with and affected 
by HIV and AIDS.  This church, including its institutions and agencies, 
should be an active partner in discussions about how to address and contain 
epidemics of such diseases.
This church supports social policies and practices that encourage the 
growth of healthy relationships and will question publicly those that erode 
social trust or undermine the structures within which trust is learned and 
preserved.  The traditional concerns of this church for social justice and 
the protection of the vulnerable also will guide its teachings and practices in 
relation to social trust and sexuality.
Sexuality and public ministry
This church does not tolerate the abuse of the ministerial ofÀ
 ce for per-
sonal sexual gratiÀ
 cation.  This church holds high expectations for those in-
dividuals called to serve as rostered leaders.  Pastors, associates in ministry, 
deaconesses, and diaconal ministers who abuse the trust placed in them by 
engaging in promiscuity, inÀ
 delity, adultery, or forms of sexual abuse violate 
those high standards.  Such violations severely damage the credibility of the 
public ministry to which this church and its leaders are called.
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust

Sexuality in the workplace
In all workplaces, supervisors, co-workers, professionals, and clients must 
negotiate complex relationships.  The sexual dimension of these relationships, 
both in the general sense and in the sometimes more speciÀ
 cally erotic sense, 
needs to be honestly recognized.
Employers and supervisors, including within this church, must pay particular 
attention to work relationships between colleagues, especially where there are 
power differentials, and where the workplace environment is rendered sexu-
ally offensive or hostile by the conduct of co-workers. 
The workplace requires appropriate boundaries that are maintained through 
respect, good sense, best practices, and legal protections.  This church re-
mains committed to its own efforts to help make congregations, synods, and 
the churchwide organization safe and healthy places to live and work.  The 
ELCA will not tolerate sexual harassment within the workplace.
VII.  Conclusion                                                                                                                      
Human sexuality and moral discernment
This social statement grows out of the foundational theological understand-
ing that Lutherans read and understand the Bible in light of the death and 
resurrection of Jesus Christ.  The “good news” of the Gospel that we are 
freed from bondage to sin (justiÀ
 cation before God) allows us to respond to 
the Triune God’s mercy through love for and service to the neighbor (voca-
tion in the world).  The social statement further afÀ
 rms that because God’s 
promises are trustworthy, each of us is called in Christian freedom to be trust-
worthy in our relationships with one another and to build social institutions 
and practices that create trust.
Because of the love of the Triune God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, we are a 
people set free for lives of responsibility committed to seeking the good of all.  
This statement responds to this church’s call for a foundational framework48 
that will help it discern what it means to follow faithfully God’s law of love in 
the increasingly complex sphere of human sexuality.  It does not offer once-
and-for-all answers to contemporary questions.  Rather, it seeks to tap the deep 
roots of Scripture and the Lutheran theological tradition for speciÀ
 c Christian 
convictions, themes, and wisdom that will assist people of faith to discern what 
is responsible and faithful action in the midst of the complexity of daily life.
A Social Statement
36
It proposes guideposts to direct this church’s discernment as it tries to be 
faithful.  It provides markers by which individual and communal decisions 
can be tested under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  It seeks to describe 
the social realities of this age and to address them pastorally.  Insofar as it 
is possible, it also seeks to speak in ways that can address both religious and 
secular discussions of these matters.
The necessity of mercy, always
Human lives are littered with broken promises and betrayed trust.  Not ev-
eryone knows how to trust, and not everyone is trustworthy.  Relationships 
end because trust has been broken. Given À
 nitude and sin, many things 
happen that threaten trust in even the strongest relationships.  Forgiveness 
and reconciliation, then, join with mutuality and justice to support trust and 
trustworthiness in relationships.
Seeking the Spirit’s guidance, we discern direction for living faithfully in 
terms of human sexuality.  We do this not in some abstract ideal realm but 
amid all the complexities, conÁ
 icts, sorrows, discoveries, and joys of actual 
social and individual life.  It is a task that this church accepts as a redeemed 
community.  As simultaneously captive to sin and yet liberated and forgiven 
people of faith, we walk together both humbly and boldly toward God’s 
promised future.
Addendum                                                                                                                            
“An addendum summarizing differing points of view shall be added to 
those statements that elicit signiÀ
 cant division in the Churchwide Assem-
bly.” Policies and Procedures of  the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America for 
Addressing Social Concerns (2006), page 16.
An amendment (as shown below) received signiÀ
 cant support at the 
Churchwide Assembly but did not receive the vote needed for approval:
 “. . . The historic Christian tradition and the Lutheran Confessions have 
teach taught and recognized recognize marriage as a normative, lifelong 
covenant between a man and a woman, reÁ
 ecting Mark 10:6–9: ‘But from 
the beginning of creation, God made them male and female.  For this rea-
son a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and 
the two shall become one Á
 esh.  So they are no longer two, but one Á
 esh.  
Therefore what God has joined together, let no one put asunder.’  (Jesus 
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
37
here recalls Genesis 1:27; 2:23–24.)”  Marriage thus provides the possibility 
for the added blessing of children and the joy and responsibility for raising 
them in the faith.
End Notes                                                                                                                                   
1Neighbor, as used in this statement, includes various meanings.  It often follows the 
use in Matthew 22, where Jesus clearly intends family, friends, co-workers, and local 
acquaintances. But it also can be enlarged to include groups and broad social networks, 
which are important in Scripture also (Galatians 6:10). The meaning here depends on 
the context.
2 Trust, as used in this statement, is a fundamental characteristic of right relationship. 
God is unfailingly trustworthy to us and all of creation. Just as we learn by faith that a 
right relationship with God is a relationship of trust rather than rebellious self-asser-
tion, a right relationship with the neighbor is one in which each seeks to be truly worthy 
of the other’s trust. The trustworthiness that fosters and can bear the weight of the 
other’s trust emerges as a central value to cherish and promote. Broken promises and 
betrayed trust through lies, exploitation, and manipulative behavior are exposed, not just 
as an individual failing, but as an attack on the foundations of our lives as social beings. 
Trust is misunderstood if reduced to an emotion, an abstract principle, or a virtue of 
one’s disposition, although these all suggest its multidimensional role as an axis in hu-
man life. 
      In The Responsible Self (1963), H. Richard Niebuhr set Christian ethical reÁ
 ection on 
a new course by treating trust as the center of Christian thinking, based on the question 
of trust or distrust of God as the fundamental option in human existence.  In terms of 
human relationships, he wrote, “Faith as trust or distrust accompanies all our encoun-
ters with others and qualiÀ
 es all our responses” (118). Philosophers and theorists such 
as Hannah Arendt (The Human Condition, 1958) and Michael Polanyi (Personal Knowledge, 
1958) have advanced reÁ
 ection on the centrality of promise and networks of trusting 
reliance in human affairs and knowledge. Some social scientists have begun to identify 
social trust as an indispensable feature of healthy organizations, institutions, and whole 
societies, and social distrust as one of the destructive forces at work in the breakdown 
and dissolution of organized social arrangements. Such reÁ
 ections operate in the back-
ground of this statement.
3  Each “sola” points to the same saving event. That is, they together proclaim Jesus 
Christ as central to the Gospel, each perceived from a different dimension. Other di-
mensions of God’s saving work, other “solas,” also have been associated with Lutheran-
ism. Especially in the nineteenth century, Lutherans began to emphasize sola Scriptura, 
although the Confessions rarely used that phrase. Luther more often spoke of the Word 
of God alone (soli Verbo), by which he meant fundamentally the oral proclamation of 
the Gospel. For a key source suggesting the solas listed here, see Apology of  the Augsburg 
Confession, IV. 120 in The Book of  Concord: The Confessions of  the Evangelical Lutheran Church, 
eds. Robert Kolb and Timothy J. Wengert (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2000), hereafter 
referred to as “BC 2000.”

those who live from Christ, do we know about the beginning.” Dietrich Bonhoeffer,

“third use” of the law, not named here, indicates the law’s role in guiding Christians as 
they seek to orient and conduct their lives; it receives signiÀ
 cant attention in the Formula 
of  Concord. This social statement streamlines its discussion of law by focusing solely on 
the “two uses” but does recognize the role of law as a guide for Christians. Since the 
third use is deÀ
 ned in the Confessions as the civil use of the law by the repentant and 
reborn who keep the law with a willing spirit, this practice seems warranted. See Formula 
of  Concord, Epitome, VI.6 (BC 2000: 502).

11 In Lutheran theology these structures have often been called “orders of creation” to 
express the point that they exist as structures that God uses to order human life.  The 
origin of the term “orders of creation” and its original conceptualization can be traced 
to Christoph Adolf von Harleß (see Christliche Ethik, 7th ed. [Gütersloh: Bertelsmann, 
1875], 491), who proposed this term to highlight the provisional nature of human social 
arrangements.  It soon became linked to a static notion of creation, and the idea of 
“orders” began to be understood as À
 xed, one-time acts of God in the past. 
      As such, they came to indicate the establishment of human society in a hierarchy 
of À
 xed and unchanging social arrangements.  On this basis, at various times some 
Lutheran theologians have objected to the democratic developments in modern states 
Human Sexuality: Gift and Trust
39
on the grounds of the divine right of kings, defended the legitimacy of Hitler’s regime, 
or rejected the ordination of women as contrary to nature.  While “orders of creation” 
also has been theologically enriching within Lutheran tradition, the concept of social 
structures is used here because it is less technical and more suggestive of God’s ongoing 
creative activity to shape and reshape social structures for human protection and good.

the two kingdoms.”  See op cit. Luther’s Works, vol. 45, especially 88–93. 
16 The long-standing Lutheran emphasis on education stems, in part, from understand-
ing it as an arena for service to the neighbor.  See “Our Calling in Education” (Chicago: 
ELCA, 2007), 7–10.
17 This statement attempts to maintain the distinctions frequently made between 
“sexual/sexuality,” “sex,” and “gender.” Generally speaking “sexual/sexuality” here 
refers to biological facts, while “sex” refers to behavior, as in “having sex.” “Gender” 
is reserved, most often, to designate the social and cultural classiÀ
 cations and construc-
tions of biology and behavior.  These distinctions are, of course, hard to maintain with 
precision, but are consistent with dictionary deÀ
 nitions.  The following selected deÀ
 ni-
tions are taken from William Morris, ed., The American Heritage Dictionary of  the English 
Language (Boston: American Heritage Publishing Co., Inc., 1969–1970.): Sexuality: “The 
quality of possessing a sexual character or potency.” Sex: “The sexual urge or instinct as 
it manifests itself in behavior;” or “Sexual intercourse.” Gender: “ClassiÀ
 cation of sex.” 
18 One excellent source in the literature is theorist Niklas Luhmann.  See Trust and Power: 
Two Works by Niklas Luhmann; trans. Howard Davis, John Raffan, Kathryn Rooney 
Chichester (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1979).
19 Scripture uses the words “obedience” (Romans 13) or “honor” (Exodus 20) not to 
refer to the slavish following of rules but to the relationship of mutual trust spoken of 
here in which the repentant sinner willingly responds to God’s commands. Luther cap-
tures this scriptural attitude well in his exposition of the fourth commandment in Large 
Catechism, Ten Commandments, especially par. 167–178 (BC 2000:409).
20 It is no accident, for example, that in economics “credit” plays a crucial role and uses 
a word from the same Latin root as “creed.” Credit literally means “he or she believes” 
that a person will repay a loan.

22 The Latin version of the Augsburg Confession uses the word À
 ducia (trust).
23 Luther’s concluding explanation of the sixth commandment says about marriage:
“... above all it is essential that husband and wife live together in love and harmony, 
cherishing each other wholeheartedly and with perfect À
 delity.” Large Catechism, Ten 
Commandments, par. 219 (BC 200:415).

25 “The difference between interpreters should not be understood as a conÁ
 ict between 
those who seek to be ‘true to Scripture’ and those who seek to ‘twist the Bible’ to their 
own liking. The disagreements are genuine.”  This is the conclusion of Dr. Arland J. 
Hultgren and Dr. Walter F. Taylor Jr.  Both are members of the ELCA and both are 
highly regarded scholars and teachers.  The citation is from Arland Hultgren and Walter 
Taylor, Background Essay on Biblical Texts for Journey Together Faithfully, Part Two: The Church 
and Homosexuality.  (Chicago: ELCA, September 2003), 18.  This essay was written at the 
request of the Task Force for ELCA Studies on Sexuality.  It can be accessed at www.

26 The Apostle Paul testiÀ
 es to conscience as the unconditional moral responsibility 
of the individual before God (Romans 2:15–16).  In the face of different conclusions 
about what constitutes responsible action, the concept of “the conscience” becomes 
pivotal.  
      When the clear word of God’s saving action by grace through faith is at stake, 
Christian conscience becomes as adamant as Paul, who opposed those who insisted 
upon circumcision (Galatians 1:8).  In the same way Luther announced at his trial for 
heresy, “Unless I am persuaded by the testimony of Scripture and by clear reason . . . I 
am conquered by the Scripture passages I have adduced and my conscience is captive to 
the words of God.  I neither can nor desire to recant anything, when to do so against 
conscience would be neither safe nor wholesome” (WA 7: 838; Luther’s Works 32:112).       
However, when the question is about morality or church practice, the Pauline and 
Lutheran witness is less adamant and believes we may be called to respect the bound 
conscience of the neighbor.  That is, if salvation is not at stake in a particular question, 
Christians are free to give priority to the neighbor’s well-being and will protect the con-
science of the neighbor, who may well view the same question in such a way as to affect 
faith itself.  For example, Paul was conÀ
 dent that Christian freedom meant the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ was not at stake in questions of meat sacriÀ
 ced to idols or the rituals of 
holy days (Romans 14; 1 Corinthians 8:10–14 and 10:23–30).  Yet he insisted that, if a 
brother or sister did not understand this freedom and saw eating this meat as idolatry to 
a pagan god, the Christian was obligated to “walk in love” by eating just vegetables for 
the neighbor’s sake (Romans 14:17–20)!  
      This social statement draws upon this rich understanding of the role of conscience 
and calls upon this church, when in disagreement concerning matters around which 
salvation is not at stake, including human sexuality, to bear one another’s burdens (Gala-
tians 6:2), honor the conscience, and seek the well-being of the neighbor.
27 This is evident in Luther’s commentary on parental responsibilities.  See Small Cat-

echism, Preface, par. 19–20 (BC 2000:350), and Large Catechism, Ten Commandments, 
par. 167–78 (BC 2000:409–410). 
28 See, for instance, Luther’s reference to the fourth commandment while discussing the 
sixth: Large Catechism, Ten Commandments, par. 167–178 (BC 2000:413ff.); see also 
par. 206 and 218.
29 These include laws governing marriage, dissolution of marriage, inheritance, guard-
ianship, custody, parental rights and duties, property, pensions, social security, taxes, and 
health beneÀ
 ts.  The interdependence and mutual responsibilities of married couples 
are crucial in welding them into a legal unit as well as a loving household.  Parents and 
guardians are legally compelled to attend to the welfare, support, protection, and educa-
tion of their children and youth.
30 Such trends include remarkably large numbers of physically or psychologically absent 
fathers and teenagers with parenting responsibilities for which they are not prepared.   
They include the reluctance of some men and women to commit themselves to mar-
riage.  Stresses on marriages and individuals in marriages contribute to high rates of 
divorce with accompanying concerns for children and other extended family members.
31 Scripture and the Lutheran Confessions assume and encourage households, similar in 
some ways to this model, but historically and currently there are wide variations that in-
clude many other family members, widowed heads of households, laborers, and the like.
32 This point and the supporting data may be found in various sources. One source is 
the attempt by Don S. Browning to summarize and employ that data for a consecutive 
proposal in Equality and the Family: A Fundamental, Practical Theology of  Children, Mothers, 
and Fathers in Modern Societies (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans Publishing Co., 2005). See espe-
cially the citations in chapters four and seven.

34 Sexual orientation is generally used to refer to an enduring pattern of emotional, ro-
mantic, and sexual attraction. Gender identity indicates a person's own sense of identiÀ
 ca-
tion with a gender (male or female) regardless of physiological characterstics. See also 
footnote 17.

37 Reports were quite consistent on these points both anecdotally and in informal polls 
among youth and youth leaders attending workshops in 2007 and 2008 for Free in Christ 
to Care for the Neighbor: Lutheran Youth Talk about Human Sexuality (Chicago: ELCA, 2007).

be understood as a Christian work in The Freedom of  a Christian in Career of  the Reformer:

40 Some experts estimate that as many as 1 in every 1,500 babies is born with a disorder 
of sex development (DSDs). See www.apa.org/topics/intersx.html (February, 1, 2009). The 
phrase used here, “ambiguous genitalia,” is one form of DSD and indicates a birth 
defect in which the outer genitals do not have the typical appearance of either a boy or 
a girl. See www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003269.htm  (February, 1, 2009).

Adolescent Development (Minneapolis: Search Institute Publications, 2004).
43 Statistically, the healthier that family and community institutions are, the higher the 
number of developmental assets found among its members, especially youth. Strong 
community institutions have a signiÀ
 cant impact on lowering the incidence of at-risk 
behaviors among young people, including intimate sexual activity at young ages. The 
relative health of a community’s institutions, such as schools, churches, and civic organi-
zations, matters signiÀ
 cantly. op. cit. Benson.
44 Public commodiÀ
 cation can be understood as the transformation of any created 
blessing of God into a commodity to be bought and sold.
45 This multi-billion dollar system often is perpetuated by slave-like conditions and 
outright slavery.

buy, as people of faith we realize that what human beings want is not necessarily
what they need for the sake of life.”  SufÀ

1999), 3f.
47 This includes many varieties of social, economic, and business institutions.
