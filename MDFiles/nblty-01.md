<blockquote><blockquote> 
<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p> 

<p><b>THE OPEN LETTER TO THE CHRISTIAN NOBILITY OF THE GERMAN NATION</b>   
 is closely   
 related to the tract ON THE PAPACY AT ROME: A REPLY TO THE CELEBRATED   
 ROMANIST AT LEIPZIG.[1] In a letter to Spalatin[2] dated before June 8, 1520,   
 Luther says: "I shall assail that ass of an Alveld in such wise as not to   
forget the   
 Roman pontiff, and neither of them will be pleased." In the same letter he   
 writes, "I am minded to issue a broadside to Charles and the nobility of   
 Germany against the tyranny and baseness of the Roman curia." The attack upon   
 Alveld is the tract on THE PAPACY AT ROME; the </b>scheda publica</b> grew into the   
 OPEN LETTER. At the time when the letter to Spalatin was written, the work on   
 THE PAPACY AT ROME must have been already in press, for it appeared in print   
 on the 26th of the month,[3] and the composition of the OPEN LETTER had   
 evidently not yet begun. On the 23rd Luther sent the manuscript of the Open   
 Letter to Amsdorf,[4] with the request that be read it and suggest changes.   
 The two weeks immediately preceding the publication of the work ON THE PAPACY   
 must, therefore, have been the time when the Open Letter was composed.   
   
 In the conclusion to the earlier work Luther had said: "Moreover, I should be   
 truly glad if kings, princes, and all the nobles would take hold, and turn the   
 knaves from Rome out of the country, and keep the appointments to bishoprics   
 and benefices out of their hands. How has Roman avarice come to usurp all the   
 foundations, bishoprics and benefices of our fathers? Who has ever read or   
 heard of such monstrous robbery? Do we not also have the people who need them,   
 while out of our poverty we must enrich the ass-drivers and stable-boys, nay,   
 the harlots and knaves at Rome, who look upon us as nothing else but arrant   
 fools, and make us the objects of their vile mockery? Oh, the pity, that kings   
 and princes have so little reverence for Christ, and His honor concerns them   
 so little that they allow such abominations to gain the upper hand, and look   
 on, while at Rome they think of nothing but to continue in their madness and   
 to increase the abounding misery, until no hope is left on earth except in   
 the temporal authorities. Of this I will say more anon, if this Romanist   
 comes again; let this suffice for a beginning. May God help us at length to   
 open our eyes. Amen."</p>   
   
<p>This passage may fairly be regarded as the germ of the Open Letter. The ideas   
 of the latter work are suggested with sufficient clearness to show that its   
 materials are already at hand, and its plan already in the author's mind. The   
 threat to write it is scarcely veiled. That Luther did not wait for that   
 particular Romanist to "come again" may have been due to the intervention of   
 another Romanist, none other than his old opponent, Sylvester Prierias. Before   
 the 7th of June[5] Luther had received a copy of Prierias' <b>Epitome of a Reply   
 to Martin Luther</b>,[6] which is the boldest and baldest possible assertion of   
 the very theory of papal power which Luther had sought to demolish in his   
 tract on the Papacy. In the preface to his reprint of the <b>Epitome</b>,   
Luther bids   
 farewell to Rome: "Farewell, unhappy, hopeless, blasphemous Rome! The wrath of   
 God hath come upon thee, as thou hast deserved! We have cared for Babylon,   
 she is not healed; let us, then, leave her, that she may be the habitation of   
 dragons, specters and witches, and true to her name of Babel, an everlasting   
 confusion; a new pantheon of wickedness."[7] </p>  
   
<p>These words were written while the Open Letter was in course of composition.   
 The Open Letter is, therefore, Luther's first publication after the time when   
 he recognized that the breach between him and the papal church was complete,   
 and likely to be permanent. Meanwhile, the opposing party had come to the same   
 conclusion. The verdict of the pope upon Luther had been long delayed, but on   
 the 15th of June, midway between the letter to Spalatin, above mentioned, and   
 completion of the Open Letter, Leo X signed the bull of excommunication,   
 though it was not published in Germany until later. Thus Open Letter shows us   
 the mind of Luther in the weeks when the permanent separation between him and   
 Rome took place. It was also the time when he had the highest hopes from the   
 promised support of the German knights,[8] who formed the patriotic party   
 Germany and are included in the "nobility" to whom the Open Letter is   
addressed.[9] </p>  
   
<p>The first edition of 4000 copies came off  the press of Melchior Lotther in   
 Wittenberg before the 18th of August.[10] It is surmised[11] that the   
 earlier portion[12] of the work was not contained in the original manuscript,   
 but was added while it was in the printer's hands; perhaps it was added at the   
 suggestion of Amsdorf. Less than a week later a second edition was in course   
 of preparation.[13] This "enlarged and revised edition"[14] contained three   
 passages not included in the first.[15] They are indicated in the notes to the   
 present edition. </p>  
   
<p>He who would know the true Luther must read more than one of his writings;   
 he must not by any chance omit to read the Open Letter to the Christian   
 Nobility of the German Nation. In his other works we learn to know him   
 as the man of God, or the prophet, or the theologian; in this treatise we   
 meet Luther the German. His heart is full of grief for the affliction of his   
 people, and grief turns to wrath as he observes that this affliction is put   
 upon them by the tyranny and greed of the pope and the cardinals and the   
 "Roman vermin?" The situation is desperate; appeals and protests have been all   
 in vain; and so, as a last resort, he turns to the temporal authorities, -- to   
 Charles V, newly elected, but as yet uncrowned; to the territorial lords,   
 great and small, who have a voice in the imperial diet and powers of   
 jurisdiction in their own domains, -- reciting the abuses of "Roman tyranny,"   
 and pleading with them to intervene in behalf of the souls that are going to   
 destruction "through the devilish rule of Rome." It is a cry out of the heart   
 of Germany, a nation whose bent is all religious, but which, from that very   
 circumstance, is all the more open to the insults and wrongs and deceptions of   
 the Roman curia. </p>  
   
<p>Yet it is no formless and incoherent cry, but an orderly recital of the ills   
 of Germany. There are times when we feel in reading it that the writer is   
 laying violent hands on his wrath in the effort to be calm. For all its   
 scathing quality, it is a sane arraignment of those who "under the holy name   
 of Christ and St. Peter" are responsible for the nation's woes, and the   
 remedies that are proposed are, many of them, practicable as well as   
 reasonable. </p>  
   
<p>The materials of the work are drawn from many sources, -- from hearsay, from   
 personal observation, from such histories as Luther had at his command, from   
 the proceedings of councils and of diets; there are passages which would seem   
 to bear more than an accidental resemblance to similar passages in Hutten's   
 <b>VADISCUS</b>. All grist that came to Luther's mill. But the Spirit of the work is   
 Luther's own. </p>  
   
<p>For the general historian, who is concerned more with the practical than with   
 the theoretical or theological aspects of the Reformation, the </b>OPEN LETTER</b> is   
 undoubtedly Luther's greatest work. Its frank outspokenness true condition of   
 Germany, the number and variety of the subjects that it treats, the   
 multiplicity of the sources from which the subject-matter is drawn, and the   
 point of view from which the whole is discussed make it a work of absorbing   
 interest and priceless historical value. It shows, as does no other single   
 work of the Reformation time, the things that were in men's minds and the   
 variety of motives which led them to espouse the cause of the Protestant   
 party. Doctrine, ethics, history, politics, economics, all have their place   
 in the treatise. It is not only "a blast on the war-trumpet," but a connecting   
 link between the thought of the Middle Ages and that of modern  times,   
 prophetic of the new age, but showing how closely the new is bound up with the   
 old. </p>
