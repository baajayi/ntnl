<blockquote><blockquote> 

<p><b><a name="c5">The Fifth Commandment.</a></p>

<p>     Thou shalt not kill.</b></p> 
  
<p>     We have now completed both the spiritual and the temporal 
        government, that is, the divine and the paternal authority and 
        obedience. But here now we go forth from our house among our 
        neighbors to learn how we should live with one another, every 
        one himself toward his neighbor. Therefore God and government 
        are not included in this commandment nor is the power to kill, 
        which they have taken away. For God has delegated His 
        authority to punish evil-doers to the government instead of 
        parents, who aforetime (as we read in Moses) were required to 
        bring their own children to judgment and sentence them to 
        death. Therefore, what is here forbidden is forbidden to the 
        individual in his relation to any one else, and not to the 
        government.</p> 
  
<p>     Now this commandment is easy enough and has been often 
        treated, because we hear it annually in the Gospel of St. 
        Matthew, 5, 21 ff., where Christ Himself explains and sums it 
        up, namely, that we must not kill neither with hand, heart, 
        mouth, signs, gestures, help, nor counsel. Therefore it is 
        here forbidden to every one to be angry, except those (as we 
        said) who are in the place of God, that is, parents and the 
        government. For it is proper for God and for every one who is 
        in a divine estate to be angry, to reprove and punish, namely, 
        on account of those very persons who transgress this and the 
        other commandments.</p> 
  
<p>     But the cause and need of this commandment is that God well 
        knows that the world is evil, and that this life has much 
        unhappiness; therefore He has placed this and the other 
        commandments between the good and the evil. Now, as there are 
        many assaults upon all commandments, so it happens also in 
        this commandment that we must live among many people who do us 
        harm, so that we have cause to be hostile to them.</p> 
  
<p>     As when your neighbor sees that you have a better house and 
        home [a larger family and more fertile fields], greater 
        possessions and fortune from God than he, he is sulky, envies 
        you, and speaks no good of you.</p> 
  
<p>     Thus by the devil's incitement you will get many enemies who 
        cannot bear to see you have any good, either bodily or 
        spiritual. When we see such people, our hearts, in turn, would 
        rage and bleed and take vengeance. Then there arise cursing 
        and blows, from which follow finally misery and murder. Here, 
        now, God like a kind father steps in ahead of Us, interposes 
        and wishes to have the quarrel settled, that no misfortune 
        come of it, nor one destroy another. And briefly He would 
        hereby protect, set free, and keep in peace every one against 
        the crime and violence of every one else; and would have this 
        commandment placed as a wall, fortress, and refuge about our 
        neighbor, that we do him no hurt nor harm in his body.</p> 
  
<p>     Thus this commandment aims at this, that no one offend his 
        neighbor on account of any evil deed, even though he have 
        fully deserved it. For where murder is forbidden, all cause 
        also is forbidden whence murder may originate. For many a one, 
        although he does not kill, yet curses and utters a wish, which 
        would stop a person from running far if it were to strike him 
        in the neck [makes imprecations, which if fulfilled with 
        respect to any one, he would not live long]. Now since this 
        inheres in every one by nature and it is a common practice 
        that no one is willing to suffer at the hands of another, God 
        wishes to remove the root and source by which the heart is 
        embittered against our neighbor, and to accustom us ever to 
        keep in view this commandment, always to contemplate ourselves 
        in it as in a mirror, to regard the will of God, and with 
        hearty confidence and invocation of His name to commit to Him 
        the wrong which we suffer. Thus we shall suffer our enemies to 
        rage and be angry, doing what they can, and we learn to calm 
        our wrath, and to have a patient, gentle heart, especially 
        toward those who give us cause to be angry, that is, our 
        enemies.</p> 
  
<p>     Therefore the entire sum of what it means not to kill is to be 
        impressed most explicitly upon the simple-minded. In the first 
        place that we harm no one, first, with our hand or by deed. 
        Then, that we do not employ our tongue to instigate or counsel 
        thereto. Further, that we neither use nor assent to any kind 
        of means or methods whereby any one may be injured. And 
        finally, that the heart be not ill disposed toward any one, 
        nor from anger and hatred wish him ill, so that body and soul 
        may be innocent in regard to every one, but especially those 
        who wish you evil or inflict such upon you. For to do evil to 
        one who wishes and does you good is not human, but diabolical.</p> 
  
<p>     Secondly, under this commandment not only he is guilty who 
        does evil to his neighbor, but he also who can do him good, 
        prevent, resist evil, defend and save him, so that no bodily 
        harm or hurt happen to him and yet does not do it. If, 
        therefore, you send away one that is naked when you could 
        clothe him, you have caused him to freeze to death; you see 
        one suffer hunger and do not give him food, you have caused 
        him to starve. So also, if you see any one innocently 
        sentenced to death or in like distress, and do not save him, 
        although you know ways and means to do so, you have killed 
        him. And it will not avail you to make the pretext that you 
        did not afford any help, counsel, or aid thereto for you have 
        withheld your love from him and deprived him of the benefit 
        whereby his life would have been saved.</p> 
  
<p>     Therefore God also rightly calls all those murderers who do 
        not afford counsel and help in distress and danger of body and 
        life, and will pass a most terrible sentence upon them in the 
        last day, as Christ Himself has announced when He shall say, 
        Matt.25, 42f.: I was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat; I was 
        thirsty, and ye gave Me no drink; I was a stranger, and ye 
        took Me not in; naked, and ye clothed Me not; sick and in 
        prison and ye visited Me not. That is: You would have suffered 
        Me and Mine to die of hunger thirst, and cold, would have 
        suffered the wild beasts to tear us to pieces, or left us to 
        rot in prison or perish in distress. What else is that but to 
        reproach them as murderers and bloodhounds? For although you 
        have not actually done all this, you have nevertheless, so far 
        as you were concerned, suffered him to pine and perish in 
        misfortune.</p> 
  
<p>     It is just as if I saw some one navigating and laboring in 
        deep water [and struggling against adverse winds] or one 
        fallen into fire, and could extend to him the hand to pull him 
        out and save him, and yet refused to do it. What else would I 
        appear, even in the eyes of the world, than as a murderer and 
        a criminal?</p> 
  
<p>     Therefore it is God's ultimate purpose that we suffer harm to 
        befall no man, but show him all good and love; and, as we have 
        said it is specially directed toward those who are our 
        enemies. For to do good to our friends is but an ordinary 
        heathen virtue as Christ says Matt. 5, 46.</p> 
  
<p>     Here we have again the Word of God whereby He would encourage 
        and urge us to true noble and sublime works, as gentleness 
        patience, and, in short, love and kindness to our enemies, and 
        would ever remind us to reflect upon the First Commandment, 
        that He is our God, that is, that He will help, assist, and 
        protect us, in order that He may thus quench the desire of 
        revenge in us.</p> 
  
<p>     This we ought to practice and inculcate and we would have our 
        hands full doing good works. But this would not be preaching 
        for monks; it would greatly detract from the religious estate, 
        and infringe upon the sanctity of Carthusians, and would even 
        be regarded as forbidding good works and clearing the 
        convents. For in this wise the ordinary state of Christians 
        would be considered just as worthy, and even worthier, and 
        everybody would see how they mock and delude the world with a 
        false, hypocritical show of holiness, because they have given 
        this and other commandments to the winds, and have esteemed 
        them unnecessary, as though they were not commandments but 
        mere counsels, and have at the same time shamelessly 
        proclaimed and boasted their hypocritical estate and works as 
        the most perfect life, in order that they might lead a 
        pleasant, easy life, without the cross and without patience, 
        for which reason, too, they have resorted to the cloisters, so 
        that they might not be obliged to suffer any wrong from any 
        one or to do him any good. But know now that these are the 
        true, holy, and godly works, in which, with all the angels He 
        rejoices, in comparison with which all human holiness is but 
        stench and filth, and besides, deserves nothing but wrath and 
        damnation.</p> 
  
<p><b><a name="c6">The Sixth Commandment.</a></p> 
  
<p>     Thou shalt not commit adultery.</b></p> 
  
<p>     These commandments now [that follow] are easily understood 
        from [the explanation of] the preceding; for they are all to 
        the effect that we [be careful to] avoid doing any kind of 
        injury to our neighbor. But they are arranged in fine 
        [elegant] order. In the first place, they treat of his own 
        person. Then they proceed to the person nearest him, or the 
        closest possession next after his body namely, his wife, who 
        is one flesh and blood with him, so that we cannot inflict a 
        higher injury upon him in any good that is his. Therefore it 
        is explicitly forbidden here to bring any disgrace upon him in 
        respect to his wife. And it really aims at adultery, because 
        among the Jews it was ordained and commanded that every one 
        must be married. Therefore also the young were early provided 
        for [married], so that the virgin state was held in small 
        esteem, neither were public prostitution and lewdness 
        tolerated (as now). Therefore adultery was the most common 
        form of unchastity among them.</p> 
  
<p>     But because among us there is such a shameful mess and the 
        very dregs of all vice and lewdness, this commandment is 
        directed also against all manner of unchastity, whatever it 
        may be called; and not only is the external act forbidden, but 
        also every kind of cause, incitement, and means, so that the 
        heart, the lips, and the whole body may be chaste and afford 
        no opportunity, help, or persuasion to unchastity. And not 
        only this, but that we also make resistance, afford protection 
        and rescue wherever there is danger and need; and again, that 
        we give help and counsel, so as to maintain our neighbor's 
        honor. For whenever you omit this when you could make 
        resistance, or connive at it as if it did not concern you, you 
        are as truly guilty as the one perpetrating the deed. Thus, to 
        state it in the briefest manner, there is required this much, 
        that every one both live chastely himself and help his 
        neighbor do the same, so that God by this commandment wishes 
        to hedge round about and protect [as with a rampart] every 
        spouse that no one trespass against them.</p> 
  
<p>     But since this commandment is aimed directly at the state of 
        matrimony and gives occasion to speak of the same, you must 
        well understand and mark, first, how gloriously God honors and 
        extols this estate, inasmuch as by His commandment He both 
        sanctions and guards it. He has sanctioned it above in the 
        Fourth Commandment: Honor thy father and thy mother; but here 
        He has (as we said ) hedged it about and protected it. 
        Therefore He also wishes us to honor it, and to maintain and 
        conduct it as a divine and blessed estate; because, in the 
        first place, He has instituted it before all others, and 
        therefore created man and woman separately (as is evident), 
        not for lewdness, but that they should [legitimately] live 
        together, be fruitful, beget children, and nourish and train 
        them to the honor of God.</p> 
  
<p>     Therefore God has also most richly blessed this estate above 
        all others, and, in addition, has bestowed on it and wrapped 
        up in it everything in the world, to the end that this estate 
        might be well and richly provided for. Married life is 
        therefore no jest or presumption; but it is an excellent thing 
        and a matter of divine seriousness. For it is of the highest 
        importance to Him that persons be raised who may serve the 
        world and promote the knowledge of God, godly living, and all 
        virtues, to fight against wickedness and the devil.</p> 
  
<p>     Therefore I have always taught that this estate should not be 
        despised nor held in disrepute, as is done by the blind world 
        and our false ecclesiastics, but that it be regarded according 
        to God's Word, by which it is adorned and sanctified, so that 
        it is not only placed on an equality with other estates, but 
        that it precedes and surpasses them all, whether they be that 
        of emperor, princes, bishops, or whoever they please. For both 
        ecclesiastical and civil estates must humble themselves and 
        all be found in this estate as we shall hear. Therefore it is 
        not a peculiar estate, but the most common and noblest estate, 
        which pervades all Christendom, yea which extends through all 
        the world.</p> 
  
<p>     In the second place, you must know also that it is not only an 
        honorable, but also a necessary state, and it is solemnly 
        commanded by God that, in general, in all conditions, men and 
        women, who were created for it, shall be found in this estate; 
        yet with some exceptions (although few) whom God has 
        especially excepted, so that they are not fit for the married 
        estate, or whom He has released by a high, supernatural gift 
        that they can maintain chastity without this estate. For where 
        nature has its course, as it is implanted by God, it is not 
        possible to remain chaste without marriage. For flesh and 
        blood remain flesh and blood, and the natural inclination and 
        excitement have their course without let or hindrance, as 
        everybody sees and feels. In order, therefore, that it may be 
        the more easy in some degree to avoid unchastity, God has 
        commanded the estate of matrimony, that every one may have his 
        proper portion and be satisfied therewith; although God's 
        grace besides is required in order that the heart also may be 
        pure.</p> 
  
<p>     From this you see how this popish rabble, priests, monks, and 
        nuns, resist God's order and commandment, inasmuch as they 
        despise and forbid matrimony, and presume and vow to maintain 
        perpetual chastity, and, besides, deceive the simple-minded 
        with lying words and appearances [impostures]. For no one has 
        so little love and inclination to chastity as just those who 
        because of great sanctity avoid marriage, and either indulge 
        in open and shameless prostitution, or secretly do even worse, 
        so that one dare not speak of it, as has, alas! been learned 
        too fully. And, in short, even though they abstain from the 
        act, their hearts are so full of unchaste thoughts and evil 
        lusts that there is a continual burning and secret suffering, 
        which can be avoided in the married life. Therefore all vows 
        of chastity out of the married state are condemned by this 
        commandment, and free permission is granted, yea, even the 
        command is given, to all poor ensnared consciences which have 
        been deceived by their monastic vows to abandon the unchaste 
        state and enter the married life, considering that even if the 
        monastic life were godly, it would nevertheless not be in 
        their power to maintain chastity, and if they remain in it, 
        they must only sin more and more against this commandment.</p> 
  
<p>     Now, I speak of this in order that the young may be so guided 
        that they conceive a liking for the married estate, and know 
        that it is a blessed estate and pleasing to God. For in this 
        way we might in the course of time bring it about that married 
        life be restored to honor, and that there might be less of the 
        filthy, dissolute, disorderly doings which now run riot the 
        world over in open prostitution and other shameful vices 
        arising from disregard of married life. Therefore it is the 
        duty of parents and the government to see to it that our youth 
        be brought up to discipline and respectability, and when they 
        have come to years of maturity, to provide for them [to have 
        them married] in the fear of God and honorably; He would not 
        fail to add His blessing and grace, so that men would have joy 
        and happiness from the same.</p> 
  
<p>     Let me now say in conclusion that this commandment demands not 
        only that every one live chastely in thought, word, and deed 
        in his condition, that is, especially in the estate of 
        matrimony, but also that every one love and esteem the spouse 
        given him by God. For where conjugal chastity is to be 
        maintained, man and wife must by all means live together in 
        love and harmony, that one may cherish the other from the 
        heart and with entire fidelity. For that is one of the 
        principal points which enkindle love and desire of chastity, 
        so that, where this is found, chastity will follow as a matter 
        of course without any command. Therefore also St. Paul so 
        diligently exhorts husband and wife to love and honor one 
        another. Here you have again a precious, yea, many and great 
        good works, of which you can joyfully boast, against all 
        ecclesiastical estates, chosen without God's Word and 
        commandment.</p> 
  
<p><b><a name="c7">The Seventh Commandment.</a></p> 
  
<p>     Thou shalt not steal.</b> 
  
<p>     After your person and spouse temporal property comes next. 
        That also God wishes to have protected, and He has commanded 
        that no one shall subtract from, or curtail, his neighbor's 
        possessions. For to steal is nothing else than to get 
        possession of another's property wrongfully, which briefly 
        comprehends all kinds of advantage in all sorts of trade to 
        the disadvantage of our neighbor. Now, this is indeed quite a 
        wide-spread and common vice, but so little regarded and 
        observed that it exceeds all measure, so that if all who are 
        thieves, and yet do not wish to be called such, were to be 
        hanged on gallows the world would soon be devastated and there 
        would be a lack both of executioners and gallows. For, as we 
        have just said, to steal is to signify not only to empty our 
        neighbor's coffer and pockets, but to be grasping in the 
        market, in all stores, booths, wine- and beer-cellars, 
        workshops, and, in short, wherever there is trading or taking 
        and giving of money for merchandise or labor.</p> 
  
<p>     As, for instance, to explain this somewhat grossly for the 
        common people, that it may be seen how godly we are: When a 
        manservant or maid-servant does not serve faithfully in the 
        house, and does damage, or allows it to be done when it could 
        be prevented, or otherwise ruins and neglects the goods 
        entrusted to him, from indolence idleness, or malice, to the 
        spite and vexation of master and mistress, and in whatever way 
        this can be done purposely (for I do not speak of what happens 
        from oversight and against one's will), you can in a year 
        abscond thirty, forty florins, which if another had taken 
        secretly or carried away, he would be hanged with the rope. 
        But here you [while conscious of such a great theft] may even 
        bid defiance and become insolent, and no one dare call you a 
        thief.</p> 
  
<p>     The same I say also of mechanics, workmen, and day-laborers, 
        who all follow their wanton notions, and never know enough 
        ways to overcharge people, while they are lazy and unfaithful 
        in their work. All these are far worse than sneak-thieves, 
        against whom we can guard with locks and bolts, or who, if 
        apprehended, are treated in such a manner that they will not 
        do the same again. But against these no one can guard, no one 
        dare even look awry at them or accuse them of theft, so that 
        one would ten times rather lose from his purse. For here are 
        my neighbors, good friends, my own servants, from whom I 
        expect good [every faithful and diligent service], who defraud 
        me first of all.</p> 
  
<p>     Furthermore, in the market and in common trade likewise, this 
        practice is in full swing and force to the greatest extent, 
        where one openly defrauds another with bad merchandise, false 
        measures, weights, coins, and by nimbleness and queer finances 
        or dexterous tricks takes advantage of him; likewise, when one 
        overcharges a person in a trade and wantonly drives a hard 
        bargain, skins and distresses him. And who can recount or 
        think of all these things? To sum up, this is the commonest 
        craft and the largest guild on earth, and if we regard the 
        world throughout all conditions of life, it is nothing else 
        than a vast, wide stall, full of great thieves.</p> 
  
<p>     Therefore they are also called swivel-chair robbers, land- and 
        highway-robbers, not pick-locks and sneak-thieves who snatch 
        away the ready cash, but who sit on the chair [at home] and 
        are styled great noblemen, and honorable, pious citizens, and 
        yet rob and steal under a good pretext.</p> 
  
<p>     Yes, here we might be silent about the trifling individual 
        thieves if we were to attack the great, powerful arch-thieves 
        with whom lords and princes keep company, who daily plunder 
        not only a city or two, but all Germany. Yea, where should we 
        place the head and supreme protector of all thieves, the Holy 
        Chair at Rome with all its retinue, which has grabbed by theft 
        the wealth of all the world, and holds it to this day?</p> 
  
<p>     This is, in short, the course of the world: whoever can steal 
        and rob openly goes free and secure, unmolested by any one, 
        and even demands that he be honored. Meanwhile the little 
        sneak-thieves, who have once trespassed, must bear the shame 
        and punishment to render the former godly and honorable. But 
        let them know that in the sight of God they are the greatest 
        thieves, and that He will punish them as they are worthy and 
        deserve.</p> 
  
<p>     Now, since this commandment is so far-reaching [and 
        comprehensive], as just indicated, it is necessary to urge it 
        well and to explain it to the common people, not to let them 
        go on in their wantonness and security, but always to place 
        before their eyes the wrath of God, and inculcate the same. 
        For we have to preach this not to Christians, but chiefly to 
        knaves and scoundrels, to whom it would be more fitting for 
        judges, jailers, or Master Hannes [the executioner] to preach. 
        Therefore let every one know that it is his duty, at the risk 
        of God's displeasure, not only to do no injury to his 
        neighbor, nor to deprive him of gain, nor to perpetrate any 
        act of unfaithfulness or malice in any bargain or trade, but 
        faithfully to preserve his property for him, to secure and 
        promote his advantage, especially when one accepts money, 
        wages, and one's livelihood for such service.</p> 
  
<p>     He now who wantonly despises this may indeed pass along and 
        escape the hangman, but he shall not escape the wrath and 
        punishment of God; and when he has long practiced his defiance 
        and arrogance, he shall yet remain a tramp and beggar, and, in 
        addition, have all plagues and misfortune. Now you are going 
        your way [wherever your heart's pleasure calls you] while you 
        ought to preserve the property of your master and mistress, 
        for which service you fill your crop and maw, take your wages 
        like a thief, have people treat you as a nobleman; for there 
        are many that are even insolent towards their masters and 
        mistresses, and are unwilling to do them a favor or service by 
        which to protect them from loss.</p> 
  
<p>     But reflect what you will gain when, having come into your own 
        property and being set up in your home (to which God will help 
        with all misfortunes), it [your perfidy] will bob up again and 
        come home to you, and you will find that where you have 
        cheated or done injury to the value of one mite, you will have 
        to pay thirty again.</p> 
  
<p>     Such shall be the lot also of mechanics and day-laborers of 
        whom we are now obliged to hear and suffer such intolerable 
        maliciousness, as though they were noblemen in another's 
        possessions, and every one were obliged to give them what they 
        demand. Just let them continue practicing their exactions as 
        long as they can; but God will not forget His commandment, and 
        will reward them according as they have served, and will hang 
        them, not upon a green gallows, but upon a dry one so that all 
        their life they shall neither prosper nor accumulate anything. 
        And indeed, if there were a well-ordered government in the 
        land, such wantonness might soon be checked and prevented, as 
        was the custom in ancient times among the Romans, where such 
        characters were promptly seized by the pate in a way that 
        others took warning.</p> 
  
<p>     No more shall all the rest prosper who change the open free 
        market into a carrion-pit of extortion and a den of robbery, 
        where the poor are daily overcharged, new burdens and high 
        prices are imposed, and every one uses the market according to 
        his caprice, and is even defiant and brags as though it were 
        his fair privilege and right to sell his goods for as high a 
        price as he please, and no one had a right to say a word 
        against it. We will indeed look on and let these people skin, 
        pinch, and hoard, but we will trust in God -- who will, 
        however, do this of His own accord, -- that, after you have 
        been skinning and scraping for a long time, He will pronounce 
        such a blessing on your gains that your grain in the garner, 
        your beer in the cellar, your cattle in the stalls shall 
        perish; yea, where you have cheated and overcharged any one to 
        the amount of a florin, your entire pile shall be consumed 
        with rust, so that you shall never enjoy it.</p> 
  
<p>     And indeed, we see and experience this being fulfilled daily 
        before our eyes, that no stolen or dishonestly acquired 
        possession thrives. How many there are who rake and scrape day 
        and night, and yet grow not a farthing richer! And though they 
        gather much, they must suffer so many plagues and misfortunes 
        that they cannot relish it with cheerfulness nor transmit it 
        to their children. But as no one minds it, and we go on as 
        though it did not concern us, God must visit us in a different 
        way and teach us manners by imposing one taxation after 
        another, or billeting a troop of soldiers upon us, who in one 
        hour empty our coffers and purses, and do not quit as long as 
        we have a farthing left, and in addition, by way of thanks, 
        burn and devastate house and home, and outrage and kill wife 
        and children.</p> 
  
<p>     And, in short, if you steal much, depend upon it that again as 
        much will be stolen from you; and he who robs and acquires 
        with violence and wrong will submit to one who shall deal 
        after the same fashion with him. For God is master of this 
        art, that since every one robs and steals from the other, He 
        punishes one thief by means of another. Else where should we 
        find enough gallows and ropes?</p> 
  
<p>     Now, whoever is willing to be instructed let him know that 
        this is the commandment of God, and that it must not be 
        treated as a jest. For although you despise us, defraud, 
        steal, and rob, we will indeed manage to endure your 
        haughtiness, suffer, and, according to the Lord's Prayer, 
        forgive and show pity; for we know that the godly shall 
        nevertheless have enough, and you injure yourself more than 
        another.</p> 
  
<p>     But beware of this: When the poor man comes to you (of whom 
        there are so many now) who must buy with the penny of his 
        daily wages and live upon it, and you are harsh to him, as 
        though every one lived by your favor, and you skin and scrape 
        to the bone, and, besides, with pride and haughtiness turn him 
        off to whom you ought to give for nothing, he will go away 
        wretched and sorrowful, and since he can complain to no one he 
        will cry and call to heaven, -- then beware (I say again) as 
        of the devil himself. For such groaning and calling will be no 
        jest, but will have a weight that will prove too heavy for you 
        and all the world. For it will reach Him who takes care of the 
        poor sorrowful hearts, and will not allow them to go 
        unavenged. But if you despise this and become defiant, see 
        whom you have brought upon you: if you succeed and prosper, 
        you may before all the world call God and me a liar.</p> 
  
<p>     We have exhorted, warned, and protested enough; he who will 
        not heed or believe it may go on until he learns this by 
        experience Yet it must be impressed upon the young that they 
        may be careful not to follow the old lawless crowd, but keep 
        their eyes fixed upon God's commandment, lest His wrath and 
        punishment come upon them too. It behooves us to do no more 
        than to instruct and reprove with God's Word; but to check 
        such open wantonness there is need of the princes and 
        government, who themselves would have eyes and the courage to 
        establish and maintain order in all manner of trade and 
        commerce, lest the poor be burdened and oppressed nor they 
        themselves be loaded with other men's sins.</p> 
  
<p>     Let this suffice as an explanation of what stealing is, that 
        it be not taken too narrowly but made to extend as far as we 
        have to do with our neighbors. And briefly, in a summary, as 
        in the former commandments, it is herewith forbidden, in the 
        first place, to do our neighbor any injury or wrong (in 
        whatever manner supposable, by curtailing, forestalling, and 
        withholding his possessions and property), or even to consent 
        or allow such a thing, but to interpose and prevent it. And, 
        on the other hand, it is commanded that we advance and improve 
        his possessions, and in case he suffers want, that we help, 
        communicate, and lend both to friends and foes.</p> 
  
<p>     Whoever now seeks and desires good works will find here more 
        than enough such as are heartily acceptable and pleasing to 
        God, and in addition are favored and crowned with excellent 
        blessings, that we are to be richly compensated for all that 
        we do for our neighbor's good and from friendship; as King 
        Solomon also teaches Prov. 19, 17: He that hath pity upon the 
        poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will 
        He pay him again. Here, then you have a rich Lord, who is 
        certainly sufficient for you, and who will not suffer you to 
        come short in anything or to want; thus you can with a joyful 
        conscience enjoy a hundred times more than you could scrape 
        together with unfaithfulness and wrong. Now, whoever does not 
        desire the blessing will find wrath and misfortune enough.</p>
