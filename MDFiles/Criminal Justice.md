The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) affirms the 
fundamental principles of  the U.S. criminal justice system such as due 
process of  law and the presumption of  legal innocence. Yet, this church 
hears people’s cries that reflect the current system’s serious deficiencies. 
Drawing from the biblical witness to God’s wondrously rich forms of 
love and justice, we are compelled by a “holy yearning” to address the 
need for a change in public mindset and for dramatic reforms in policies 
and practices. This statement calls upon Christians to strengthen or take 
up ministries of  compassion and justice. Drawing on evidence and data, 
it affirms some current efforts at improving the system while identifying 
numerous other reforms that urgently need implementation.

Summary of key points	
	
	
	
	
	
•	
The ELCA is prompted to speak and to act because so many cries 
of  suffering and despair emerge from the criminal justice system 
— from victims, the incarcerated, their families, communities, those 
wrongly convicted, they who work in the system — and have not 
been heard.
•	
Drawing from Holy Scripture, this church holds up a vision of 
God’s justice that is wondrously richer and deeper than human 
imitations and yet is a mirror in which justice in this world, God’s 
world, must always be assessed.
•	
In assessing the current system, the ELCA gives thanks for its 
principles and orientation toward justice. This church recognizes 
many in the system who serve their professional vocations with 
competent and humane performance. Yet, this statement recognizes 
serious deficiencies. An underlying punitive mindset, budgetary con-
straints and persistent inequalities based on race and class frequently 
challenge its basic principles and impose significant costs on all 
involved in the system, and on society as a whole.
•	
Christians are called to confess that we, as individuals and in our 
common life together, often have fallen short in responding to 
criminal justice — both in response to crime’s harm and to prob-
lems in the justice system. 
•	
Guided by historic “marks” of the church, the ELCA is called to re-
newed ministry on behalf of those whom the system affects: victims 
of crime and their families, the incarcerated and their families, af-
fected communities, those who work in the system, and many others.
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
3
•	
Through ministry with and bearing the burdens of those in the crimi-
nal justice system members of  this church can respond wisely 
through four practices: hearing the cries, hospitality, accompaniment 
and advocacy. 
•	
The ELCA supports positive trends for reform such as greater 
emphasis on victims’ rights and needs, use of  restorative justice, 
community-based alternatives to incarceration, legislation that re-
duces sentences for certain offenses, the emergence of  specialized 
courts, and the growing emphasis on reentry. These efforts should 
be funded and supported adequately.
•	
Because mass incarceration causes significant harms, both personal 
and social, the ELCA strongly urges those who make and administer 
correctional policies to take all appropriate measures to limit the 
use of  incarceration as a sanction for criminal offenses. Toward that 
end this statement identifies three specific paths: pursue alternatives 
to incarceration, reform sentencing laws and policies, and closely 
scrutinize national drug policy.
•	
Four other imperatives also require vigorous action from policy 
makers: the criminal justice system must acknowledge the dispari-
ties, and address the implicit and explicit racism that persists within; 
it must recognize the special needs of  juvenile offenders; it must 
stop the privatization of  prison facilities; and finally, it must foster 
the full reintegration of  ex-offenders into community.
•	
A fundamental transformation of  mindset about criminal justice is 
required that challenges the logic equating more punitive measures 
with more just ones. Individuals must be held accountable, but every 
person in the criminal justice system deserves to be seen and treated 
as a member of  human communities, created in the image of  God 
and worthy of  appropriate and compassionate response.
•	
To God we owe thanks for human reason and its abilities to discern 
— with compassion and wisdom — how human communities might 
reflect at least the justice of  the law. “For what does the LORD 
require of  you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk 
humbly with your God?” (Micah 6:8).

A Social Statement

I. Introduction	 	
	
	
	
	
	
	
As this statement is adopted, one in 34 adults in the United States is 
under some form of  correctional control1 and more citizens are impris-
oned as a percentage of  the population than in any other country on 
earth, even those with comparable crime rates.2 The U.S. spends 60 bil-
lion dollars every year for corrections alone3 and they who work in the 
criminal justice system often feel stressed to the breaking point. People 
of  color and people living in poverty are disproportionately harmed 
by problems within the system. Concerned that so many cries — from 
victims, the incarcerated, their families, communities, those wrongly 
convicted, those who work in the system — have not been heard, the 
ELCA is prompted to speak and to act.
As members of the body of Christ and as citizens who seek to strengthen 
communities, we, the ELCA are both freed and called in Christ to serve 
the needs of the neighbor and to work for justice and peace in all the 
world. Seeking God’s just will for the world requires continual theological 
and moral discernment and deliberation.4 As in 1991 or 1994 when the 
ELCA addressed questions about the death penalty5 or causes of crime6 
this statement is the product of such seeking and an invitation both to 
ongoing discernment and to action for the sake of our neighbors. 
The ELCA speaks in this statement from among and to its members, 
to those affected by crime in any way, and to those who work for the 
public good in various civil offices related to the criminal justice system. 
Drawing from Holy Scripture, this church holds up a vision of  God’s 
justice that is wondrously richer and deeper than human efforts and yet 
is a gauge against which justice in this world, God’s world, must always 
be assessed (Amos 5:24).
Conscious of  the limitations of  all human aspirations and institutions, 
this church also seeks to draw on the best of  human reason to join with 
many others in calling for urgently needed reform. Both Scripture and 
reason are vital to the integrity of  the church’s witness in the world. 
This church desires the achievement of  greater justice in the U.S. crimi-
nal justice system and maintains that such an achievement is possible. 
This statement devotes significant attention to reform and calls for a 
dramatic shift in public discussion about criminal justice. The dominant 
public view, underlying the current system, equates more punitive mea-
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
5
sures with more just ones. The limited success of  massive incarceration 
in deterring crime7 has not affected the prevalence of  “lock ‛em all up” 
rhetoric in public debate. 
Prevalent views such as “tough on crime” rhetoric and policies make it 
more difficult to see each person involved in the criminal justice system 
as a human being. These views effectively override the conviction that 
all people are created in the image of  God and worthy of  appropriate 
and compassionate responses. A punitive mindset hinders questioning 
the logic and practices of  the current system and limits efforts to seek 
better alternatives.
This church knows that human evil is prevalent, ancient and often hei-
nous. News reports about murders, white-collar crime, political corrup-
tion, sexual assault, to name just a few, provide almost daily reminders 
of  this human propensity. The criminal justice system will move toward 
greater effectiveness overall and toward greater rendering of  justice only 
when undergirded by a mindset that recognizes each person as a valued 
human being and a member of  human communities. 
This statement, thus, recognizes the need for changes in mindset and 
policies. It urges a clear-eyed and humane perspective that can undergird 
effective long-term reform. It urges reforms supported by data and at-
tentive both to individual and social good that provides appropriate and 
flexible measures of  response to criminality in place of  stringent and 
sweeping measures of  incarceration.
A. Confession
In calling for action, however, this church and its members do not pre-
tend we are guiltless regarding either crime or the problems of  criminal 
justice. Many Christians confess each week that “we have sinned in 
thought, word and deed, by what we have done and by what we have left 
undone.”8 To confess one’s sins centers accountability and can lead both 
to the truth being told and justice being done (1 John 1:5-9). In confes-
sion God is invoked as the one who brings to human brokenness the 
fullness of  new life.
In that spirit, we as a church are called to confess that the church and 
its members have fallen short in responding to the growing problems 
of  the justice system. We ourselves sometimes have committed crimes. 
Often we have been negligent or allowed fear or bias to dictate respons-

6
es to crime. Often we have allowed the cries of  those harmed or those 
who work in the system to go unheard. Often we have been complacent 
as the burdens of  crime and the criminal justice system are borne un-
fairly, especially by people of  color or people living in poverty.
In confessing complicity in injustice, this church invokes both the judg-
ment and the wise guidance of  God. We turn to God for counsel on 
how we might minister better and more mercifully to those harmed by 
injustice. We ask God’s aid in opening our hearts to the cries of  our 
neighbors, that their faces and voices might show us whom we must 
love, if  we say we love God (1 John 4:18-21). We pray for guidance to 
speak more prophetically and to strive more responsibly toward earthly 
justice. 
B. Marks of  the church
Martin Luther calls Confession a “mark of  the church” one of  seven 
indicators that illustrate the fundamental character and practices of  the 
church. He also describes Compassionate Suffering as another kind of 
external mark whereby the Holy Spirit sanctifies the church in rela-
tion to the neighbor. These “marks of  the church” serve throughout 
this statement as critical indicators of  genuinely Christian response to 
today’s criminal justice system and to the people involved in it.
II. Assessing the system	
	
	
	
	
	
Contemporary societies establish the definition of  crime through a body 
of  laws that apply to all citizens. Crime is committed when a person 
breaks laws or rules for which a governing authority prescribes punish-
ment, upon adequate proof  of  guilt. Laws and the system they create 
are subject to change over time and to social bias, but their purpose is 
to protect the social fabric, to provide for the wider social good and to 
prevent harm to all.
Consistent with Lutheran Confessions, the ELCA teaches that civil 
government is a gift of  God for these purposes. Because an effective 
system of  criminal justice is an essential part of  any functioning civil 
government, this church affirms the legitimacy of  the U.S. criminal 
justice system and the fundamental principles to which the U.S. system 
is committed.
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
7
Among others, these include the rights to counsel and against self-
incrimination, protection against illegal search and seizure, trial by jury 
and the presumption of  legal innocence.
At the same time this church joins its voice with many others who rec-
ognize grave deficiencies in the current system of  criminal justice. Con-
flicting political objectives, budgetary demands, distorted media portray-
als and persistent inequalities based on race, ethnicity, gender and class, 
frequently challenge the system’s implementation of  — and perhaps 
even its commitment to — basic principles of  justice. The failure to 
achieve a well-ordered system of  criminal justice imposes grievous costs 
on everyone involved in the system, and on society as a whole.  
The most just and enduring solutions for reforming the criminal justice 
system will be built upon realistic perspectives about crime that recog-
nize the humanity of  all those involved in the criminal justice system 
and that follow principled, evidence-supported practices. Guided by 
these commitments, this church’s assessment attends to careful descrip-
tion (based on principles of  justice) and takes into account the cries 
of  those participating in the system. Each participant is a human being 
with dignity who deserves to be heard.
A. Victims of  crime
Taken on the whole it is correct to say that all crime — violent or non-
violent — does harm. Some harm is immediate while some is delayed; 
some has moderate impact while some carries dramatic lifelong conse-
quences. The harm can be physical, emotional, or financial or in varying 
combinations. Crime always tears at the personal and social trust that 
undergirds the flourishing of  human society and yet victims of  crime 
bear the most immediate injury. 
Much in the current system presumes that conviction and punishment 
delivered through a principled, depersonalized institution is an adequate 
response to the social need for justice. In many cases this may be true, 
but human beings are involved. Victims of  crime, whose needs largely 
have been ignored in the past by depersonalized institutions focused 
solely on punishment, cry out for something more.
This church affirms the need for increased attention to the rights, needs 
and interests of  victims in the criminal justice system. Those who are 
harmed by crime deserve consideration and respect throughout the pro-

cess of  adjudicating justice. In appropriate circumstances a greater reso-
nance of  justice and humanity may be achieved when forms of  personal 
interchange are practiced such as financial restitution or opportunities 
for dialog when sought by both victim and perpetrator.
B. Law enforcement 
The ELCA gives thanks for those who serve in law enforcement with 
dedication to the common good. Federal, state, county and local law 
enforcement officers daily confront troubles ranging from murder to 
domestic violence to missing pets. The ELCA recognizes that those 
who serve regularly encounter complex and stressful situations that 
take a toll on their lives and relationships. It also must be acknowledged 
that the reputation of  law enforcement has been stained by evidence of 
racial bias and excessive use of  force. 
District attorneys, prosecutors and related staff, as members of  the 
law enforcement, also serve for the purpose of  administering justice, 
maintaining public order and protecting the social fabric. The ELCA 
is troubled by evidence of  bias and other short-comings worsened by 
overwhelming caseloads even while honoring those who through their 
service strive to operate with fairness and human care. This church af-
firms ongoing efforts to deal with stresses in the system and efforts to 
train and support members of  the law enforcement system in construc-
tively responding to bias and abuse.
C. Judicial system
This church gives thanks for a judicial system that is intended to op-
erate with impartiality and accuracy in handling offenses, while also 
structured to provide legal protection against errors or overreach by 
the state. A just system is appropriately responsive to claimed violations 
of  rights of  person or property and treats all participants with equal 
respect. A system of  fair adjudication for disputed questions of  fact 
and law provides transparent processes and appropriate opportunity for 
review of  decisions.
To achieve these goals, a fair system would ensure the accused have 
meaningful access to legal counsel, fair notice of  the charges and op-
portunity to challenge and present evidence. It would provide protec-
tion of  legal rights by an independent judge, adjudication of  factual 
disputes by an impartial judge or jury and access to appellate review of 
trial court decisions. A judicial system depends on the good faith and 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
9
competent performance of all who serve vocations in the criminal justice 
system, including judges, prosecutors, defense counsel and court personnel. 
This church affirms the responsibility of citizens to serve on juries.
Achievement of these goals — impartial adjudication and protection of 
rights — also depends on adequate resources. But in many places the adju-
dicative process faces an overwhelming number of cases. This high volume, 
due largely to current national drug policy and zero tolerance policies for 
certain public order offenses, leaves little opportunity for particularized at-
tention to any case. 
Overwhelming caseloads also mean that the vast majority of cases must be 
resolved by negotiated pleas. While there are social and personal benefits 
from negotiated resolutions, this now common practice of private negotia-
tions between prosecutors and defense attorneys may be less transparent 
than what happens in courtroom trials, where communications and deci-
sions are a matter of public record. 
Over the past generation, the adjudicative process has been significantly 
affected by changes to sentencing policies. Such changes responded to con-
cerns that judicial discretion in sentencing produced unacceptable variation 
among punishments for the same offenses. This church affirms the impor-
tance of equal treatment in sentencing, but expresses concern that sentenc-
ing reform has become synonymous with increasingly harsher sentences.
D. Corrections 
Since crime is inevitable, so too is the need for appropriate conse-
quences, which require offenders to reckon with the fact that their crime 
has caused harm, and must be addressed. Genuine disagreement exists 
regarding the rationale for the forms punishment should take. Deterrence, 
rehabilitation, incapacitation, retribution and restoration are all plausible 
justifications for punishment.
Punishing offenders may serve as a deterrent to their re-offending in 
the future (specific deterrence) or to others who might commit similar 
crimes (general deterrence). Punishing offenders might serve rehabilita-
tive needs; the offenders are equipped to understand the harms they 
have caused and helped to become a person less likely to offend. 
Another justification for punishment is incapacitation. When an of-
fender seems significantly likely to re-offend and the offense would do 
A Social Statement
10
significant harm, then the offender must be prevented from harming 
again. Punishment also may have aspects of  retribution in which there is 
a legitimate concern for re-balancing of  a ruptured social order. In this 
way of  thinking, if  a human being has inflicted pain or gained an unfair 
advantage, then he or she should experience proportional pain and have 
the advantage removed. 
Finally, there is restoration. Advocates of  restorative justice suggest 
that victims, offenders and their families and communities would be 
better served when, in cases of  admitted guilt and when the personal 
and emotional safety of  victims is protected, resolution takes place in a 
facilitated conversation among these parties. Such practices have been 
especially useful in juvenile justice and in adult cases of  property crime, 
when both victim and offender willingly participate.
No single rationale or practice of  punishment is solely commendable. 
Deterrence strategies may make society safer, but they risk treating 
individuals solely as a means to the end of  crime reduction.9 Retribution 
speaks to an innate human desire to have the punishment fit the crime, 
but can easily devolve into mere vengeance.10 Rehabilitation and resto-
ration show promise to mend ruptured relationships between people 
and attend to the needs of  victims and offenders, but can reach beyond 
what the state is able, or rightly mandated, to achieve.
Reliance on one particular form of  punishment or another may be ap-
propriate in a given case, and human reason, rightly employed, can dis-
cern what is best. No single form of  punishment, however, is required 
of  necessity — and this includes incarceration. Incarceration is simply 
one strategy among many, even though it has been the one overwhelm-
ingly chosen by U.S. society. The recognition that incarceration is merely 
one option among many brings freedom to challenge the logic of  mass 
incarceration, and enables imagining and instituting better alternatives. 
Although justified in principle, all practices of punishment deserve serious 
scrutiny. As noted above, the U.S. now has the highest incarceration rate in 
the world. This has led to both overcrowding and very significant expendi-
tures on prisons — tax dollars that could justifiably be better spent elsewhere. 
Massive overcrowding contributes considerably to the dehumanizing 
problems in the U.S. prison system. Inmates fear physical and sexual 
violence from each other and staff  and worry about threats of  future 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
11
violence if  reported. Gangs often control the culture of  prisons. In-
mates are powerless in interactions with correctional staff, some of 
whom degrade inmates through language and physical intimidation. All 
inmates experience despair from lack of  control and inexpressible lone-
liness from separation. 
Massive overcrowding today worsens conditions to the point of  in-
humane treatment of  the incarcerated. Dangers to physical safety are 
real and declining health through poor conditions is likely. Cost-saving 
measures have caused some governments to contract with private firms 
to incarcerate offenders, raising many ethical questions. 
A contributing factor to inhumane conditions involves the increased 
proportion of  the mentally ill in jails and prison, currently well over 
half  of  the population.11 As the institutionalized mental illness popula-
tion of  the U.S. has been reduced by more than 80 percent over recent 
decades, many of  those released have ended up homeless or in prisons.12 
Imprisonment is not therapeutic by nature. Placement in jails and pris-
ons has the effect of  criminalizing mental illness, and puts the mentally 
ill at risk for exploitation by other inmates. The incarceration of  those 
with special needs without sufficient services contributes considerably 
to prison volatility. The ELCA has addressed the needs of  people living 
with mental illness and noted problems related to the incarcerated in its 
2012 social message “The Body of  Christ and Mental Illness.”13 
Related to mass incarcerated rates is the troubling emergence of much 
more punitive attitudes toward the incarcerated. As the population grows, 
services are being greatly reduced or eliminated, such as educational and 
recreational opportunities or access to counseling and spiritual care. 
As people of  reason, we accept differences in correctional philosophies, 
but as people of  faith we reject dehumanization of  the incarcerated 
through brutalizing means whether legal, psychological, sexual, emo-
tional, racial, cultural, or spiritual. While rational people may reasonably 
disagree about the extent and sources of  suffering, this church insists 
that some of  its forms simply must stop. These include:
•	
widespread and long-term total isolation in solitary confine-
ment;
•	
incarceration practices that sever familial ties; 
•	
trying, sentencing and incarcerating children in the adult system;
A Social Statement
12
•	
collateral sanctions that make social reintegration extremely dif-
ficult; and 
•	
severely limited access to education, counseling, mental illness 
treatment, substance abuse treatment and vocational training.
E. Confronting racism
The ELCA has long recognized that racism14 pervasively infects and 
affects all aspects of  U.S. society. Racism is central to the deep and 
abiding problems of  the current criminal justice system even though 
often unacknowledged. The extent to which inequality exists within the 
system through biased enforcement, adjudication and treatment remains 
a matter on which further discernment is needed within this church and 
this society. It is fair to note, however, that such disparities may favor 
socially privileged groups that, because of  this favor, often do not feel 
their privilege or understand its reach.
The criminal justice system encounters citizens in a long sequence. It 
begins with contact with law enforcement officers and moves through 
many stages. These include release on bond, assignment of  counsel, 
arraignment, adjudication of  the offense, sentencing and punishment — 
including sometimes incarceration — probation, or intermediate sanc-
tions. While racial disparities at any one particular point in the sequence 
may be small, and intentional discrimination may even be absent, the 
cumulative effects of  bias in the system as a whole have led to intoler-
ably destructive and long-term effects on minority communities.
Examples are many. People of  color experience statistically higher 
rates of  contact with police, a disproportion that persists even when 
other factors like age and economic status are taken into account. For 
instance, African American drivers are more likely than others to have 
their vehicles searched and to be arrested.15 Since people of  color are 
disproportionately likely to live in poverty,16  they also are less likely to 
be released on bail. Compared to those who are released before trial, 
detained individuals are statistically more likely to be convicted and to 
be incarcerated.17
People of  color are thus more likely to have a prior criminal record, 
which means they will receive harsher punishments for future offenses. 
Likewise, people of  color are more likely than Caucasians to be sen-
tenced to prison even after offense severity and the defendant’s criminal 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
13
record are taken into account.18  The cumulative effects of racial bias result 
in gross over-incarceration and punishment of racial minorities. 
Formally articulated in Freed in Christ: Race, Ethnicity and Culture, the ELCA 
teaches that racism is a sin, a violation of God’s intention that fractures 
and fragments human society.19 The full story of race in the criminal justice 
system is undoubtedly complex, but one test of the justice of any system 
is its results. The ELCA believes that present criminal justice practices and 
legislation have produced blatantly unacceptable results with respect to race.
F. Reentry	
Significant challenges and problems continue for offenders following 
release from prison. Personal obstacles make it more difficult to find and 
retain employment and to maintain healthy personal and familial relation-
ships. Some of these problems would have been real before incarceration, 
but many stem from the punishment itself.
Legal obstacles make the problem worse. Collateral sanctions are punish-
ments stemming from legislation against those convicted of crimes, and 
include limitations to employment, civic participation, housing and educa-
tional opportunities. The punitive view that underlies the trend toward mass 
incarceration continues to exercise its hold beyond prison walls. This church 
recognizes and endorses the important work of providing support and 
services to those who have been incarcerated and strongly encourages such 
ministries of accompaniment among the faithful to aid the all-important 
goal of full integration into society.
G. Immigration detention
Some point to similarities between a punitive mindset about criminal 
justice and current trends in the enforcement of immigration laws. The 
numbers of deportations and the reliance on immigration detention, 
which is often arbitrary and indefinite, have grown exponentially in recent 
years.20 Detention is a severe, under-scrutinized and expensive method of 
migration control.
Migrants in detention include asylum seekers, survivors of torture, law-
ful permanent residents and families with children. Most of these have 
not committed crimes, but are held in county jails or in jail-like facilities, 
increasingly those operated by private prison corporations, while awaiting 
either court proceedings or deportation.
A Social Statement
14
Individuals accused of  and detained for immigration violations lack ad-
equate due process and meaningful access to legal counsel. Conditions 
of  confinement are often harsh and include solitary confinement and 
minimal access to visitors. This experience can be re-traumatizing and 
isolating, particularly for individuals who are locked up far from their 
families and communities. 
The outdated and inadequate U.S. immigration system is highly com-
plex, controversial and difficult to address, both in terms of  its origin 
and in terms of  solutions. In a social message and in a social policy 
resolution the ELCA, nevertheless, repeatedly has articulated principles 
for just and wise treatment of  immigrants.21 Consistent with these 
documents, this church urges that arbitrary and indefinite detention and 
dehumanizing isolation of  migrants should be discontinued and the use 
of  humane alternatives expanded.22 
H. The church’s call 
The ELCA does not presume to have quick or easy prescriptions for 
these enduring, intractable problems, but we do call for vital and sus-
tained response. The cries of  people reflected here, the needs within 
the various systems named, and the data underlying this assessment all 
shape an urgent call for change in the criminal justice system.
In seeking to respond, this statement draws on Lutheran resources to 
explore the nature of  Christian understanding (Section III, p. 16) and 
practice (Section IV, p. 23). An adequate understanding of  matters of 
criminal justice does not depend solely on secular reason. Lutherans 
turn to Scripture for new insight, courage and strength. We also draw on 
our Confessions and historical theological reflection as well as existing 
efforts by congregations, social ministry organizations and others for 
knowledge and wisdom about what works.
This church believes that significant improvement in the criminal justice 
system is urgently necessary, economically advantageous and possible. This 
statement seeks to employ the best of human reason as a gift from God. Sec-
tions V, VI and VII, (pp. 31, 35, 39) guided by common principles and social 
science evidence, recommend pathways toward improvement. It remains 
aware of the naïveté that assumes that best intentions always lead to the best 
results. This guidance is offered in the spirit of discernment and deliberation 
for public policy, but a spirit insistent that constructive action be taken.

III. Justice and yearning	
	
	
	
	
	
A. Twofold justice and civil order
For the benefit of  spiritual life, God relates to the world through the 
gospel’s forgiveness of  sins and promise of  new and eternal life. For 
life’s many other needs, God relates through various institutions and 
communities, including civil government and its criminal justice sy- 
stem.23 God uses these systems to structure human life and, within that 
structure, to provide food, shelter, safety, education and many other ma-
terial and social benefits. Although these structures have a very different 
purpose than the gospel’s, still they are God’s great gifts to us. 
That said, there is a fundamental unity in God’s will for human flourish-
ing and yet we experience God’s divine providence in an interrelated 
twofold way. Our understanding of  justice is likewise twofold, though 
interrelated. There is a form of  justice, or civil righteousness, which we 
seek and can expect to find in the institutions of  the world. At the same 
time there is a form of  justice, or spiritual righteousness, for which we 
yearn and which we hear in the gospel and partially see in the gospel’s 
community, the church. One form must not be mistaken for the other 
even though both are interrelated with life in this world.
Judgment of crime is a characteristic of the one. Forgiveness of sins 
characterizes the other. Justice according to the law is administered in civil 
institutions by the wise use of human reason. Justice according to the 
gospel, or spiritual righteousness, however, often flies in the face of 
reason (1 Corinthians 1:21). Wisdom requires caution in determining 
which standard of justice applies in a given circumstance.
Even when focused solely within the aspect of law, the concept of justice 
defies any simple definition because it covers a wide range of contexts and 
relationships. In some contexts, justice emphasizes equity — the disinter-
ested, even-handed application of rules to each person — and the determi-
nation of eligibility for benefits or imposition of penalties. 
In other contexts, justice demands attention to differences among 
people — for instance, the distribution of  some goods according to 
particular circumstances of  need or merit. A central theme however, 
weaves together all the various dimensions of  justice. Justice speaks 
about social relations and the need to create, exercise, or restore right 
relationship between and among individuals in community.
A Social Statement
16
No matter how different the two forms of  justice are or how varied the 
dimensions, all emerge from the same root: God’s desire for wholeness 
in humankind — shalom — and for communion and fellowship with all 
that God has created. Justice must be understood in light of  God’s final 
victory (Revelation 21:1-8; Isaiah 2:2-4). The justice of  the law is neces-
sary for the world as we experience it, but will fall away in the world 
to come. In that new heaven and earth the twofold character of  God’s 
relating to the world will have run its course; only the righteousness of 
the gospel will remain.
Rightly understood, the distinctions between law and gospel, between 
the justice of  the law and the justice of  the gospel, and between tem-
poral and spiritual authority powerfully motivate Christian responses to 
injustice. Distinctions between them supply a motive for the possible 
without succumbing to perspectives that are simplistic or utopian. The 
presence and promise of  God’s reign within the brokenness of  the 
world prompts both hope and clear-eyed realism. 
B. Justice and the Easter hope
Lutherans do not articulate this twofold way of  understanding justice 
because of  loyalty to a historic “Two Kingdoms” doctrine. They rec-
ognize the distinction because it is profoundly biblical and perceptive, 
reaching back to the church’s first days. 
The kingdom of God complicated the lives of the earliest Christians. The 
cross of Christ tore open their lives to their own suffering and the suffer-
ing of others. Roman civil authorities mocked Jesus as King (Mark 15:26), 
and their wicked judgments condemned the Son of God to crucifixion. 
Yet even when the resurrected Christ appeared to his disciples he refused 
to claim any other identity than the one he had claimed on the cross. The 
risen Christ will forever be recognized only in his loving but deadly-to-
him embrace of humans in their sin and death (1 Corinthians 2:2). 
On the one hand, Christians believe that Christ has put his mark, the 
sign of  the cross, on his ruling power. Yet on the other, the power of 
Christ crucified has no more come in its completeness for us than it 
had for the earliest Christians. In brief  moments, however, the reign of 
Christ crucified comes in Baptism, in the Lord’s Supper, in preaching, in 
the forgiveness of  sin. It comes in mutual consolation and the bearing 
of  each other’s burdens, and in our bearing of  the world’s suffering. 
Unwilling to abandon the crucified King the earliest Christians took up 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
17
Christ’s cross and followed him, refusing to use coercive power over others 
(Mark 8:34-38; Luke 22:24-27). 
But they also refused to privatize their faith. Biblical witnesses testify to 
the goodness and necessity of civil order (Romans 13; 1 Peter 2:13-14). 
Christians dedicated themselves to live in the tension created by faith in 
the coming kingdom of Christ. 
This tension resulting from both the Spirit’s presence and the promise 
of God’s kingdom yet to come creates a restlessness, a yearning among 
God’s people.24 It is a tension between the perfect reconciliation of the 
world to God in Christ’s death and the day-to-day, sometimes incremental 
and sometimes monumental fixes humans apply to alleviate suffering and 
to right wrongs. The Bible recognizes this day-to-day work as God’s work. 
So should Christians.
As this church yearns for the justice of Christ’s coming kingdom, we 
listen to the cries for justice that ring out right now. Those cries cannot 
wait for our hope in Christ to come in completeness. For the sake of 
the same world for which Christ was willing to die we must be willing to 
employ power to preserve life. That power must never be used for self-
promotion, self-satisfaction or the advancement of the interests of only 
some, but used rather for the good of all, especially for those who are 
most vulnerable.
Christian faith, because it is the Easter faith, believes that justice will be 
done in that future which God holds out for the world, and to which 
the resurrection of Christ bears witness.25 A community shaped by the 
preaching of the Easter faith each Sunday will therefore be open to expe-
riencing yearning as central to the church’s commitment to justice. It will 
“teach people what they need to know about Christ.”26 
C. Justice and baptismal vocation
In Holy Baptism God forgives sin, redeems from death and grants eternal 
salvation to all who believe. God’s action initiates the Christian life and 
places a claim or mark upon us. Baptism reminds us that all have fallen 
short of living God’s will and urges humility even as it insists that no grave 
sin and no human being lies beyond the unmerited grace of God.
Lutherans also understand Baptism to confer a vocation upon the one 
baptized. The one baptized is to “care for others and the world God

made and work for justice and peace”27 through various callings in life. 
Since God desires just societies, those who serve in civil institutions act as 
God’s agents in delivering the institution’s benefits. 
In roles such as law enforcement officers, attorneys, judges, court and 
correctional staff, prison chaplains and the like, the work of God is done. 
This contribution as “doer of God’s work” holds whether or not an agent 
is aware of, or would acknowledge, such a connection. Lutheran tradition 
has affirmed that Christians may in good conscience serve in such call-
ings.28 Civil institutions could not function without those who serve in 
them, and for them and their work this church gives thanks. When their 
work is done for the benefit of all, God makes concrete the blessings of 
public order and justice through them (Romans 13:4).
When one’s role is understood as answering the baptismal vocation, a 
standard for evaluating the work done is necessarily implied. Commit-
ments to serving the neighbor as an expression of Christian life remind 
those who hold this role that their primary purpose is a ministry of loving 
service to their neighbors. Their daily work is not for their own honor, 
and when its concrete form harms rather than serves the neighbor it must 
be changed.
To designate those who exercise responsibilities in the public authority 
“doers of God’s work” neither baptizes their power in the name of God 
nor sanctifies their status quo. Instead, it expresses how crucial the justice 
of the law is, and insists it be done with appropriate dignity.
D. Justice and holy yearning 
Still, the justice of the law will never match the fullness of the righteous-
ness of the gospel. No matter how good and just our laws are, they will 
be interpreted and enforced by fallible human beings. No matter how wise 
our attorneys and judges are, incomplete evidence will be all that we can 
rely on in rendering decisions. The facts of any particular criminal case 
can never be fully known in all their detail, nor be perfectly interpreted, by 
those asked to render judgment.
Human finitude thus diminishes the forms earthly justice takes. Human 
sin also conditions the fullness that can be expected from earthly justice. 
Fear, wrathfulness, biases and innumerable other vices are present in 
crime and — often in much smaller and hidden ways — in responses to 
crime, no matter how measured and reasonable a justice system is.
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
19
As citizens of  civil society Christians are commanded and enabled to 
work for earthly justice. We feel a healthy responsibility to ensure that 
the systems of  justice our governments oversee reflect, to as deep an 
extent as possible, the key commitments of  our faith. And yet, Luther-
ans do not think that a judge rendering a verdict should necessarily cite 
Jesus’ exhortations about forgiveness or judgment (Matthew 5:38-42; 
Matthew 7:1-5). Victims of  crimes should not be counseled to deal with 
crime privately rather than reporting it to the public authority.
Nevertheless, Christians do approach questions of  earthly justice from 
the vantage point of  faith. Faith bears with it a certain healthy, relativ-
izing dissatisfaction with earthly justice. Christians see and feel a fissure 
between the righteousness of  the gospel and the justice of  the law in 
our everyday lives. We know that, as much as we long for the contrary, 
the world evoked on Sunday morning cannot quite be achieved on Mon-
day. The ELCA names this yearning as a holy gift of  God, central to our 
understanding of  justice, and thus of  the criminal justice system. 
E. Yearning and the Bible
Yearning underlies profound portions of  the Bible. Paul, for example, 
longs for the church at Philippi, and he does so with the “compassion 
of  Christ” (Philippians 1:8). By locating his emotions in Christ himself, 
Paul implies that Christ also longs for the world. Christ desires complete 
and free, mutual and loving relatedness in which all that is Christ’s is 
ours just as Christ bears in his body all that is our own, including our sin 
and death.
Christians in their longing for Christ find themselves deeply immersed 
in the sufferings of  the world. Christians are not aloof  spectators, 
watching the world’s troubles. Faith in Christ does not give special 
knowledge that trumps the reasoning power of  those leading civil insti-
tutions. Rather, faith leads us into solidarity with suffering. The groan-
ing of  creation is our groaning just as the Spirit of  God sighs our sighs 
(Romans 8:18-39). That is why we, by the Spirit and out of  faith, eagerly 
anticipate and await the justice of  the gospel (Galatians 5:5). 
Until Christ’s return, however, the Spirit of  God does not let us say: 
“justice has been done.” Our hope in the coming justice of  God makes 
us especially mindful of  victims and the isolation and dehumanization 
of  individuals convicted of  crimes, as well as shortcomings of  the sys-
tem and errors in particular judgments.
A Social Statement
20
F. Yearning and the effects of  crime
Those who have suffered from the effects of  crime find peace at the 
last, for “God himself  will be with them; he will wipe every tear from 
their eyes. Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will 
be no more, for the first things have passed away” (Revelation 21:3b-4). 
Such words are not just consolation; they also empower us to meet the 
challenges of  a world harmed by crime.
Faith relies on the promise of  God. God promises to redeem our 
losses (Psalm 34:22; Ephesians 1:7-10), and promises that in Christ we 
are reconciled to God. (2 Corinthians 5:18-19). This means that God 
promises to find a way to right all that has wronged us, and the wrong 
we have done. Victims of  crime and their families lose much. They lose 
belongings. Sometimes they lose their loved ones; sometimes they lose 
their very lives. The witness of  Easter, and the yearning it produces in 
us, recognizes that none of  this pain is lost in God. God bears all the 
suffering of  the world in God’s very being — it is God’s mark — and 
promises to make right the wrongs human beings do and undergo (John 
20:27-28; Revelation 5:6, 12).
When the vision of  the future justice God has in store for the world is 
perceived more clearly, Christians are better equipped to work for the 
betterment of  our world today. The promise of  God gives courage to 
acknowledge evil and face injustice. We know we can speak out, because 
God has spoken out, against the wickedness of  the world. The promise 
of  God gives courage to cope with partial justice; if  incomplete adjudi-
cation is all that is possible, we have recourse to the knowledge that, in 
God’s future reign, all shall be well.
G. Justice in civil institutions
In the meantime, civil institutions of  justice are essential to human 
flourishing. Even if  people were reliably unselfish and kind to one 
another, civil government would still be necessary to organize our com-
mon life. But people are not reliably good to one another. Disorder 
leaves people in fear for their person or property and often without ac-
cess to basic human needs. Effective civil government reduces such fear 
by establishing security. Freed from this fear, people and communities 
can more easily develop and enjoy the full range of  human benefits. 
Civil government contributes to human flourishing primarily through 
law, which is a gift from God. When clear rules are fairly and consistent-
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
21
ly enforced, individuals can conform their conduct to the law and trust 
that others — including the authorities — will do the same.29 Properly 
done, law enforcement, just procedures and impartial judges allow indi-
viduals to resolve their disputes through official and predictable chan-
nels rather than private conflict. They function to protect individuals 
against injustice and abuse by those who have greater economic, politi-
cal, social or physical power.
Order as such is not the sole goal of  governmental institutions, how-
ever. Ordering must be just. Reliable patterns of  human interactions 
must be formed with equal regard for the dignity of  each person. Such 
patterns as laws, programs and institutions themselves are just when 
they foster the well-being of  all. When “order” falls substantially short 
of  this goal, it becomes “disorder,” a source of  significant harm rather 
than the basis of  human flourishing.
Just ordering of  society is characterized by both principled and prag-
matic insights. It is principled in that it seeks to safeguard the individual 
against arbitrary or otherwise unfair treatment. It is pragmatic in noting 
that unjust or excessive rule may produce as much disorder as ineffec-
tive rule. Just order also can come when a deep sense of  justice leads to 
the unsettling of  established patterns of  unjustifiably unequal treatment 
or distribution of  goods.
In its constitution the ELCA pledges itself  to “work with civil authori-
ties in areas of  mutual endeavor, maintaining institutional separation 
of  church and state in a relation of  functional interaction.”30 Part of  its 
calling as one institution alongside others is to call the public authority 
to the high standards the public authority has set for itself.
The United States understands its justice system in light of the nation’s con-
stitutional mandate to “establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide 
for the common defense, [and] promote the general welfare … .” This 
church finds significant evidence that the institutions of criminal justice in 
the United States are in urgent need of reform.
Not possessing special insight into matters of  reason, this church does 
not presume to instruct the public authority how, in detail, the justice 
system should be shaped. This church does, however, urge the develop-
ment, implementation and assessment of  criminal justice procedures 
and criminal law on the basis of  human reason and principled, evi-

22
dence-based practices, and laments the absence of  such critical reason 
in many areas of  the system.
IV. Wise responses of love	
	
	
	
	
	
God calls Christian people to love and seek justice in this world even as this 
world often is confused, petty, sometimes beautiful and many times murder-
ous. Our calling surprises us and often offends us, since we are prone to think 
we do God’s work only when we analyze, remedy and distance ourselves from 
evil (Luke 18:9-14). In full knowledge of how cruel human beings can be to 
one another, and indeed have been, we, as part of God’s church are called to 
participate in God’s “Yes” to the world even as we eagerly await its — our — 
future. “Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you … was not ‘Yes and 
No’; but in him it is always ‘Yes’” (2 Corinthians 1:19).
A. Ministry and compassionate suffering
Participation in this “Yes” is marked by both ministry and compassionate 
suffering, or as Luther calls it, “the possession of the sacred cross.” The cross 
is the deepest mark of the Christian church on earth. The gospel gathers a 
cruciform people. The church believes that Jesus Christ showed steadfast love 
for us sinners despite individual and systemic wickedness, and is convinced of 
the outrageous and scandalous truth that in this act of reckless love, God is 
most fully revealed. 
To respond in gratitude with compassion and wisdom requires the ability 
both to discern the needs of another and to know what gifts lie within one-
self that could be well given to the one in need. Jesus’ own ministry was char-
acterized by abundance in responsiveness. Though Christians often feel, and 
sometimes are, diminished and powerless, still the Holy Spirit grants power 
to respond to those affected by crime and the justice system in ministries of 
compassion and mercy.
Ministering with such compassion in the face of wickedness may well lead to 
suffering. When Luther concludes his list of ways one can identify the church 
on earth, it is as if he says, “Look for the cross. Look for people enduring 
persecution, hardship, danger and death precisely because they will not com-
promise their faithfulness to God.”31 
Christians do not seek out suffering for its own sake. Rather, we seek out 
those in need, those who are isolated, those who are afraid, and those who 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
23
yearn in hope. If our seeking leads to finding, and finding to ministry, then 
we accept that burdens and ambiguity may well mark our responsive love. 
Reform of entrenched systems, merciful response to harms caused by 
crime, and the courage to face injustice will inevitably involve struggle and 
uncertainty. The exercise of baptismal vocation in the way of the crucified 
Christ risks suffering and bears burdens as it bears the mark of the cross to 
a broken and crying-out world.  
B. Responsive love in practice
This church’s ministry and mission can begin with the simplest efforts by an 
individual, by two or three gathered to serve, or by a small task force. At the 
same time ministry and mission grow and must be creative, seeking ever new 
ways of responding to opportunities and needs. As the ELCA becomes more 
aware of injustice and pain, its members are called to seek justice and to bear 
one another’s burdens compassionately and wisely. 
Such responsive love in practice will be rooted in word and sacrament 
and be expressed in liturgical forms. This church endorses the enhance-
ment of  worship materials to reach out to victims of  crime, those af-
fected by incarceration and others who are involved in the criminal jus-
tice system. It calls on its members to hold in public prayer those who 
might otherwise be “invisible” and to proclaim boldly Jesus’ declaration 
of  “release to the captive” as a sign of  God’s coming reign (Luke 4:18).
Centered in word and sacrament while seeking to respond both compas-
sionately and wisely, this church looks to the word of God and to the 
creative efforts already present in some congregations, ministry sites, synods 
and social ministry organizations. The evidence that the ELCA is putting 
into practice its convictions will be expressed by the growth of at least four 
forms of ministry and mission that rest on biblical foundations.
1. Hearing the cries
The foundational practice must be listening with compassion to the cries 
and listening for “what is really happening.” Such listening requires paying 
close attention and being truly open to the voices of those most affected by 
that system. 
This openness begins with our awareness that the cries of  those 
harmed, both by crime and by the criminal justice system, often come 
from our brothers and sisters within the church. Because fellow mem-
bers are affected by crime and the criminal justice system and because 
A Social Statement
24
this church understands itself having responsibilities in society, this church 
as a body of Christ cries out. 
Victims of  crime cry out, individually and uniquely. They can suffer physical 
injuries, financial loss, medical or psychological care costs, or the inability to 
work, as well as the loss of property. Some have deep emotional pain; oth-
ers feel emotionally numb or paralyzed with fear. Victims suffer individually 
and uniquely. 
Their families suffer alongside them and struggle to know how to help 
when resolution is often impossible. Some harmed by crime suffer again at 
the hands of the criminal justice system; they feel invisible or insignificant, 
as if their voices do not matter. Some suffer at the hands of their own faith 
communities, feeling misunderstood or ignored. Like victims, families of 
victims feel pressured by others to “move on,” leading to an even deeper 
sense of isolation. The church’s first ministry is one of listening. The temp-
tation to turn away is great. But the love that seeks justice will not let us 
turn a deaf ear to the cries.  
The families of  offenders cry out. Relationships become strained and distorted. 
Visitation is often difficult or even impossible because of distance or expense. 
While those who work in the system may not intend to willfully harm families 
of offenders, practices and policies often treat families like outcasts or crimi-
nals themselves. Families of offenders grieve, worry and struggle.
Children separated from incarcerated parents cry out. Children of incarcerated 
mothers are especially at risk. Many incarcerated mothers are single par-
ents, so their children are cared for by relatives or in the foster care system. 
These caregivers can grow weary of their changed role and live daily with 
the uncertainty of the mother’s future return. Many of those involved expe-
rience shame from having a loved one in prison.
Those convicted of  crimes cry out. This church teaches that individuals should 
be held responsible for their actions. Yet it is easy to forget that those who 
harm others are still human beings. Some have caused irreparable harm 
and may never change. Many have been victims of crime themselves. Many 
regret their crimes and yearn to make amends. Many are people of faith.
Those imprisoned for their crimes cry out. Communities must be protected 
from those who create suffering, shirk responsibility and lack regret. Yet 
incarceration brings its own forms of suffering. Isolation, loneliness, 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
25
intimidation and violence (sometimes sexual or gang-related) are very real. 
Moreover, some people are wrongly convicted of crimes, spending years 
in prison before their exoneration, release or death.
While most incarcerated people eventually return to their communities, 
the longer they are incarcerated the more ties to the community have been 
lost and the more difficult it is to return. Many return to their commu-
nities without education or job training, and thus have little chance of 
success after release. Many end up back in prison. Some give up, accepting 
life in prison despite its difficulties. Their cries — even those unvoiced — 
need to be acknowledged.
Communities cry out, especially those that have more than their share of 
crime and incarceration, leaving ever greater dismal economic prospects 
and increasingly fragile social networks. For example, public education 
suffers because teachers are reluctant to seek jobs in these communities. 
Most significantly, disproportionate numbers of men are incarcerated, 
leaving women to raise children alone and often encouraging boys to 
grow up expecting incarceration to be part of their own futures. 
Workers within the criminal justice system cry out. Many work in challenging cir-
cumstances where violence and emotional trauma are common. Most ex-
perience intense stress, yet are expected to respond to tension or violence 
calmly. Their professional challenges are rarely recognized or respected. 
Police regularly manage the stress of dangerous and unpredictable situa-
tions, and are expected to intervene rationally and maintain a professional 
attitude in trying situations. Those who work in the courts desire to earn 
public trust and must balance responsibilities to many, including victims 
and offenders, families and communities. Large caseloads make it difficult 
to treat people as individuals. They rarely walk away from their work unaf-
fected since they bear the burden of knowing the potential consequences 
of rendering a verdict or sentence. 
Correctional staff, administrators, counselors and chaplains face tense and 
demanding conditions. Those who work in victim services programs listen 
daily to painful stories and struggle to keep their own emotional balance.
Citizens and taxpayers also cry out. An increasingly litigious society has sent 
legal costs skyrocketing and diminished the system’s efficiency. Unequal 
access to legal representation contributes to a sense of  “justice for sale” 
A Social Statement
26
to those with the means to pay for the fullest possible legal defense. U.S. 
drug policy has led to massive increases in the budgets of  law enforce-
ment agencies and prisons to house those convicted of  crimes.
2. Hospitality 
Hospitality is riskier than hearing and seeking to understand. Factual 
understanding searches for dependable, predictable patterns in nature 
and human experience. But hospitality opens a door to another person, 
even a stranger who out of  the blue asks for our protection. Hospitality 
invites another, figuratively or literally, into our private space and opens 
our lives to the possibility of  new expectations and experiential under-
standing. The guest inevitably confronts us with something new, some-
thing we cannot reduce to our prior experiences, our nature, or what has 
worked for us in the past. 
From Abraham and Sarah (Genesis 18:1-10) to the later writings of  the 
New Testament (Hebrews 13:2) we read about God’s people honoring a 
sacred obligation that binds the host to the protection of  the guest. In 
these stories, though, there is something more than the discharging of  a 
duty because those who welcome others are open to the future, and thus 
make room for surprises. Risks may come when opening the door to 
that which is new, but the Bible also emphasizes the creativity that flows 
from taking the risk (Luke 24:28-32). How must the church welcome the 
stranger today?
As we turn to that question and the gift of  hospitality, we must be ever 
mindful of  another calling. The injunction to hospitality is profound 
and must be practiced with equally profound recognition of  the church’s 
care for the vulnerable in its community.32 Most importantly, congrega-
tions that contemplate allowing anyone who has been convicted of  a 
sexual offense or who the congregation believes may present a danger 
to children or others should prayerfully realize that we also are called to 
protect the innocent and vulnerable.33  
When relating to those who present such a concern, congregations 
should act with extraordinary care. If, after consultation34 and prayerful 
consideration, the congregation determines that participation in con-
gregational activities is appropriate, the congregation should create and 
follow carefully written agreements with these individuals. There should 
be disclosure to the congregation, vigilant oversight and compliance 
with the written agreement. 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
27
This protective duty is not limited to minors, but extends to others within 
the community such as the elderly or disabled, who may be vulnerable to 
abuse, whether sexual, emotional, physical, financial or other types. Specif-
ically it includes financial protection for congregations. Persons convicted 
of financial crimes or known to have been involved in financial miscon-
duct should not be given responsibility for congregation funds.
With those considerations in mind, we return to the question: how must 
the church welcome the stranger today? In creative obedience to this 
biblical mandate, many congregations and social ministry organizations 
have found ways of  extending hospitality to those affected by crime and 
the criminal justice system. Such ministries include: 
•	
being a place of  healing for victims of  crime and their families. 
Support can come in the form of  emotional aid, material assis-
tance, helping them to understand what happened to them and 
what it means, and helping them to regain a sense of  empower-
ment and autonomy in their lives. 
•	
welcoming former offenders into worshiping communities. All 
people come as sinners equal in unworthiness to receive the 
forgiveness of  sins, life and salvation that God grants through 
word and sacrament.  
•	
providing assistance to former offenders. Ex-offenders need job 
training and placement, emergency and educational assistance, 
counseling, (including substance abuse counseling), legal coun-
sel and housing.
•	
mentoring those under correctional control. Congregations can 
provide spiritual guidance, Christian fellowship and support, 
and personal motivation and challenge.
•	
supporting the families of offenders. Congregations can respond 
in ways that enhance family relationships, such as providing trans-
portation for visits, creating activities for children and inviting 
families to congregational activities that give respite to caregivers 
and positive interaction for children. In addition to being intrin-
sically good, ministries that foster relationships with offenders 
reduce the likelihood for self-harm, suicide or other harms.35

supporting those who work in the criminal justice system. Work-
ers in the system need support in their work responsibilities as a 
baptismal calling and as vital on behalf of the wider public.

creating safe places for significant conversation and discernment. 
Conversations on emotionally charged moral topics, like those 
related to the criminal justice system, can be extremely difficult. Lu-
theran congregations, committed to the rule of love, should adopt 
practices of moral discernment that are thoughtful yet open to 
lively interaction and grounded in mutually agreed upon guidelines.
3. Accompaniment
The third response moves beyond hospitality to accompaniment. The 
ELCA understands accompaniment as walking together in solidarity that 
practices interdependence and mutuality. In response to God’s call to 
comfort God’s people (Isaiah 40), we can live out our baptismal vocation by 
accompanying those who suffer from crime and its effects. Along the way 
we share their pain and fear. Jesus Christ enjoins such accompaniment and 
the opportunities are many (Matthew 25:31-46).
Congregations can be effective in expressing solidarity with victims of 
crime and their families. Whether it is providing a safe space for their story 
to be told, or working to secure safe housing for a victim of abuse, or 
organizing transportation for someone in need, the congregation is a key 
site where our hands do God’s work. This church commits itself to holding 
up in prayer those who struggle and suffer after crime has been committed, 
and will work to discern more ways to actively practice accompaniment in 
the faith it cherishes.
The ELCA recognizes prison ministry as especially needed at present and 
encourages those in or preparing for rostered ministry to consider serving 
in this way. Many jails or prisons work with local pastors and other religious 
leaders willing to provide spiritual services for inmates and staff. The incar-
cerated population has increased so dramatically in recent years that staffing 
and conditions have not been able to keep pace. 
As beloved children of God, individuals who are incarcerated are in need 
of accompaniment and of receiving the gift of the gospel in word and 
sacrament. They also need to experience dignified ways of relating to other 
human beings that are not destructive or distorted. They need relationships 
with people who are not responsible for their confinement and appropriate 
relationships with those who are.
As beloved children of  God, incarcerated Christians also can accom-
pany one another as they face together the challenges of  imprisonment. 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
29
Through prayer, worship and mutual support, they give witness to Christ’s 
claim: “where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there among 
them” (Matthew 18:20). The need and potential for creative ministry inside 
correctional facilities is great.
This church is grateful for its prison chaplains and prison congregations in 
their proclamation through word and sacrament of good news for all peo-
ple. In their daily lives as counselors and advocates, chaplains and pastors 
accompany people who are incarcerated. Those ministering within prisons 
have the opportunity to share concern for the humanity of each inmate and 
have critical roles in protecting First Amendment rights. 
Synods, congregations and individuals are urged to support and join in 
ministry to those incarcerated. Congregations should consult the local 
institution in question but can remember imprisoned people in prayer and 
by providing “care packages” via prison chaplains and pastors. Visitation 
or writing prisoners can change lives. Through Bible study, advocacy and 
— most importantly — relationships, the accompaniment that evokes the 
righteousness of the gospel can be made real. 
4. Advocacy
In seeking to remedy harm this church is called to hear the cries, to show 
hospitality and to accompany, but compassion calls for more. Compassion 
leads to seeking justice in the relationships and structure of society. Just as 
God seeks justice in this world, so church members, chaplaincies, congrega-
tions, social ministry organizations, synods and churchwide ministries must 
not be satisfied merely to react to injustice, but must also work proactively 
in the promotion of justice for all.  
Seeking justice demands that we become advocates for those whose cries 
are ignored. Victims of crime often feel unable or unsafe in expressing their 
concerns and needs. Those who are incarcerated are cut off in many ways 
from communicating with others. Those most likely to be harmed by the 
criminal justice system are in many cases the ones with the least political 
and economic power. Advocacy is essential.
Christians are called to be active participants in civil government. As citi-
zens we have the responsibility to vote and to participate in civic discourse 
about the criminal justice system. As participants we seek to affirm where 
appropriate but also to be critics of earthly, temporal jurisdictions. Properly 
distinguishing between what is promised in God’s coming reign of justice 
A Social Statement
30
and our current criminal justice institutions enhances, and does not thwart, 
passionate efforts to bring about what is possible in our political reality.
Support for public policy advocacy groups is vital. The ELCA urges its 
members to initiate, organize and support broad-based efforts to re-orient 
the present criminal justice system away from retribution alone and toward 
preparing individuals for re-entry into our communities. Fear, racial preju-
dice and economic disparities too often drive public response. Christians 
are called to support both officials who prioritize sensible, rational and 
equitable approaches to criminal justice and public policies that are just and 
effective. 
C. Burden bearing
Through ministry of hearing the cries, hospitality, accompaniment and 
advocacy the compassionate suffering of the cross becomes evident as 
Christians increasingly bear other’s burden (Galatians 6:2). Bearing the cross 
inevitably moves Christians toward actual identification with the victim, the 
criminal, the justice system worker. Wearing the mark of the cross we leave 
distance and the safe familiar behind; we begin to count the experience of 
others as our own. 
We are Ruth who pledges herself to Naomi (Ruth 1:15-18). We imitate God 
(Ephesians 5:1) who is not satisfied only to have made us but pledges to 
carry us as well (Isaiah 46:3-4). When we bear what weighs down another’s 
life, we fulfill the law of Christ who himself has carried our sin and death in 
his body. When this church bears such burdens we become a “Yes” to oth-
ers as a response to God’s “Yes” to us.
V. Paths to greater justice: positive trends	
	
	
	
The practices of  responsive love seeking justice means this church 
also must attend to public policy because human needs are addressed 
through systems. In the following three sections this church identifies 
and calls for consideration of  recommendations grounded in evidence 
and aimed at humane, effective change. These seem worthy of  support 
whether requiring legislative reform, budgetary prioritization, volunteer 
efforts or other forms of  enactment. 
Despite deep and abiding problems in the criminal justice system, it is 
important to acknowledge positive trends that have emerged in recent 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
31
years. The ELCA supports trends such as greater emphasis on victims’ 
rights and needs, use of  restorative justice, community-based alterna-
tives to incarceration, legislation that reduces sentences for certain 
offenses, the emergence of  specialized courts and the growing emphasis 
on reentry programming. 
A. Victims’ rights
As a result of  the efforts by advocates for reform, all 50 states now have 
legislation establishing the rights of  victims. While more must be done 
to develop victim-sensitive practices, these rights typically include:
•	
the right to fair treatment, dignity and respect; 
•	
the right to be informed about court proceedings and victim 
services and rights; 
•	
the right to be present at legal proceedings;
•	
the right to a voice at sentencing and at proceedings involving 
offender release; and
•	
the right to restitution from the offender.
More than 30 states also have passed constitutional amendments deal-
ing with victims’ rights, though circumstances and quality vary widely 
from state to state. At the federal level, legislation such as the Victims 
of  Crime Act (1984) and the Justice for All Act (2004) have established 
victim rights and services such as victim compensation funds.36
B. Restorative justice
Restorative justice focuses on crime as an offense against human indi-
viduals and a community rather than simply as against “the state.” While 
not denying the state’s role or the appropriate place of  retribution, 
this approach encourages victims to take an active role in responding 
to crime and invites offenders to take personal responsibility. Restor-
ative approaches seek to bring together the victim, offender and other 
members of  the community harmed by crime to develop a plan to try to 
repair that harm. 
Since the 1980s the use of  restorative responses to harm has increased 
in the U.S. These responses include victim-offender mediation, family-
group conferencing, circle process and community reparative boards. 
Restorative practices are used primarily with juvenile offenders, but 
sometimes with adults, and could be much more widely practiced. As a 
A Social Statement
32
response it offers both a diversion strategy for relatively minor offend-
ers and a supplement to the sanctions of  the criminal justice system for 
more serious offenders.
Restorative justice, in its attention to the people involved, provides a 
fuller account of  the nature of  justice as well as creative alternatives to 
incarceration. This church notes that congregations could consider be-
coming host sites for restorative training and programs. Likewise, indi-
viduals are encouraged to consider participating in restorative practices 
by becoming trained facilitators, community participants and advocates 
in both diversion programs and correctional facilities.
C. Alternatives to incarceration
Since 2000, many states have expanded their use of  community-based 
corrections for offenders who do not pose great danger to society; this 
especially includes drug offenders.37 These alternatives to incarceration 
include intermediate sanctions such as home confinement, electronic 
monitoring, halfway houses, residential work-release centers, day-
reporting centers, intensive probation supervision as well as treatment 
and diversion programs for drug offenders.38 Such approaches should be 
encouraged and funded.
In recent years community-based alternatives also have been used more 
extensively in some states to reduce the number of  probation and parole 
revocations that result in incarceration. Several states have decreased 
prison populations by enhancing parole consideration for incarcerated 
individuals.39 Some parole agencies have developed graduated sanctions 
as alternatives to incarceration for parole violations.40
Alternatives to pretrial incarceration can reduce stress on jails and the use 
of alternative forms of pretrial release on both federal and state levels have 
been promising. The goal is to put in place pretrial supervision as well as 
evidenced-based assessments for determining conditions of release.41 
D. Sentencing reform
Since 2004, more than 20 states have enacted or proposed legislation to 
reform sentencing policies.42 These legislative changes have focused on 
several types of  reform. Primary attention has been given to increas-
ing sentencing options that divert drug offenders from incarceration 
to community-based treatment alternatives and expanding sentencing 
alternatives to incarceration for other non-violent offenders. 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
33
Other reforms have attempted to increase use of  community supervi-
sion and technological innovations such as electronic monitoring to 
respond to probation and parole violations. Some states have estab-
lished or expanded programs that divert to drug treatment those who 
commit certain drug offenses. Other states have authorized early release 
from prison to community-based housing and treatment programs for 
offenders who meet certain criteria.
These reforms often are encouraged solely on the basis of  economic 
cost. Improvement for any reason is important to the individuals 
involved, and the burden of  cost is a necessary factor for government 
to evaluate. Changes made simply for economic reasons are less likely 
to endure, however, and people of  faith also must evaluate practices in 
terms of  moral justification, that is, whether the people involved are 
harmed or aided.
E. Specialized courts 
In recent decades, specialized “problem-solving” courts have developed 
for those with drug-related and mental health problems as well as for 
veterans. With a rehabilitative emphasis, these courts address underly-
ing causes of  crime and provide treatment alternatives to punishment. 
Through successful participation in treatment programs, defendants are 
able to avoid traditional court sanctions such as jail time.43
“Drug courts” in particular have been used with success. They serve 
adult and juvenile offenders as well as parents with cases in the child 
welfare system in which parental substance abuse contributed to child 
abuse or neglect.44 The potential impact of  such courts is significant 
given the prevalence of  drug use disorders among offenders. Approxi-
mately half  of  jail inmates report symptoms consistent with drug use 
disorders prior to admission to jail.45  It is notable that about half  of 
state and federal prisoners meet criteria for drug dependence or abuse.46
In drug courts, judges, defense attorneys, prosecutors, treatment ser-
vices staff  and community corrections staff  generally work together 
to address cases. Case management typically includes risk and needs 
assessment, intensive monitoring, graduated sanctions and incentives, 
and treatment and other rehabilitative services. Though intensive moni-
toring and services are initially costly, in the long run drug courts are 
cost effective when one considers the reduced recidivism of  drug court 
participants.47
A Social Statement
34
Mental health courts and veterans’ treatment courts are less widely used 
and are underfunded, but are similar in their rehabilitative focus.48 Like 
drug courts, the potential impact of  mental health courts is significant. 
Research indicates that approximately 65 percent of  jail inmates and 
about half  of  state and federal inmates have mental health problems.49 
Female inmates are significantly more likely than male to experience 
mental health problems, and female jail inmates have significantly higher 
rates of  serious mental illness, compared to males.50 Outcome evaluations 
are still limited, but early evidence hints at effectiveness in reducing ar-
rests and jail time.51 
Veterans’ treatment courts focus specifically on mental health and sub-
stance abuse issues for military veterans who have committed criminal 
offenses.52 These issues often result from psychological stresses of  com-
bat that are not adequately addressed when military personnel return 
home.
F. Reentry programming
Since the late 1990s there has been greater emphasis on the reentry pro-
cess and recognition that transitional services are essential to successful 
reintegration into the community following incarceration. The ELCA is 
grateful for congregations and social ministry organizations that have 
developed creative efforts to provide reentry support, mentoring and 
other transitional services. Governments are encouraged by this church 
to continue funding expansion of  individualized reentry plans (based on 
systematic assessment), and provide a range of  services through coordi-
nated efforts with community agencies.53  
VI. Paths to greater justice: ending the overuse of incarceration	
The ELCA is grateful for these positive trends, while concerned that 
governments and private organizations provide sufficient funding and 
institutional support to expand and broaden their effectiveness. At the 
same time, this church is clear that many areas of  the criminal justice 
system urgently require extensive reform and sustained overhaul. The 
primary factor in making policy decisions related to criminal justice 
must be principled, evidence-based practices at all levels of  the criminal 
justice system.
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
35
One area stands far above others and deserves immediate attention: this 
society must find ways to end the overuse of  incarceration. As men-
tioned earlier, compared with other countries — along any relevant scale 
— the U.S. overuses incarceration as a response to criminality. Because 
of  the significant harms —both personal and social —caused by in-
carceration, the ELCA strongly urges those who make and administer 
correctional policies to take all appropriate measures to limit the use of 
incarceration as a sanction for criminal offenses.
To achieve the goal of decreased incarceration, the ELCA identifies three 
specific objectives: aggressively pursue alternatives to incarceration; reform 
sentencing laws and policies; and closely scrutinize national drug policy.
A. Pursue alternatives to incarceration
Since the vast majority of  individuals who have committed crimes do 
not require or deserve institutional confinement, reforms are urgently 
needed. This church encourages eliminating reliance on unnecessary 
secure detention and jail, the gateways to long-term incarceration.
The ELCA urges greatly expanded use of alternatives to incarceration and 
detention such as those commended above in its discussion of positive 
trends. This includes more use of community-based alternatives to incar-
ceration for convicted offenders, for those who violate conditions of pro-
bation or parole, for juvenile offenders, and for those detained because 
of immigration status. This church also supports more treatment-focused 
alternatives to the use of jails and prisons for mentally ill offenders. 
In particular, the ELCA encourages greater use of  pretrial release pro-
grams for individuals held in jail while awaiting trial. At midyear 2010, 
nearly 749,000 individuals were confined in local jails, most for relatively 
minor, non-violent offenses. Of  these inmates, 61 percent had not been 
convicted, but were detained awaiting trial or other court proceedings.54 
While some were denied the opportunity to post bail as a danger to 
the community or a risk for non-appearance in court, most were not. 
By one estimate, nine billion dollars are spent annually to incarcerate 
individuals awaiting trial who cannot afford bail but posed little threat 
to society.55 
Holding people in custody significantly disrupts people’s lives, and can 
result in the loss of  work, home and property. Incarceration while await-
ing trial increases the likelihood of  conviction, and stiffer sentences can 
A Social Statement
36
lead to the loss of  income for families.56 A racial and ethnic component 
is also evident, given that people of  color are disproportionately likely 
to live in poverty, and therefore are less likely than Caucasians to be 
financially able to post bail.57 
B. Reform sentencing laws and policies
Numerous sentencing policies have been adopted since the 1980s, in-
cluding mandatory minimum sentences, habitual offender laws, truth-in-
sentencing laws and sentencing guidelines. Their implementation has led 
to increases in the use of  incarceration and in the length of  sentences, 
and has limited judicial discretion in the sentencing process. 
Habitual offender or three-strike laws, for example, impose lengthy 
sentences on chronic offenders. Nearly half  of  the states have them 
and in some, the law has applied even if  the third felony conviction was 
not for a serious or violent offense.58 Mandatory minimum sentences 
that impose lengthy fixed punishments on offenders and prohibit judges 
from considering mitigating factors, have been used most extensively 
in response to drug-related offenses. In addition sentences have been 
lengthened through truth-in-sentencing laws, which target serious vio-
lent offenders and require those convicted to serve at least 85 percent 
of  their sentences. Such laws exist at the federal level and in more than 
half  of  the states.59 
This church calls for review and legislative reform of  these sentencing 
policies for three reasons. First, researchers have raised serious doubts 
about the effectiveness of  more severe sentences in deterring crime.60 
Second, the policies shift discretion from judges’ sentencing decisions 
to prosecutors’ charging decisions, which are less susceptible to public 
scrutiny and likely to be inconsistently applied.61 
Third, and finally, these policies exact enormous and unnecessary person-
al costs on offenders, families and neighborhoods, along with a massive 
demand for public resources when tax dollars are desperately needed else-
where. Lengthy sentences produced by these policies mean that offenders 
are incarcerated long beyond the point at which they would likely have 
“aged out” of crime and ceased to pose a threat to society.
C. Scrutinize national drug policy
Any comprehensive assessment of  the criminal justice system must at-
tend to national drug policy because that policy has a marked effect on 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
37
all aspects of  the system. In particular, the national drug policy bears 
significant responsibility for the dramatic increase in the incarcerated 
population. In 2010, 52 percent of  federal inmates and 17 percent of 
state prison inmates were incarcerated for drug offenses.62 As noted 
above, mandatory minimum sentences have been used extensively for 
drug-related crimes and have led to exceptionally long periods of  incar-
ceration. 
Regardless of  what future directions U.S. national drug policy takes, this 
church raises grave concerns about aspects of  the present approach. 
First, the image of  a “war on drugs” reinforces a movement toward 
more militarized policing. Although special circumstances of  extraor-
dinary threat sometimes may justify the use of  military-like tactics and 
equipment, those circumstances should not be treated as the norm and 
run counter to proven community-based methods.
Second, the national drug policy has directed substantial resources 
toward one very specific form of  criminal activity. Drug abuse can be 
devastating for individuals and communities, and the international trade 
in illegal drugs continues to cause political conflict and instability in 
many countries.
The intense focus and expenditure on drug crimes, however, may come 
at the expense of  other public needs, both within and outside the 
criminal justice system. Some of  the significant resources spent on law 
enforcement efforts could be devoted to drug treatment and drug use 
prevention efforts. Further, current law allows law enforcement agencies 
to seize and retain assets used in or gained from crime. This power may 
create an improper financial incentive for law enforcement, especially 
given the relatively sparse judicial oversight of  asset forfeitures.
Third, and finally, there is mounting and persuasive evidence that the 
war on drugs has had a disproportionate impact on people living in 
poverty and people of  color. Law enforcement practices regarding 
drug offenses often have targeted disadvantaged communities, and the 
sentencing policies regarding drug crimes have had racially disparate ef-
fects. Despite the fact that Caucasians and African Americans engage in 
drug offenses (both possession and distribution) at similar rates, Black 
people have been far more likely than White people to be arrested for 
drug offenses.63 
A Social Statement
38
Policing decisions about which neighborhoods and types of drugs should 
be the focus of enforcement efforts only contribute to these dispari-
ties. Federal sentencing policies regarding cocaine offenses offers a stark 
example of the racially disparate impact of overall drug policy. Although 
the tremendous disparity in sentence length for powder vs. crack cocaine 
offenses has been diminished in recent years, it still exists.64 
Despite broad consensus that national drug policy has been marked 
by improper use of war language, very high costs and disproportion-
ate burdens on vulnerable members of our community, there are widely 
divergent views about the proper response. Some argue for decriminaliza-
tion of the use of illegal drugs and a shift toward a public health model 
for addressing the negative effects of drug addiction and abuse. Others 
contend that some measure of criminal prohibition remains necessary to 
secure both individual and social well-being.
This church does not presume to resolve that debate. But the ELCA does 
call for close scrutiny to the full costs and consequences of drug policy. 
Those costs include the resources required to implement the policy as 
well as the costs to those who are harmed by the policies.
There are histories behind the designation of unlawful substances. Hu-
man decisions have made some substances illegal while permitting others 
and have made some substances legal in some jurisdictions or in certain 
time periods. The histories behind the construction of drug policy point 
to the role of contextual factors, including the race and class of those 
who use particular substances. Those histories should be considered when 
revisiting those policies’ harmful effects. A responsible society must ques-
tion whether the policy’s benefits are sufficient to offset those costs.
VII. Paths to greater justice: support needed reforms	 	
	
Although the problem of  mass incarceration demands immediate atten-
tion, the ELCA highlights four other imperatives that require prompt 
and vigorous response from those who make and implement criminal 
justice policies. While each deserves attention for its own sake, reforms 
in these areas also will reduce the incarcerated population significantly.
First, the criminal justice system must acknowledge the racial disparities, 
and address the implicit and explicit racism that persists there; second, it 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
39
must recognize the special needs of juvenile offenders; third, it must stop the 
privatization of prison facilities; and fourth, it must foster the full reintegra-
tion of ex-offenders into community.
A. Acknowledge racial disparities and end discrimination
The estimated prison population under state and federal jurisdiction at year-
end 2011 was 34 percent Caucasian, 38 percent African American and 23 per-
cent Hispanic.65 Yet non-Hispanic Caucasians currently make up 63 percent 
of the U.S. population, African Americans make up 12 percent and Hispan-
ics make up 17 percent.66 Percentages are greatly disproportionate for other 
peoples of color also, such as American Indians or Alaska Natives.67 Racial 
disparities appear in juvenile justice systems as well, including disproportion-
ate minority contact with juvenile justice systems.
Some argue that these numbers represent the disproportionate involve-
ment of people of color in crime. African Americans, for example, have 
high rates of involvement in crimes such as homicide and robbery that are 
punished by incarceration.68 Yet, even when these high rates are taken into 
consideration, significant disparities persist and research shows that race 
influences decision-making at numerous points in ways that disadvantage 
people of color (e.g., policing decisions regarding arrest, prosecutorial deci-
sions regarding charging, and judicial decisions regarding bail and sentenc-
ing).69 Clearly, the cumulative effects of these decisions contribute signifi-
cantly to racial disparity in incarceration. 
U.S. society has a history of, and continues to manifest racism and profound 
economic inequality. The ELCA believes actions must be taken to end racial 
disparity in practices within the adult criminal and juvenile justice systems and 
to address the issue of racial disparity. 
For example, this church expresses grave objections to patterns of racial, eth-
nic and religious profiling. Although some police departments have adopted 
robust policies to counter the problem of racial bias, discrimination remains 
and carries many harmful consequences. Profiling — whether intentional or 
unintentional — stigmatizes those who are innocent of any offense. It alien-
ates members of the public who come to view the justice system as antago-
nistic rather than as a safeguard to all people’s rights and property. Extensive 
efforts must continue until discriminatory profiling ends. 
B. Recognize the special needs of  youth offenders 
The U.S. juvenile justice system grew out of  a social reform movement 
A Social Statement
40
more than a century ago based on the principle that youth are differ-
ent from adults. Because they are still developing capacities for moral 
judgment, they may be less culpable, and more amenable to rehabilita-
tion, than adults who commit the same offense. This principle — now 
supported by a significant body of  research showing that brain develop-
ment is still incomplete at age 1870 — led to the creation of  a separate 
juvenile system that aspired to be more rehabilitative than punitive.
In recent decades juvenile justice has drifted from that initial impetus. 
The drift has been motivated by perceptions of  rising violent juvenile 
crime and perceived shortcomings in the rehabilitative focus of  juvenile 
systems. Increasingly, the juvenile system has mirrored harsher trends in 
the adult system. Community-based alternatives for at risk youth as well 
as nonviolent youth offenders remain inadequate in many communities. 
Large residential juvenile correctional facilities resembling adult prisons 
still abound and are often unsafe and ineffective. They demonstrate high 
recidivism rates and poor educational outcomes, and youth rarely leave 
prepared to succeed as adults.
Further, by the 1990s nearly all states had expanded their policies 
regulating transfer of  juvenile offenders to the adult system, permitting 
transfer at younger ages and for more offenses. States justify this expan-
sion both as a means of  more securely segregating violent or repeat ju-
venile offenders and as a means of  better directing scarce funding in the 
juvenile system toward youth who are perceived to be most amenable to 
successful rehabilitation.
Concerns about security and efficiency are understandable. It is undeni-
able that society deserves protection from youth who commit horrific 
crimes. Yet, the weakened distinction between juvenile and adult correc-
tions has done great harm. Juveniles who are prosecuted or sentenced as 
adults are ill-prepared for the fundamentally adversarial environment of 
the adult judicial process. Very little allowance is made for youths’ im-
maturity, lack of  experience, or questionable ability even to understand 
their rights. 
Youth sentenced to adult prison, compared to their peers in the juvenile 
system, suffer higher rates of physical abuse, sexual abuse and suicide.71 
They are rarely provided age-appropriate educational or rehabilitative as-
sistance. Female youth face special challenges when placed in adult correc-
tional settings.
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
41
Some might see these problems as tragic consequences of otherwise prudent 
correctional policies for juvenile offenders, but the policies themselves fail 
to promote safe communities. Most experts agree that laws encouraging the 
transfer of juvenile offenders to the adult system do not deter serious juvenile 
crime.72 In fact, there is compelling evidence that transferred juveniles are more 
likely to offend in the future than their peers in the juvenile system.73 Even 
youth who receive a sentence of probation from adult criminal court reoffend 
more often than their peers in the juvenile system.74 
Transfer practices also magnify the racial disparity in our nation’s justice sys-
tem. While Black youth represent 17 percent of the overall youth population, 
they make up 62 percent of those tried in adult court. They are nine times 
more likely than White youth to be sentenced to adult prison. Latino and 
Native youth are also transferred to the adult system and incarcerated in adult 
prisons at higher rates than White youth.75
This church supports an end to current practices of trying, sentencing and 
incarcerating youth in the adult criminal justice system as well as ending youth 
sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Recent Supreme 
Court actions reflect encouraging developments in rulings against the death 
penalty for those who committed their crimes as juveniles and against manda-
tory life sentences without parole. 
While advocating an end to current transfer practices, this church recognizes 
that some juvenile offenders pose significant risks to public safety and may 
not be appropriate for release upon reaching the age at which juvenile custody 
would cease. Reasons include insufficient progress in rehabilitation or the 
severely grievous nature of their offenses. This statement urges authorities to 
explore means of ensuring public safety without continuing the practice of 
transferring juvenile offenders to the adult system. 
Even these youth deserve initial secure placement within the juvenile system 
where they have every opportunity to benefit from rehabilitative and educa-
tional activities with their peers. Adult incarceration should take place only 
after completion of placement in the juvenile system and should be reserved 
for youths who have committed the most grievous offenses. The determina-
tion that a youth poses continuing high risk to public safety requires thorough 
objective assessment of risks and needs. 
The ELCA recognizes that the goal of keeping juveniles out of the adult 
criminal system requires the development and expansion of alternative cor-
A Social Statement
42
rectional strategies. Some states have redefined the age at which adulthood 
begins, allowing youths to remain in the juvenile system beyond 18 and 
affording them maximum opportunity to benefit from rehabilitative efforts 
in the juvenile system. Some jurisdictions have seen promise in blended sen-
tencing strategies, which allow juvenile and adult sentences to be imposed 
simultaneously. The adult sentence is typically suspended but held as a pos-
sibility in order to protect public safety.76 
At the most fundamental level, this church calls for a juvenile justice system 
that more closely matches its original rehabilitative intent and is equipped 
to meet the needs and manage the risks of all youth offenders. Promising 
initiatives for at-risk and first-time and nonviolent youth offenders include 
evidence-based therapeutic approaches for strengthening families as well 
as community supervision initiatives. Such initiatives include after-school 
programs and evening reporting centers that constructively engage juveniles 
during peak crime hours. 
For youth who have committed more serious offenses and require secure 
residential placement, some jurisdictions have developed approaches dem-
onstrating that even many serious youth offenders are amenable to rehabili-
tation. In a positive trend, some states are working to reform their juvenile 
systems by embracing those approaches.77 Until every state can meet the 
needs and manage the risks of all youth offenders within a rehabilitation-
focused juvenile system, juvenile justice reform will be incomplete.
Youth offenders should be held accountable for their wrongful actions. 
Anything less dishonors them and their budding capacity for moral 
agency. Yet, they should be held accountable in age and in develop-
mentally appropriate ways. Regardless of  their criminal offenses, youth 
deserve a rehabilitation-focused experience. Only these experiences 
provide them every opportunity to develop moral judgment, empathy 
for others and the skills necessary for making a responsible and success-
ful transition to adulthood. 
This church calls upon its members, congregations, social ministry orga-
nizations and others to take part in building new social momentum for 
reforming juvenile corrections practices and treating youth as youth. 
C. End prison privatization
Arguments used in favor of  for-profit prisons cite their supposed cost-
effectiveness, their ability to reduce overcrowding in public prisons and

the introduction of free market competition to lower incarceration costs 
overall. Recent decades have witnessed a dramatic trend toward the usage 
and spread of private, for-profit prisons.78 
The arguments against them, however, are much stronger, and, for this 
church include concerns that are theological, moral and economic. Theolog-
ically speaking, it is the role of government to restrain evil, not that of the 
market.79 Civil governments may legitimately deputize private companies to 
act on their behalf in some cases. Private entities, including many church-
related organizations, have effectively and appropriately participated in cor-
rections programs, such as halfway houses. But such community facilities 
differ significantly from prisons. Such efforts must be carefully monitored 
when private entities are entrusted with even limited coercive power over 
individuals.
Where individual lives depend utterly upon the system and as one comes 
closer to matters of life and death, it is of utmost importance that the state 
not abdicate its responsibilities. When the state incarcerates someone as a 
prisoner, it brings upon itself special responsibilities for exercising custodial 
control. For this moral reason the role of the state in the operation of pris-
ons should not be supplanted by economic players who are guided primarily 
by profit or production. The profit motive of private prison corporations is 
apparent in reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission where such 
corporations identify sentencing reform as an economic “risk factor.”80
Contracting with private firms for incarceration invites myriad offenses. Sig-
nificantly, privatization works against rehabilitation and successful offender 
reintegration into society. When a corporation’s profits depend on a steady 
flow of offenders into or back into its prisons, it has little incentive to try 
to rehabilitate those who are incarcerated. Studies have shown that cost-
saving measures in private prisons have contributed to significantly reduced 
services for the incarcerated. These reductions in medical care, education, 
job training and counseling thereby contribute to higher recidivism rates for 
those released from private prisons compared to public ones.81
Recent evidence also questions the supposed economic benefits of private 
prisons. Studies have suggested that cost savings are minimal or absent.82 In 
addition to reducing services for the incarcerated, efforts to cut costs have 
led to limited training of employees, relatively low pay rates among certain 
staff, and high turnover.83 Higher levels of violence are likely in such an 
environment. 
A Social Statement
44
On the basis of  theological, moral and economic reasons, this church 
objects to current trends of  corporate privatization in the criminal 
justice system. The ELCA urges government at every level to maintain 
or reclaim its responsibility and eliminate reliance on the use of  private, 
for-profit prisons.
D. Foster full reintegration of  ex-offenders
The dominant aim of  criminal justice is restored social order. Even 
forms of  punishment ultimately serve the goal of  restoring a sense of 
social order. A balance must be achieved, therefore, between the harsh-
ness of  punishment itself  and the return of  an offender to social life. If 
punishment is in some sense retributive, it must also be in some sense 
rehabilitative. For this reason attention to offender services and the 
successful reintegration of  ex-offenders to society matter as part of  the 
criminal justice system. 
1. Rehabilitation, re-entry and transitional support
This church holds that social order and human flourishing will be en-
hanced by greater emphasis on rehabilitative opportunities for prison-
ers. Many enter prison with limited life skills, poor job histories, little 
education and untreated drug or alcohol addictions. Upon their release 
from prison, however, they are expected to adjust to life back in their 
community (if  they have one), find work, support themselves, seek help 
for mental illness and substance abuse, and not return to crime. 
To dramatically increase chances for success, re-entry support must begin 
long before release from prison. By identifying needs such as basic life-
skill and job-skill training, education and treatment needs at sentencing, 
and then comprehensively addressing these needs during incarceration, 
the likelihood of successful transition back into the community is height-
ened. The religious dimension of life is significant and deserves to be a 
major component of rehabilitative programs for those interested.
The ELCA also supports improved programming for released prisoners 
or those with alternative sentencing. The difficulties of  finding housing, 
employment and treatment (both for mental illness and addiction) make 
an offender or ex-offender’s participation in society challenging. Men-
toring programs have shown especially encouraging signs of  success in 
aiding released offenders. Congregations and social ministry organiza-
tions have found ways to act as mentors and supporters; the ELCA 
applauds and encourages such efforts. 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
45
Yet the church also must remind the state of its duty to increase the pos-
sibility of successful re-entry to society. The main responsibility lies, finally, 
with the offender, but impediments to successful re-entry need to be 
removed to the greatest extent possible. Incentives for re-entry preparation 
should be created. If inmates successfully complete prison programs related 
to post-prison success, sentence reductions may be appropriate.
Support for rehabilitation and reentry programs alone is not sufficient. 
Current policies imposing punitive, long-term collateral sanctions also 
must be reformed for the sake of  successful re-entry and the reduction 
of  recidivism.
2. Collateral sanctions
When someone is convicted of a crime and a judge imposes the sentence, 
many invisible “collateral sanctions” are indirectly, and silently, added.84 
These punishments are defined through legislation and restrict the rights 
of ex-offenders after release. Such restrictions may include denial of the 
right to vote, restricted access to public housing, ineligibility for public as-
sistance or educational loans, and barriers to employment for their entire 
lives due both to employers’ increased access to criminal records and 
to exclusion from particular occupations.85  The stigmatization of these 
restrictions harms people personally as much as some restrictions harm 
them financially. 
Beginning in the 1980s, state legislatures and the U.S. Congress created 
legislation expanding the use of collateral sanctions. Examples include an 
increase in the number of states that permanently deny convicted felons the 
right to participate in the democratic process by voting. It is likely that many 
U.S. citizens are unaware of the existence of such legal restrictions. This 
invisibility follows because, unlike prisons, these sanctions operate largely 
beyond public view, and are imposed through law rather than by a judge in a 
visible courtroom setting.86
While some collateral sanctions are directly responsive to the risk posed by 
the ex-offender’s prior conduct, the broader trend of collateral sanctions 
does not seem to arise from those concerns. Instead, the increased use of 
such significant consequences reflects the general shift toward more puni-
tive responses to offenders and “tough-on-crime” strategies. This expansion 
has been politically popular because, unlike other forms of sanction, it has 
come at little cost to taxpayers. In that sense, there are political advantages 
to the use of invisible punishments.
A Social Statement
46
Such a narrow view ignores the consequences of  these enduring pun-
ishments that significantly impact millions of  Americans. For instance, 
there are real effects when a young man earns his GED in prison, but 
upon release is denied access to student loans for more education. The 
harms of  collateral sanctions extend beyond those convicted of  crimes 
to families and communities. In all cases, defendants and their counsel 
should be given effective ways to determine collateral consequences and 
make plea decisions with full knowledge of  those consequences.87
Although most collateral sanctions should be drastically limited, some 
are appropriate or even necessary when the sanction corresponds di-
rectly to the offense for which a person was convicted. It is reasonable 
to exclude those convicted of  financial crimes from employment posi-
tions where they would have access to or responsibility for oversight of 
funds. Serious sex offenders and all child sex offenders should not have 
access to vulnerable individuals in employment or volunteer settings. 
The majority of  invisible punishments, however, do not fit the criterion 
of  necessity, and therefore are unjust. This statement concurs with the 
action of  the American Bar Association that has called for “restrict-
ing the reach of  invisible punishment by limiting collateral sanctions to 
those that relate directly to the offense charged, and prohibiting sanc-
tions that without justification, infringe on fundamental rights, or frus-
trate a convicted person’s chances of  successfully reentering society.”88
VIII. Moved by the cries: called to respond	
	
	
	
 
Aware of  the mounting evidence of  the system’s deep and abiding 
problems, the ELCA calls for the adoption of  a variety of  reforms. The 
leading concern is to decrease the incarcerated population, but other 
reforms delineated in this statement are significant in their own right. 
At a deeper level, however, this statement recognizes that a more funda-
mental transformation in thinking about criminal justice is required. It 
calls for a transformed mindset, one that counteracts the logic equating 
more punitive measures with more just ones. This mindset challenges 
current undertones of  vengeance, violence and racism and permits 
everyone in the criminal justice system to be seen as members of  human 
communities, created in the image of  God and worthy of  appropriate 
and compassionate response. 
The Church and Criminal Justice: Hearing the Cries
47
The ELCA recognizes that retreat from unduly harsh sentencing poli-
cies and the over-utilization of  incarceration may be motivated by 
economic factors, rather than by a moral critique of  the way the system 
functions. Improvement for any reason is important to the individuals 
involved, but this church maintains that responses to criminality should 
be made on theological, moral and rational grounds as well. Changes 
made simply for economics are less likely to endure.
Today it is important to join with others of  good will to challenge the 
flawed public consensus about crime and criminal justice. Until a shift 
occurs in the public consensus, criminal justice policies likely will persist 
that recognize neither the injustice nor the inefficiency of  many of  our 
current responses to crime. 
In God we place our hope for the fullness of  shalom promised. Confi-
dent in the presence and promise yet to come of  God’s reign we yearn 
for a greater measure of  justice now. And to God we owe thanks for hu-
man reason and its abilities to discern — with compassion and wisdom 
— how human communities might reflect at least the justice of  the law. 
When reason identifies sites of  injustice in these communities, institu-
tions and systems, compassion motivates our response. The ELCA 
deeply appreciates the high ideals of  the current criminal justice system. 
At the same time this statement has noted numerous issues about which 
it must be said that justice has not been done.
The ELCA therefore recommits itself to ministry with, for, to and among 
the many, many people whose voices cry out within our criminal justice 
system. “For what does the LORD require of you but to do justice, and 
to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?” (Micah 6:8).

“Discernment” suggests a more open-ended process rooted in Scripture’s call to 
discern God’s will (Romans 12:1-2) while “deliberation” suggests a process more 
oriented toward decision, guided by a legislative model. While there is significant 
overlap in purpose and practice, each model contributes crucial aspects for moral 
reflection and action.

while recognizing that “God entrusts the state with power to take human life” 
when appropriate, the social statement opposes the death penalty because “it is 
not fair and fails to make society better or safer.” In 2002 a social policy resolution 
adopted by the ELCA Church Council encouraged a “moratoria on the use of the 
death penalty and [urged] its eventual abolition in this society.”

7 According to Marc Mauer, rising rates of incarceration between the 1960s and the 
2000s have coincided with two periods of increase in crime rates and two peri-
ods of decrease in crime rates. The rate of violent crime in 2003 was higher than 
the rate of violent crime prior to the increased build-up of prisons in the United 
States. He concludes that, at best, mass incarceration has an “ambiguous” effect 
on actual crime rates. Marc Mauer, Race to Incarcerate (Rev. ed.; New York: New 
Press, 2006), 94-95. See also John J. Donohue III., “Economic Models of Crime

and Punishment.” Social Research 74(2): 379-412, who points out that high costs of 
incarceration are far greater than the economic benefits of crime reduction through 
incarceration.

9 An important strand of ethical thought insists that each human being should 
be treated as an “end” not a “means” because of human dignity. Punishing an 
offender solely as a means to greater social safety (e.g., “making an example” of 
someone) can violate this principle.
10 Indeed, retributive punishment has historically functioned as a public proxy for 
private vengeance. If one family has been wronged by another and wants to retali-
ate, they will be less likely to do so if they feel the other family has been appropri-
ately punished by the state.
11 In 2005, 56 percent of state prisoners, 45 percent of federal prisoners, and 64 
percent of jail inmates had a mental health problem, including histories or symp-
toms of illnesses such as major depression, psychotic disorders and mania. Yet, 
among inmates with a mental health problem, only 34 percent received treatment 
after admission in state prison, 24 percent in federal prisons, and 18 percent in local 
jails. Doris J. James and Lauren E. Glaze, “Mental Health Problems of Prison and 
Jail Inmates” Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report (Washington, D.C.: U.S.

38 Diversion programs are designed to enable offenders to avoid criminal charges 
and a criminal record. Such programs might include restitution, community service 
hours, treatment or counseling.
39 These measures include increased use of good-time credits that allow earlier 
release, increased rates of release for low-risk offenders who are identified through 
the use of risk assessment instruments, and consideration of parole eligibility 
earlier in sentences. Nicole D. Porter, The State of  Sentencing 2009: Developments in 
Policy and Practice (Washington, D.C.: The Sentencing Project, 2010). Judith Greene 
and Marc Mauer, Downscaling Prisons: Lessons from Four States. (Washington, D.C.: The 
Sentencing Project, 2010).
40 In Kansas, for example, changes in community supervision policies and practices 
resulted in a nearly 50 percent decline in parole revocations for technical violations 
from 2005 to 2009. Marc Mauer, “Sentencing Reform: Amid Mass Incarcerations

43 Contrary to claims that such programs are “soft” on crime, defendants in prob-
lem-solving courts are typically required to complete more rigorous programming 
than offenders whose sentences in traditional courts are punishment oriented.

56 Studies show that those who are detained pretrial are more likely to be convicted 
and more likely to be sentenced to incarceration than those who are released prior 
to trial, even after factors such as the seriousness of the offense and the defendant’s 
prior criminal record are considered. See Walker, Spohn, and DeLone, The Color

58 In California about 8,000 third-strike inmates are serving sentences of 25 years 
to life; for almost half of these inmates, their third strike was a conviction for 
a drug or non-violent property offense. Ryan S. King, Changing Direction? State 
Sentencing Reforms 2004-2006 (Washington, D.C.: The Sentencing Project, 2007). In 
November 2012, California citizens voted to change California’s habitual offend-
er law so that the third felony offense now must be serious or violent in order to 
invoke habitual offender sanctions.

64 According to the prepared statement of Ricardo H. Hinojosa, Acting Chair, 
United States Sentencing Commission, before the Senate Judiciary Committee’s 
Crime and Drugs Subcommittee on April 29, 2009, African American offenders 
comprised 91.4 percent in 1992 and 80.6 percent in 2008; Caucasian offenders 
comprised 3.2 percent in 1992 and 10.2 percent in 2008; and Latino offenders 5.3 
percent in 1992 and 8.2 percent in 2008. Powder cocaine offenses are more com-
mon in Caucasian populations, and crack cocaine offenses in African American 
populations.

75 The meta analysis of available research demonstrates that racial disparity holds even 
when controlling for offense severity. “Out of all youth cases in adult court, African-
American youth accounted for 87% of those charged with drug offenses; 48% of 
those charged with property offenses; 59% of those charged with violent offenses; 
and 63% of those charged with public order offenses.” N. Arya, C.F., Villanueva and

76 Many experts, though, oppose blended sentencing and see it as an unsuccessful 
compromise between the juvenile and adult systems. A. Kupchik, Judging Juveniles:

Press, 2006). While the intention is to incentivize youth charged with the most serious 
offenses to take advantage of rehabilitative efforts in the juvenile system, there is

evidence of subjectivity and bias in decision-making, resulting in even more youths, 
especially those of color, being transferred into the adult system. F. Cheesman, A De-

In an SEC filing, Corrections Corporation of America wrote, “Our growth is gener-
ally dependent upon our ability to obtain new contracts to develop and manage new 
correctional and detention facilities....The demand for our facilities and services could 
be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction 
and sentencing practices....For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and con-
trolled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, 
convicted and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facili-
ties to house them.” U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Corrections Corpora-
tion of America, Form 10K for fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2005.
