A social statement on health, healing, and health care...
Caring for Health:
Our Shared Endeavor
E V A N G E L I C A L  L U T H E R A N  C H U R C H  I N  A M E R I C A
As amended and adopted by more than two-thirds majority vote (935 - 34) as a
social statement of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America by the eighth
biennial Churchwide Assembly on August 15, 2003, at Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Introduction
Health is central to our well-being, vital to relationships, and helps
us live out our vocations in family, work, and community.  Caring
for one’s own health is a matter of human necessity and good
stewardship.  Caring for the health of others expresses both love
for our neighbor and responsibility for a just society.  As a personal
and social responsibility, health care is a shared endeavor.
The Crisis in Health Care
Advances in prevention and treatment offer improved health,
cures for some diseases, and longer lives for many people.
Community investment in public health and prevention adds to the
length and quality of life for many. Medical progress promises
revolutionary benefits for our future. We are grateful for all of this.
Human beings are still finite, however, and therefore vulnerable
to sickness, injury, and death. Yet we live in a culture that often
denies death and suffering and places its faith in technology to
overcome them. Such cultural attitudes lead to increasing reliance
upon expensive curative medicine without significantly extending
life span or improving quality of life. They also too often leave
individuals to struggle alone with the ethical challenges raised by
advances in medicine.
Health care in the United States, its territories, and Puerto Rico
suffers from a prolonged crisis. People unnecessarily endure poor
health. Rising health care costs leave a growing number of people
without adequate health care. Health care resources often are
rationed based on ability to pay rather than need. Finding access to
2
quality health care services is difficult for many. The growing
number of elderly people adds another stress on health care
resources. Fear and self-interest defeat social justice in the political
processes of health care reform.
The stress on individuals and families because of society's inability
to fashion an adequate health care system makes action increasingly
urgent. The breadth and complexity of the challenges require serious
conversations and bold strategies to establish the shared personal
and social responsibilities that make good health possible. The health
of each individual depends on the care of others and the
commitment of society to provide health care for all.
The Church and the Health Care Crisis
The Christian Church is called to be an active participant in
fashioning a just and effective health care system. Responding to
those who were sick was integral to the life and ministry of Jesus
and has been a central aspect of
the 
Church's 
mission
throughout its history. Health
care and healing are concrete
manifestations of God's ongoing
care for and redemption of all
creation.
We 
of 
the 
Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America
have an enduring commitment
to work for and support health care for all people as a shared
endeavor. Our commitment comes in grateful response to God's
saving love in Jesus Christ that frees us to love and seek the well-
being of our neighbor. It is shaped by the witness of Scripture—
including the ministry of Jesus—and the Lutheran Confessions,
together with the Christian Church's historical and contemporary
ministry in healing and health. Our commitment draws upon God-
given abilities to understand our situation and discern our response.
As members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, and
as a corporate body, we support:
a comprehensive approach to health care as a shared endeavor
among individuals, churches, government, and the wider society;
a vision of health care and healing that includes individual,
church, and social responsibilities;
We of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America
have an enduring commit-
ment to work for and support
health care for all people as a
shared endeavor.

a vision of a health care system that is based on understanding
health, illness, healing, and health care within a coherent set of
services;1
equitable access for all people to basic health care services and
to the benefits of public health efforts;
faithful moral discernment guiding individual participation and
public policymaking in health care services.
God continues to call the Church—its institutions and believers—
to work in society for individual and collective actions that promote
health and ensure care for those who suffer. Understanding health
care as a shared endeavor compels the Church and all people of
good will to join in efforts for change.
Biblical and Theological Perspectives
Health
God creates human beings as whole persons—each one a dynamic
unity of body, mind, and spirit. Health concerns the proper
functioning and well-being of the whole person. A Christian
perspective on health, therefore, shares the concern of the apostle
Paul that “our spirit and soul and body be kept sound and
blameless” (1 Thessalonians 5:23). This understanding of human
wholeness means that concern for health should attend to the
physical, mental, spiritual, and communal dimensions of a person’s
entire well-being. Health is good for its own sake; it also is good for
living abundantly in relationship with God and in loving service to
our neighbor in the vocations to
which God has called us.
Because human beings are
mortal, suffering and death are
a part of life. Perfect health
eludes us. Although health
depends in part on individual
behavior, it is also to a
significant degree beyond
individual control. Many factors
contribute to health or its absence: genetics, physical and social
environments, individual behaviors, and access to care.2

vocations to which God has
called us.

Because of our sinful nature, we often turn in on ourselves and
away from God and neighbor. We frequently become unfaithful
stewards of our health, tending at times to disregard it and at other
times to idolize it. Sin also corrupts our social systems and
relationships in ways that directly and indirectly threaten health.
We see sin at work in the environmental damage, poverty, social
isolation, discrimination, oppression, and violence that degrade
health and the relationships necessary to support it.
When we understand health in this larger context, we realize that
we cannot be healthy by ourselves. We help each other attain good
health through our ways of living together and through supporting
those who provide all forms of health care services and healing.
Health care, therefore, must be a shared endeavor.
Illness
Those who are ill experience a loss of well-being or wholeness.
Illness disrupts lives, limits activities, disturbs relationships, and
brings suffering. Illness may bring one closer to God and neighbor,
but not always. People with serious or chronic conditions may
experience their own bodies or mental states as lacking wholeness
and unity. Some may even feel as if their bodies or minds are beyond
their control.3 They may feel isolated from others. Ultimately, ill
persons may even feel separated from God. They may labor to
understand their suffering, as the psalmist did: “O Lord, why do
you cast me off” (Psalm 88:14); “I am shut in so that I cannot escape”
(Psalm 88:8); “my companions are in darkness” (Psalm 88:18).
Healing
Healing is restoration of wholeness and unity of body, mind, and
spirit. Healing addresses the suffering caused by the disruption of
relationships with God, with our neighbors, and with ourselves. It
involves curing when possible, but embraces more than cure. When
we limit illness to disease and health care to cure, we miss the deeper
dimensions of healing through restoration to God.
The Scriptures speak powerfully about healing. At the beginning
of Israel’s history, God announces, “I am the Lord who heals you”
(Exodus 15:26). God promises to come at the end as “the sun of
righteousness . . . with healing in its wings” (Malachi 4:2).
Ultimately, God will heal all who call upon the divine name. God
will “swallow up death forever” and “wipe away the tears from all
5
faces” (Isaiah 25:7-8; see also Revelation 7:17). When the Bible
speaks of healing, it frequently anticipates this “perfect health” that
God holds in store for people through faith in Jesus Christ (Acts
3:16). In such passages healing includes curing, restoring, saving,
forgiving, transforming, achieving peace, and gaining victory over
death itself. God’s healing, however, is not limited to the end of life
or time. The Bible also proclaims a God who heals illness and cures
diseases in the present time—the healing of the sick and the
alleviation of suffering that all people seek in their everyday lives.
The triune God heals within and through the work of creating,
redeeming, and sustaining humankind. God the Creator heals
through the natural processes of the body and is active in the work
of healers everywhere. Human healing activities in all their variety—
medicine and other biomedical technologies, cultural and religious
practices, governmental and social organizations, human behavior
and decisions—can be avenues of healing blessed and empowered
by God. Because human beings are finite, none of these activities
will produce perfect health; because of sin, each of them can be
abused. Nevertheless, God gives us curiosity and intelligence, skills
and talents to enable us to meet our responsibilities for our own
health and for the social and physical environments that affect our
health. This traditional Lutheran understanding leads us to give
thanks for God’s healing work in and through creation and human
vocation.4
God’s redemptive work also includes a healing dimension. The
New Testament proclaims Jesus as the incarnate presence of God
and thus the Savior and healer of all. The Gospels introduce Jesus
as a healer (Matthew 4:23-25) and are filled with stories of his
forgiving and healing work. Jesus healed because in him was the
full presence of God, and we continue to proclaim the forgiving
and healing presence of Christ in Word and Sacrament. Offering
hope of the resurrection to come, Jesus continues to stand with us
in our illness and suffering with his healing presence. We give thanks
that our final healing, salvation from sin and death, has been won
for us irrevocably in Christ’s death and resurrection.
God’s healing comes through the Holy Spirit who heals, sanctifies,
and transforms through a variety of gifts. In and through the
Church, the Holy Spirit works to heal through the ministry of Word
and Sacrament, intercessions and liturgies for healing, prayer and
the laying on of hands and anointing with oil, pastoral care and
6
servant ministries, the mutual consolation of Christian sisters and
brothers, and congregational and church-related health ministries
that reach out to all people.
The healing work of the triune
God is the basis for the Church’s
commitment to good health,
healing, and health care. God
gives us health and healing
within the community of
relationships on which we
depend as creatures. This
community, though broken,
God restores in Jesus Christ. Our calling to be faithful stewards of
our own health and to fulfill our obligations for the health of others
comes from the God who heals and redeems the whole creation.
Health Care
Health care is a shared endeavor. Just as each person’s health
relies on others, health care depends on our caring for others and
ourselves. Broadly speaking, the term “health care” encompasses
the wide range of services used to treat symptoms or diseases or to
maintain health. Patients and caregivers are more than consumers
or providers; they are whole persons working together in healing
relationships that depend on and preserve community. Although
health care goods and services may be bought and sold, health care
is above all an activity of caring that grows out of relationships of
mutual responsibility, concern, and trust—and that cannot be
reduced to a commodity.
Regardless of the means used to provide health care and ensure
access to it, we must diligently preserve the nature of health care as
a shared endeavor. This means that we recognize our mutual
responsibilities and guard against the ways in which motivation to
maximize profit and to market health care like a commodity
jeopardizes health and the quality of health care for all.
“Being well” for Christians does not mean we are untouched by
pain and suffering. Human beings are finite and vulnerable, and so
we recognize limits on what we expect of health and health care
for our families and ourselves. “Being well” means that we
participate in Christ’s own “greater love” (John 15:13) by giving
ourselves for others and sharing their suffering in response to Christ
Our calling to be faithful
stewards of our own health
and to fulfill our obligations
for the health of others
comes from the God who
heals and redeems the whole
creation.

who bore the suffering of all. Like the good Samaritan, we are to
bandage the wounds of our neighbor in need of healing, whoever
the neighbor may be (Luke 10:29-37).
A Vision of Health Care and Healing
as a Shared Endeavor
In light of these biblical and theological perspectives, we address
the health crisis in the United States with its disjointed health care
services, its high costs of treatment, and its failure to provide access
for many. Although necessary, piecemeal efforts to reform health
care without a clear goal will be inadequate to the task. We offer a
vision of health care as a shared endeavor that builds upon the
basic dimensions of health, illness, healing, and health care in
relation to the interdependent responsibilities that must be
addressed if progress toward better health care is to be achieved.
Personal Responsibilities
Each of us has responsibility to be a good steward of his or her
own health out of thankfulness for the gift of life and in order to
serve God and the neighbor.
This means taking effective
steps to promote health and
prevent illness and disease (for
example, eating well, getting
adequate exercise and sleep,
avoiding use of tobacco and
abuse of drugs, limiting alcohol,
and using car seat restraints). It
means balancing responsibility
for health with other responsibilities. It also means seeking care as
needed, recognizing that disability, disease, and illness do occur,
even to those who are good stewards of their health.
Health is a blessing from God. It is good and proper that we attend
to our health and healing; however, we show sin's power when we
become unduly absorbed in our own selves and make health an
idol by denying our own mortality. The temptation to make health
our god may show itself in excessive preoccupation with physical
appearance and a denial of aging or the inevitability of death. It
also may lead us to demand unlimited resources for services that
go beyond responsible stewardship of good health.
Each of us has responsibility
to be a good steward of his or
her own health out of thank-
fulness for the gift of life and
in order to serve God and the
neighbor.

Patients and health care professionals share responsibility to use
health care resources wisely. Simply because a treatment or
procedure exists does not mean that it should be used in every
instance. The patient, family, and health-care providers need to
make thoughtful decisions that serve the patient's goals and well-
being and that take seriously the limits of health care resources.
This might mean, for example, that persons near the end of life
choose to forego expensive treatments, the effectiveness of which
might be very limited. We encourage people to talk together with
their families and health care providers about treatment goals and
types of care, and to make decisions that reflect their responsibility
to be good stewards of their health and the resources that are
available. We live with the tensions created by the limits of resources
for health care, hoping for healing in this life and trusting in God's
promise of wholeness in eternal life.
Adults and families do well to prepare for future health care
choices they may need to make, especially regarding end-of-life care
or in situations when they are no longer able to speak for themselves.
Conversations with loved ones and health care professionals about
wishes and values, along with the use of advance directives, help
others respect a person's desires and minimize the tremendous stress
and suffering that later treatment decisions may entail.
Our personal responsibilities for health also extend to helping
others meet their needs while supporting them as they take
responsibility for their health care. We all have opportunities with
our family, friends, and neighbors to provide meals, transportation,
or comfort for those who are ill and to support professional and
volunteer caregivers. We also have opportunities to pray for one
another. We should take care not to blame people for their health
problems, and work to minimize both the stress of coping and the
potentially isolating stigma of some conditions. Most of all, we stand
ready to be present with and care for those who suffer, whatever
the reason.
As citizens, we ought to support those disease-preventing and
health-promoting public health measures that can be taken only at
community, state, and national levels. We also have responsibility
to support similar efforts that address disease prevention, health
promotion, and treatment on a global scale.

The Church's Ministry
A ministry of healing is integral to the life and mission of the
Church. It expresses our faith in the power of God to create and to
save, as well as our commitment
to care for our neighbor. The
Holy Spirit empowers us so that
we can care for all people as
God's children and seek their
healing. The Church promotes
health and healing and provides
health care services through its social ministry organizations and
congregation-based programs. The Church's ministry may offer
healing or forms of health care in ways not found or adequately
addressed within a health care system. The Church also supports
the just obligations of a society to serve those who are often left out
and to be present with those who suffer. Because it originates from
and carries out Christ's healing work, the Church's ministry is freed
to contribute to the health care system as well as to address its
injustices.
Congregations
Worship stands at the center of the congregation's ministry of
healing. Holy Communion strengthens, sustains, and refreshes us
and heals the troubled conscience of believers through the gift of
grace. The preaching and hearing of the Word enliven us by the
promise of reconciliation with God through Christ. The liturgy
provides a structure of meaning that nourishes and sustains.  Music
and hymns often bring comfort and healing to those who are
suffering.  Education and pastoral care equip people to understand
better and cope with illness within the biblical story of God's
salvation. Congregations provide people with acceptance, support,
and community, listening to those who are ill and bringing their
suffering, injustices, and concerns to God in prayer. Congregations
hold up these dimensions of healing in all aspects of their life
together and in special liturgies of healing.5 They make special
provision for those who are ill to hear the Good News and receive
Holy Communion. Members visit the sick and dying; they encourage
and pray for those who are in health care occupations or are
voluntary caregivers. Some congregations develop specific health
ministries that include counseling centers, health care advocacy,
and congregational health ministry teams.  Parish nurse ministries
A ministry of healing is
integral to the life and
mission of the Church.
10
provide for wellness programs, including health screening and
health education.  As part of their ministries of health and healing,
congregations can also:
provide members with education and opportunities for
deliberation and advocacy about health issues;
ensure full participation of all people in the life of the
congregation by removing physical and other barriers;
help people evaluate avenues of care and treatment, whether
those of standard Western medicine, various complementary
systems, or those based in religious claims or faith communities,
and to distinguish between means that are appropriate and
beneficial and those that are potentially inappropriate or
exploitive;
seek ways to collaborate with and support our church's social
ministry organizations;
provide physical access and other vital links between people and
the health care they need, especially in rural communities and
inner cities;
strengthen efforts to be places where people seek help in times of
crisis or need, where spiritual needs are understood and met,
and where traditions are honored and shared;
pay particular attention to the health of all staff, providing a
working environment that is physically and emotionally safe and
supportive, as well as a work schedule that allows for adequate
recreation and stress reduction;6
ensure that all paid staff of the congregation have access to health
care services;
inform themselves of global health concerns and support global
ministries of health.
Social Ministry Organizations
For generations, Lutheran individuals and congregations have
identified unmet needs in their communities and worked to meet
them. As congregational programs of service have grown, they often
have become more formalized to engage resources and partners
beyond the congregation. These social ministry organizations
continue to arise from congregations and are an integral part of
our church's work in the world. By coordinating efforts and sharing

11
strengths, congregations, social ministry organizations, synods, and
other partners reach out more effectively to meet the health needs
of the neighbor.
Lutheran social ministry organizations provide a wide range of
services. These services help to treat acute and chronic illnesses of
body and mind, provide care for the whole person in need, and
strengthen and empower individuals and families to care for
themselves, for one another, and for their communities. Within these
and other health-related ministries, staff members and volunteers
exercise vocations of healing in administrative, direct care, pastoral
care, and governance roles. Supporting and developing these
institutions and vocations are the work of our whole church.
As institutions of this church serving in Christ's name, social
ministry organizations are accountable to live out that identity in
their daily work and decision-making. Lutheran social ministry
organizations witness to a church in action in many ways: by
protecting the health and well-being of those who serve; by careful
stewardship of resources; by respectful and equitable attention to
the physical, mental, and spiritual needs of those persons served;
and by establishing ways to ask and answer questions of ethics,
identity, and relationship. We also encourage social ministry
organizations to pay attention to the global context of their work
and to seek out opportunities for partnerships with their
counterparts in other countries for mutual learning and benefit.7
Social ministry organizations face challenging operational
environments, complex in their mix of financial, staffing,
competitive, and regulatory pressures. As these organizations
collaborate with others to provide health care, they seek to preserve
and enhance access to basic health care and extend services to those
in need. In cooperating with government, they are to "work with
civil authorities in areas of mutual endeavor, maintaining
institutional separation of church and state in a relation of functional
interaction."8
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America calls upon
government at all levels to provide sufficient and timely
reimbursement to social ministry organizations for the services they
offer on its behalf, allowing them to fulfill their missions with
integrity and faithfulness. We also call upon leaders of these
organizations to promote public policies that tailor services in greater
measure to those whose needs for healing and access to health care
12
are most often neglected, especially those with limited financial
resources. Advocacy to change unjust social structures or systemic
problems that exacerbate or perpetuate human misery is a shared
responsibility of social ministry organizations and people in this
church, together with others of common purpose. As people of faith,
we must heed the call to attend to the needs of our neighbor and
also to envision boldly what we might accomplish together, with
God's help.
Advocacy
Advocacy is a ministry of the Church and its members in the public
realm. Advocates use their voice and action to influence private
and public decision-making on behalf of the neighbor. Such advocacy
gives present voice to the prophetic cry, "Why then has the health
of my poor people not been restored?" (Jeremiah 8:22). This voice
addresses both public policy and the policies of corporations.
Advocacy for public policy is carried out for the churchwide and
synodical expressions of this church by people called both to speak
to lawmakers on its behalf and to provide information and
encouragement to church members to contact their own
representatives. Continuing advocacy by the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America is one expression of the shared endeavor of
health care in the human community and is based on existing social
policy statements.9 Advocacy for public policy is also a responsibility
of individuals acting in their calling as Christians and citizens.
This social statement continues and strengthens our church's
advocacy for health care. Improving access to health care and
finding adequate support for public health and preventive, acute,
and long-term care services for all are critical advocacy challenges.
They require thoughtful deliberation and bold, continuing advocacy
by Christian citizens and all expressions of this church.
Toward a Better System of Health Care Services
A health care system should have the explicit purpose of:
promoting and improving the health of all people; reducing the
impact and burden of illness, injury, and disability; and promoting
healing, even when cure is not possible. Too often, however, the
various sectors of health care and health promotion are fragmented
and disjointed. This inhibits equitable access to health-related
services and good quality care, especially when individuals are
unable to obtain the treatment they need. This system should be
13
coherent, with the different services being functionally interrelated
and mutually accountable. No one group – public or private – can
design the structure or financing of such a system alone;
representatives of all groups that
provide services and financing
must together seek a solution
that enhances interdependence.
Health care as a shared
endeavor 
entails 
a
comprehensive and coherent set
of services of good quality care
throughout one's life span. At a
minimum, each person should have ready access to basic health
care services that include preventive, acute, and chronic physical
and mental health care at an affordable cost.10 The United States
does not currently have a health care system that is capable of care
for all people. Significant changes in financing and structure are
therefore required. Discerning what these changes might entail
within the limits of what is economically and politically feasible
needs to be worked out as a shared endeavor in the democratic
process.
Without attempting to describe all components and attributes of
a system in detail, the following highlights some particular concerns
that require our attention.
Public Health Services
Health as a shared endeavor makes public health services, which
focus on the population as a whole, the foundation for any health
care system. We urge renewed
political and financial support
for services undertaken on
behalf of the entire community
to prevent epidemics, limit
threats to health, promote
healthy 
behavior, 
reduce
injuries, assist in recovery from
disasters, and ensure that people
have access to needed services. Governments have an obligation to
provide or organize many of these services, but all services depend
on active collaboration with the entire community.
Health care as a shared
endeavor entails a
comprehensive and coherent
set of services of good quality
care throughout one's life
span.
Health as a shared endeavor
makes public health services,
which focus on the popula-
tion as a whole, the founda-
tion for any health care
system.
14
Since threats to health do not respect national boundaries, nations
and international organizations must cooperate in public health
efforts. In facing this global challenge, the United States government
and non-governmental organizations have responsibility to work
with others in such areas as securing clean water and sanitation,
overcoming hunger and malnutrition, preventing and combating
infectious diseases, responding to disasters, and providing health
services for women, men, and children who live in poverty.
Whole Patient Care
Any person seeking health care ought to be treated and respected
as a whole person, not merely as a site of disease or injury. Health
care should attend to the
physical, mental, and spiritual
dimensions of the person
seeking care. In cooperation
with 
religious 
and 
other
community 
organizations,
pastoral and spiritual care
should be available at all levels
of health care services. We endorse efforts to incorporate mental
health services more substantially within the health care system
and to grant mental health needs parity with other health care
needs. The debilitating suffering caused by mental illness for both
sufferers and loved ones is intensified by the labeling, isolation, and
moral blame that often accompany this illness.
Whole patient care also requires attention to the following
concerns:
Professional-patient relationships. Healing depends on the
relationship between the physician or other health care professional
and the patient. This relationship should be a partnership of trust
in pursuit of a shared goal appropriate to each individual's
circumstances. Central to this relationship is recognition of the
patient's vulnerability and respect for patient confidentiality and
the privacy of medical information. Good care also requires health
care professionals and patients to deliberate together on the facts
and values in each option for care. Doctors and hospitals should
give full information on measures that might be taken. All care using
either standard or complementary approaches should serve the
patient's best interest, recognizing the patient's increased
vulnerability during times of illness and respecting ethnic and
Any person seeking health
care ought to be treated and
respected as a whole person,
not merely as a site of disease
or injury.
15
religious differences. Informed consent is a moral and legal
requirement prior to whatever services are chosen. Professionals
should never abuse their power but always foster relationships of
trust based on a broad understanding of health and healing.
Diminishing the quality of this relationship – including time available
for the patient – primarily for financial or other reasons undermines
good health care in all its dimensions.
Curing and caring. Cure is central to healing and often a major
goal for health care. Our church celebrates efforts to achieve cures.
Patients and caregivers should
not, however, see lack of cure as
a 
failure 
or 
cause 
for
abandoning other forms of
healing and care. We support
both patients and care providers in making the difficult decision
that they no longer will seek cure in particular instances. We can
always care, even when we cannot cure.
Healing and chronic conditions. Many people live in need of long-
term care because of chronic illness or disability. Successes in saving
or prolonging life have led to an increase in these numbers. A health
care system must attend to their needs. Healing for persons living
with chronic conditions requires attention to loss of bodily integrity
and wholeness, questions of meaning, disruption of relationships,
new challenges of daily living and pursuit of vocation, altered living
arrangements, and other features of chronic conditions. An essential
part of this healing is the ongoing caring presence of health care
professionals and chaplains, as well as informal caregivers and
others in the community.
Other approaches to healing. Increasingly, people are also seeking
approaches to healing that generally have been outside standard
Western medical treatment models. This often reflects not only a
desire for new cures, but also a longing for aspects of healing and
care that have been neglected. This church encourages openness to
such new ways of thinking but commends critical evaluation of all
avenues of healing, caution in their application, and humility in
their practice.
Palliative care. Palliative care reduces the burden of symptoms,
provides comfort, and relieves pain and suffering. It is a vital
component of health care. People often seek health care to relieve
pain and suffering. Pain is often under-treated for various reasons,
We can always care, even
when we cannot cure.
16
including failure to ask about and report pain, misconceptions
regarding pain treatment, or inadequate pain-management
practices. Caregivers should make every reasonable effort to alleviate
pain, regardless of whether cure is possible.
Pain may cause suffering, but suffering also may occur in the
absence of pain. Whole person care – including pastoral and other
non-medical forms of care – recognizes suffering, seeks to relieve it
when possible, and helps people understand it in the context of
God's salvation. Suffering often causes people to ask why they have
an affliction or why they may not be cured. Just as Jesus' path led
through the crucifixion to the resurrection, faith does not guarantee
the absence of suffering but promises God's presence in suffering.
Peaceful Dying. Through Christ, death has been defeated and
lost its "sting" (1 Corinthians 15:55). In placing our trust in the
Gospel's promise, we are freed from the power of death and the
need to cling to life at all costs. Too often people die alone, in pain,
away from home, without good care, and without having addressed
important issues of relationships or domestic affairs. Our health
care system should not abandon those who are dying.  When death
is imminent, peaceful dying should become a goal of health care,
sought as confidently and competently as other goals of health care
through adequate palliative care and services such as hospice.11
Caregiver Support
Supporting physicians, nurses, paid health care workers,
volunteers, and family members is a central, not a secondary,
obligation of a health care system. As growing numbers of people
live with chronic conditions and as the average age of the population
increases, there is an increased demand for caregivers in institutions
and at home. Caregivers are at the heart of providing health care
services and promoting healing. Both our society and church must
pay ongoing attention to fostering health care vocations and
encouraging the recruitment of sufficient numbers of caregivers to
meet the demand. Fairness requires that health care institutions
provide adequate pay, benefits, and good working conditions to
support and maintain a sufficient number of skilled caregivers.
Research and Technology Development
This church recognizes that the fruits of medical research and
innovation are often means through which God blesses and heals
creation.  It commends the important work of medical research and
17
supports investment in its goals of healing afflictions, relieving
human suffering, and promoting well-being. We also affirm the
important service to God and neighbor rendered by those who
develop and use curative technologies and practices.
We caution, however, against unrealistic faith in technological
progress as the primary solution for overcoming social problems
and all forms of sickness, suffering, and physical death. The many
communal components of health such as community environments
and interpersonal relationships prompt us to address those
dimensions to prevent disease and improve health, rather than
disproportionately favoring technological solutions. We also
commend continuing research into the broader dimensions of
healing, such as health promotion, complementary therapies,
bioethics, and quality living with chronic conditions. But we urge
caution about research that expands medical technology based
primarily on market pressures.
Health care research first should
address 
those 
medical
interventions that are likely to
improve 
substantially 
the
overall health of the general
population. 
While 
this
statement cannot explore the
many questions raised about
particular research endeavors, this church supports research that
is consistent with the perspectives of this social statement and widely
accepted standards of biomedical research.
Professional Education
Health care professionals should have access to affordable,
comprehensive education. This education should involve learning
technical excellence as well as the skills and traits that enable them
to work with others to promote health and healing for all people,
including the chronically ill and the dying. The cost of educating
health professionals should allow qualified people from all
backgrounds to pursue their vocation. Attention must be given to
providing adequate, ongoing, and affordable training for support
staff and volunteers.

Equitable Access to Health Care for All
A Matter of Love and Justice
The system of health care described above is far from a reality
today. It will be achieved only through thoughtful engagement by
all components of society. One major challenge is achieving equitable
access to basic health care for all people. We of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America commit ourselves to work with others
to attain this goal.
At the center of Lutheran ethics is the love (agape) shown us by
God through Jesus Christ, who laid down his life for us that we
may have life and have it more abundantly (John 10:10). We hear
what Scripture asks of us: "How does God's love abide in anyone
who has the world's goods and sees a brother or sister in need and
yet refuses help?" (1 John 3:17). In response to God's love, therefore,
we work to promote the health and healing of all people.
We also are a people compelled by justice. Jesus called justice one
of the "weightier matters of the law," too often neglected by religious
people (Matthew 23:23). Our search for justice is a call from God, a
concern especially for the "rights of the needy" (Jeremiah 5:28).
Because health is central to personal well-being and functioning in
society, a just society is one that supports the health of all its
members.12 Thus, our common effort to provide access to health
care for all is a matter of social justice for all people.
Justice requires giving to each person his or her due. Health care
is the kind of good most appropriately given on the basis of need.13
Too often, however, health care is distributed on the basis of merit,
social worth or contribution, marketplace value, or ability to pay.
Many forms of access benefit some people at the expense of others.
This happens because eligibility for services or funding may be
defined so that some people are included while others are not.
Governments or companies decide to pay for some services people
may need rather than others. Caregiving organizations or individuals
may decide to help some people but not others. These ways of
distributing health care may result in a failure of justice. It is time
to confront directly and urgently the issues of limits and resource
distribution to develop solutions that are more just.
Justice also requires a fair distribution of the benefits and burdens
of health care. This does not entail treating every person identically,
19
but treating similar cases similarly. Currently, despite programs to
provide at least some care for the poorest among us, the percentage
of people with health insurance is lower as income declines. A
growing group of individuals and families from many income levels
are involuntarily without health insurance. Ethnic status also affects
whether one has health insurance: Latinos, Asians and Pacific
Islanders, American Indians, and Blacks are significantly less likely
to be insured than non-Hispanic Whites.14 Regardless of whether
they have insurance, many members of disadvantaged ethnic groups
tend to have poorer health than Whites, just as those living in
poverty tend to have poorer health than those living on higher
incomes. We call upon our society to give priority to people and
groups who are not benefitting from access to health care services
and research: people who are uninsured and underinsured, people
living in poverty, those in rural areas, immigrants, residents of
U. S. Territories and Puerto Rico, marginalized groups, and those
suffering the consequences of our failure to implement adequate
public health protection.
Moving toward Just Access
While the mandate for equitable access to health care for all is
clear and compelling, questions about the best organizational and
financing mechanisms for achieving it leave room for legitimate
disagreement in this church and in society. Because health care is
one vital social good among many, people also legitimately differ
over how to balance expenditures for health care with other social
goods.
Our obligation could be met through any one of several
combinations of personal, market, and governmental means,
although none of these means alone can provide equitable access to
health care. Taking personal responsibility for one's health and the
health of others can meet some health care needs and provide care
in important ways; however, many people are left without adequate
care due to uneven distribution of health care and wealth. Markets
of health care services may contribute to improved quality and
efficiency, but they also may contribute to increased costs, unequal
access, and both over- and under-treatment. Governments are
shaped by political pressures and often function with inefficiencies;
yet as representatives of all citizens they have a particular
responsibility to ensure society's obligations to promote the general
welfare. This includes such areas as security, education, and health
20
care. Public health measures ensuring safe water and food, or
preventing and limiting outbreaks of infectious diseases are so
"communal" that they can be done well only from a governmental
base with adequate tax dollars.
As the guarantors of justice and promoters of the general welfare,
governments also have the unique role of ensuring equitable access
to health care for all. This role does not necessarily entail a specific
governmental program or one approach to health care coverage. It
does mean, however, that governments have the obligation to
provide leadership and coordination in balancing competing private
and social interests in moving toward the goal of equitable access
to health care. In ways that are fair in both process and outcome,
citizen representatives in government must take on the challenging
task of defining the level of health care services to which each person
should have access.
Meeting Our Obligations
Achieving these obligations of love and justice requires sacrifice,
goodwill, fairness, and an abiding commitment to place personal
and social responsibilities of love
and justice above narrower
individual, institutional, and
political self-interests. For some
people, this may mean paying
more in taxes or in direct
payments 
to 
assure 
that
everyone has care. As difficult
as this may be, citizens should
not shrink from these moral challenges. We urge all people to
advocate for access to basic health care for all and to participate
vigorously and responsibly in the public discussion on how best to
fulfill this obligation. The chronic failure of our society to provide
its members access to basic health care services is a moral tragedy
that should not be tolerated.
Alongside the pursuit of justice, we in the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America recognize the biblical obligation that each person
in society is responsible for the neighbor. No one of us is free to pass
by "on the other side" (Luke 10:31-32) and assume that governments
and other parties will take care of all obligations for health care.
We therefore seek to participate in and supplement health care
services out of love for all people who are in need (Matthew 25:36).
We urge all people to advo-
cate for access to basic health
care for all and to participate
vigorously and responsibly in
the public discussion on how
best to fulfill this obligation.
21
All people of good will should be concerned especially to attend to
the health care needs of those who, for whatever reason, lack
adequate care or are marginalized in society. People without power
and status such as the poor and needy, widows and orphans, and
the incurably ill were the focus of attention of the biblical prophets
(Isaiah 10:2) and of the healing ministry of Jesus (Matthew 4:23).
Ethical Guidance for Individuals and Families
Health care as a shared endeavor entails responsible ethical
decision making by individuals and families. As people provide and
receive health care, they likely will at some time face difficult
decisions regarding their own or another's well-being. Decisions
about life-prolonging treatments are among the most common and
difficult, but they are not the only situations for which an ethical
framework is needed.
Health and Finitude. Finding ethical guidance begins with being
mindful of how we as people of faith understand health and
health care and what it means to be healthy. We must accept the
limits imposed by human finitude and have realistic expectations
of health care because our resources also are finite. Health
eventually fails; suffering and death come to us all. The promise
of the resurrection means that suffering and death are not the
final word for our lives.
Love. People ought always to act out of love, as exemplified by
the life of Jesus Christ. Love means giving of ourselves for the
sake of others' well-being, doing no harm, promoting the well-
being of the neighbor, and treating people with respect and
dignity as children of God and as whole persons.
Stewardship. The obligation to be good stewards of what God
has given us should inform our use of health care resources. This
means using health and health care wisely, judiciously, and in
service toward God and God's purposes. Congregations are one
place to which individuals and families can look for support and
guidance in considering these decisions.
Justice. In addition, people should consider their individual health
care decisions within the context of the just distribution of health
care resources. Health care and its technological instruments
increasingly are powerful and expensive. People should ask not
only whether they are being served as individuals, but also
1.
2.
3.
4.
22
whether anyone is being left behind in the ongoing advance of
medical progress.
Self-determination. A dominant principle in health care ethics
is the right of individuals to be freely self-determining with regard
to their own bodies and medical treatment decisions (autonomy).
This principle rightly protects against unjustifiable medical and
familial paternalism. This church supports an individual's
freedom to make health care decisions according to her or his
own conscience and moral discernment.15 Yet, ultimately people
belong to God, and the exercise of self-determination should
always be understood within that relationship.16
As Christians we discern our moral responsibilities through
consulting Scripture, the experience of the community of faith, and
the exercise of reason.17 We deliberate about our decisions not merely
as patients or caregivers, but as seekers of God's will. We recognize
that the broader dimensions of health and healing compel us to
consider our neighbor and our love for them as we make decisions.
Above all, we ask God for guidance, mercy, and forgiveness in all
our decision-making.
Conclusion
Christians know that health and healing are from God, "who
forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases" (Psalm 103:3).
We wait patiently and hopefully for healing, which may come
through cure or in reconciliation with God, our neighbor, and our
own selves, even without cure. Sometimes reconciliation with God
or the neighbor may be a prelude to physical healing: "Therefore
confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that
you may be healed" (James 5:16). Such healing may not result in
complete health, but it reflects
God's goodness and mercy and
anticipates the full healing of life
and the peace that is to come.
Accepting health care as a
shared 
endeavor 
requires
commitment of all people to the
well-being of their neighbor and
themselves. It also requires the commitment of all to work for change
in a political, economic, and cultural environment that often is more
adversarial than cooperative. The Church is a community that,

and fear of death.
23
through Word and Sacrament and the actions of its faithful, can
bear witness to the commitments of love and justice that change
will require.
The Gospel offers the world the hope of abundant and everlasting
life, that liberates us from idolatry of health and fear of death. Out
of this freedom, Christians can accept the limits of this life and seek
to realize a vision of health care for all people as a shared endeavor.
