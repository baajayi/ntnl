For the next several weeks my posts will be discussing and sharing about the trip to Germany that
my spouse, the Rev. Kendra Mohn, PhD and I hosted May 26-June 6, 2024. This trip included
members of her congregation, NT-NL lay leaders, and 7 rostered leaders from NT-NL with a total
of 35 in our traveling party. Traveling abroad and seeing these historic sites is a gift and we are
grateful to share and learn about our heritage of faith…
Landing in Frankfort we drove immediately to Mainz for a tour of this historic city. Here we saw
the Cathedral and were reminded it was Albrecht von Brandenberg, Archbishop of Mainz, to
whom Martin Luther addressed the 95 theses. Those theses intended for a debate about the use
and sale of indulgences of which Albrecht was prolific. Mainz was at that time a powerful
bishopric within the Holy Roman Empire .
Mainz was also the home of Johannes Gutenberg, who printing press revolutionized as well the
way that documents such as the 95 theses, and the indulgences they protested, were spread.
The Gutenberg Museum in Mainz provided a wonderful lesson on how the printing press worked
as well as a collection of beautiful original texts. It was also a reminder that while we tend to
lump Luther and Gutenberg into the same time period in fact Gutenberg lived almost 100 years
before Luther.
We then traveled to Worms where Luther had his famous “Here I Stand” moment before Charles
V, Holy Roman Emperor. While the building where the Imperial Diet took place no longer stands
a remembrance of Luther has been placed where he might have stood. Allowing us, even a bishop
from Texas-Louisiana, to put our feet into Luther’s shoes for a moment. It was powerful to walk
the streets of Worms, visit the churches, and think about the power and privilege that Luther and
his supporters were opposing. Rome may have been far off, but the power of the archbishop here
was very real, particularly with the Holy Roman Emperor in town.

We also took time to enjoy the hospitality and abundance of this section of Germany. Our dinner
was at a local family owned winery which produces fine white wine. We enjoyed an outdoor meal
before heading back to our hotel.
Travel, particular international travel, is a distinct privilege and should never be taken for granted.
It also gives us new perspectives. Being in Mainz and seeing how powerful Albrecht was. The
wealth of the community, the ability to spread news through the printed word, was educational
again to realize what Luther and those who supported him were up against. They were not the
majority nor did they have the political or ecclesial power, yet they trusted in the Word of God.
That temporal estates, be they of their time or ours, are not the last word. God’s Word, the living
Word of Jesus, Alpha and Omega, is both the beginning and the ending Word.
We had a wonderful first couple days, if a bit rainy at times, as we witnessed this heritage. Our
conversations centering on how having seen these places does it influence ourselves as we live
into our faith and life today in our synod and beyond.
More to come…
