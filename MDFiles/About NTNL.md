Planted in one of the fastest growing and demographically diverse areas of the country, the Northern Texas-Northern Louisiana Synod is committed to developing
leadership to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ, growing our congregations, and welcoming all people to share in this life-giving message of hope, inclusion, and
justice.
Commitments
Mission
To raise up leaders who can model Christian discipleship, preach the Law and the Gospel, develop and grow communities of faith, work for justice, and welcome all to the
table of grace.
Leadership
Leaders are essential to the mission of the Gospel. NT-NL is committed to developing leaders of all ages to serve, proclaim good news, and work for justice. This includes
leaders in local congregations, as well as rostered leaders in the ELCA.
Rostered Ministry
Ministers of Word and Sacrament, as well as Word and Service, are official rosters of our church. These individuals have gone through education, formation, and have been
officially rostered as leaders in our communities. These leaders can be found on this website.
Heritage
We give thanks for the heritage of the Lutheran Confessional witness in North Texas. In our territory is the oldest continually operating Lutheran community in the State of
Texas at Four Mile in Mabank dating to 1847. However, the majority of our congregations are less than 50 years old, and we have a vibrant outreach into the diversity of
North Texas with congregations worshipping in five different languages, including Spanish, Swahili, Oromo, Finnish, and Indonesian.
