As the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), we assure our Muslim neighbors 
of our love and respect and reaffirm our commitment to working together in our shared 
communities for the common good. As people who know that we live by the grace and in the 
sight of the one, almighty, and merciful God, we have confidence that our engagement will 
result in mutual learning, growth, and enrichment. 
We make this declaration, realizing full well that interlocking forms of hatred – anti-Muslim 
bigotry, anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia – are all around us.1 Our Muslim neighbors 
experience subtle and not-so-subtle acts of aggression and violence, including vandalism 
against their community centers and masjids (mosques). In the United States, such bigotry 
is often amplified by political rhetoric and social media. We in the ELCA emphatically reject 
such attitudes and actions, and the malice and fear that fuel them. Anti-Muslim hatred is 
antithetical to our Christian faith and counter to Lutheran teachings, which focus on God’s 
good news for the world2 and instill in us a love for our neighbor, the kind of love that casts 
out fear (1 John 4:18). 
The ELCA is part of a global Lutheran movement, a living legacy of the theological tradition 
associated with Martin Luther (1483-1546). In 2017, the ELCA marked the 500th anniversary 
of the Reformation by lifting up our ecumenical and inter-religious partnerships. After more 
than 50 years of dialogue and cooperation, our reflections about our identity as Lutherans 
have become inseparable from those about our ecumenical and inter-religious relations. We 
have looked back at the divisions of the past in order to look forward to our common life 
together in the future. We also rejoice at the extraordinary progress that has been made in 
the reconciliation of relationships.  
In 2019 such reflections led the ELCA Churchwide Assembly to adopt “A Declaration of Inter-
Religious Commitment: A Policy Statement of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.”3 
1 Though this declaration is specifically addressed to the Muslim community, it should be read and interpreted alongside 
the church’s other declarations, especially “A Declaration of the ELCA to the Jewish Community,” “A Declaration of Inter-
Religious Commitment,” “A Declaration of the ELCA to People of African Descent,” and “A Declaration of the ELCA to 
American Indian and Alaska Native People.”

euangelion, “good news.”

A DECLARATION OF THE
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
to the Muslim Community
This declaration commits the ELCA to pray for our neighbors of other religions and 
worldviews; to seek understanding; to stand in solidarity with them; to practice hospitality; to 
seek counsel and mutuality in planning and decision-making; to “confess when our words or 
deeds (or lack thereof) cause offense, harm, or violence to our neighbors” and to “repent and 
seek forgiveness from God and reconciliation with our neighbors.”4  
During these past years we have had the opportunity to re-read, reflect upon, and interpret 
for our time the voluminous writings of Martin Luther. In them we find words that edify 
and give life. But we also encounter Luther’s crude polemics, which at times portray Islam 
in negative ways and reduce Muslims to tropes (the fearsome “Turk”) in the face of military 
threats. We are reminded that, for Luther, the safeguarding of precious teaching entailed the 
sharpest possible rejection of difference.
We in the ELCA have learned, with and from our partners, a different way – that of 
dialogue, in which difference is acknowledged and honored. We have experienced dialogue 
as an occasion for genuine learning, honest conversation, retrieval of neglected aspects of 
one’s own tradition, fresh insight, and the cultivation of respect and friendship.5 We have 
discovered that the precious teaching we have inherited is not at risk, but enriched, through 
dialogue. With our partners, we have for many years been exploring this way – of friendship, 
mutual understanding and accountability, joint service, and witness. We are committed to 
pursuing this path of dialogue together.
We also are determined to learn from our history. Luther’s characterizations of Muslims 
were borne not out of dialogue but at a dehumanizing distance – fueled by fear and end-
of-world expectations. Through loving our neighbors, we have come to reject Luther’s 
polemics. We do not dismiss our history but take it to heart. By embracing dialogue instead 
of rejecting difference, we have come to realize that we can truly love our neighbors only 
when we know them.  
Indeed, we recommit ourselves to the heart of our theological inheritance. Though we are a 
fractured and fractious people, our calling is to love God and our neighbor. As Luther himself 
put it in his best-known writing, the “Small Catechism,” the commandment “You shall not 
bear false witness against your neighbor” means not only that “we do not tell lies about our 
neighbors, betray or slander them, or destroy their reputations” but also that we should “come 
to their defense, speak well of them, and interpret everything they do in the best possible 
light.”6 On the basis of this teaching, we in the ELCA seek friendship and solidarity with our 
Muslim neighbors, not in spite of our Lutheran Christian commitments but because of them. 
Diverse communities of Muslims and Lutherans have long been part of North America. These 
communities have engaged in a dialogue of life in towns and cities across the continent. The

years since 9/11 have been especially important for deepening these relationships, in North 
America and throughout the world, including through the Lutheran World Federation.7 We 
acknowledge with gratitude a series of efforts by Muslims to build peaceful communities 
and societies, including “A Common Word Between Us and You” (2007)8 and the “Marrakesh 
Declaration” (2016).9  
Given the disunity around us and the fear of the unknown, we sense the renewed urgency 
to nurture relationships and build communities in which we look upon one another with 
respect and esteem, in which people feel safe and loved, and in which we seek the common 
good together. As the ELCA, we recommit10 ourselves to learning from and with Muslims, 
providing educational resources on Christian-Muslim relations for use across the church;11 
to dialogue and friendship, seeking opportunities for relationship-building at every level of 
the ELCA; and to solidarity, standing shoulder to shoulder12 with our Muslim neighbors in the 
face of bigotry and injustice, pursuing peace for all people and creation.
“While Luther himself could have never anticipated this, we have come to expect great joy in 
our companionship for the journey” with our Muslim neighbors.13 May we be “called to one 
another as to a holy site, where God’s living revelation in the world is received in reverence 
among the faithful and not in fear of our neighbors.”14 And may almighty God grant us the 
will and strength to pursue this path, success in our shared work for the common good, and 
joy in our encounters.
