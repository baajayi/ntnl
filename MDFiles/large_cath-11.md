<br>XI. 
<br>Part Third. 
<br>Of Prayer. 
<br>__________</center></b> 
 
<blockquote><blockquote> 
<p><b><a name="lords">The Lord's Prayer.</a></b> 
 
<p>     We have now heard what we must do and believe, in which things 
        the best and happiest life consists. Now follows the third 
        part, how we ought to pray. For since we are so situated that 
        no man can perfectly keep the Ten Commandments, even though he 
        have begun to believe, and since the devil with all his power 
        together with the world and our own flesh, resists our 
        endeavors, nothing is so necessary as that we should 
        continually resort to the ear of God, call upon Him, and pray 
        to Him, that He would give, preserve, and increase in us faith 
        and the fulfilment of the Ten Commandments, and that He would 
        remove everything that is in our way and opposes us therein. 
        But that we might know what and how to pray, our Lord Christ 
        has Himself taught us both the mode and the words, as we shall 
        see.</p> 
 
<p>     But before we explain the Lord's Prayer part by part, it is 
        most necessary first to exhort and incite people to prayer, as 
        Christ and the apostles also have done. And the first matter 
        is to know that it is our duty to pray because of God's 
        commandment. For thus we heard in the Second Commandment: Thou 
        shalt not take the name of the lord, thy God, in vain, that we 
        are there required to praise that holy name, and call upon it 
        in every need, or to pray. For to call upon the name of God is 
        nothing else than to pray. Prayer is therefore as strictly and 
        earnestly commanded as all other commandments: to have no 
        other God, not to kill, not to steal, etc. Let no one think 
        that it is all the same whether he pray or not, as vulgar 
        people do, who grope in such delusion and ask Why should I 
        pray? Who knows whether God heeds or will hear my prayer? If I 
        do not pray, some one else will. And thus they fall into the 
        habit of never praying, and frame a pretext, as though we 
        taught that there is no duty or need of prayer, because we 
        reject false and hypocritical prayers.</p> 
 
<p>     But this is true indeed that such prayers as have been offered 
        hitherto when men were babbling and bawling in the churches 
        were no prayers. For such external matters, when they are 
        properly observed, may be a good exercise for young children, 
        scholars, and simple persons, and may be called singing or 
        reading, but not really praying. But praying, as the Second 
        Commandment teaches, is to call upon God in every need. This 
        He requires of us, and has not left it to our choice. But it 
        is our duty and obligation to pray if we would be Christians, 
        as much as it is our duty and obligation to obey our parents 
        and the government; for by calling upon it and praying the 
        name of God is honored and profitably employed. This you must 
        note above all things, that thereby you may silence and repel 
        such thoughts as would keep and deter us from prayer. For just 
        as it would be idle for a son to say to his father, "Of what 
        advantage is my obedience? I will go and do what I can; it is 
        all the same"; but there stands the commandment, Thou shalt 
        and must do it, so also here it is not left to my will to do 
        it or leave it undone, but prayer shall and must be offered at 
        the risk of God's wrath and displeasure.</p> 
 
<p>     This is therefore to be understood and noted before everything 
        else, in order that thereby we may silence and repel the 
        thoughts which would keep and deter us from praying, as though 
        it were not of much consequence if we do not pray, or as 
        though it were commanded those who are holier and in better 
        favor with God than we; as, indeed, the human heart is by 
        nature so despondent that it always flees from God and 
        imagines that He does not wish or desire our prayer, because 
        we are sinners and have merited nothing but wrath. Against 
        such thoughts (I say) we should regard this commandment and 
        turn to God, that we may not by such disobedience excite His 
        anger still more. For by this commandment He gives us plainly 
        to understand that He will not cast us from Him nor chase us 
        away, although we are sinners, but rather draw us to Himself, 
        so that we might humble ourselves before Him, bewail this 
        misery and plight of ours, and pray for grace and help. 
        Therefore we read in the Scriptures that He is angry also with 
        those who were smitten for their sin, because they did not 
        return to Him and by their prayers assuage His wrath and seek 
        His grace.</p> 
 
<p>     Now, from the fact that it is so solemnly commanded to pray, 
        you are to conclude and think, that no one should by any means 
        despise his prayer, but rather set great store by it, and 
        always seek an illustration from the other commandments. A 
        child should by no means despise his obedience to father and 
        mother, but should always think: This work is a work of 
        obedience, and what I do I do with no other intention than 
        that I may walk in the obedience and commandment of God, on 
        which I can settle and stand firm, and esteem it a great 
        thing, not on account of my worthiness, but on account of the 
        commandment. So here also, what and for what we pray we should 
        regard as demanded by God and done in obedience to Him, and 
        should reflect thus: On my account it would amount to nothing; 
        but it shall avail, for the reason that God has commanded it. 
        Therefore everybody, no matter what he has to say in prayer, 
        should always come before God in obedience to this 
        commandment.</p> 
 
<p>     We pray, therefore, and exhort every one most diligently to 
        take this to heart and by no means to despise our prayer. For 
        hitherto it has been taught thus in the devil's name that no 
        one regarded these things, and men supposed it to be 
        sufficient to have done the work, whether God would hear it or 
        not. But that is staking prayer on a risk, and murmuring it at 
        a venture, and therefore it is a lost prayer. For we allow 
        such thoughts as these to lead us astray and deter us: I am 
        not holy or worthy enough; if I were as godly and holy as St. 
        Peter or St. Paul, then I would pray. But put such thoughts 
        far away, for just the same commandment which applied to St. 
        Paul applies also to me; and the Second Commandment is given 
        as much on my account as on his account, so that he can boast 
        of no better or holier commandment.</p> 
 
<p>     Therefore you should say: My prayer is as precious, holy, and 
        pleasing to God as that of St. Paul or of the most holy 
        saints. This is the reason: For I will gladly grant that he is 
        holier in his person, but not on account of the commandment; 
        since God does not regard prayer on account of the person, but 
        on account of His word and obedience thereto. For on the 
        commandment on which all the saints rest their prayer I, too, 
        rest mine. Moreover I pray for the same thing for which they 
        all pray and ever have prayed; besides, I have just as great a 
        need of it as those great saints, yea, even a greater one than 
        they.</p> 
 
<p>     Let this be the first and most important point, that all our 
        prayers must be based and rest upon obedience to God, 
        irrespective of our person, whether we be sinners or saints, 
        worthy or unworthy. And we must know that God will not have it 
        treated as a jest, but be angry, and punish all who do not 
        pray, as surely as He punishes all other disobedience; next, 
        that He will not suffer our prayers to be in vain or lost. For 
        if He did not intend to answer your prayer, He would not bid 
        you pray and add such a severe commandment to it.</p> 
 
<p>     In the second place, we should be the more urged and incited 
        to pray because God has also added a promise, and declared 
        that it shall surely be done to us as we pray, as He says Ps. 
        50, 15: Call upon Me in the day of trouble: I will deliver 
        thee. And Christ in the Gospel of St. Matthew, 7, 7: Ask, and 
        it shall be given you. For every one that asketh receiveth. 
        Such promises ought certainly to encourage and kindle our 
        hearts to pray with pleasure and delight, since He testifies 
        with His [own] word that our prayer is heartily pleasing to 
        Him, moreover, that it shall assuredly be heard and granted, 
        in order that we may not despise it or think lightly of it, 
        and pray at a venture.</p> 
 
<p>     This you can hold up to Him and say: Here I come, dear Father, 
        and pray, not of my own purpose nor upon my own worthiness, 
        but at Thy commandment and promise, which cannot fail or 
        deceive me. Whoever, therefore, does not believe this promise 
        must know again that he excites God to anger as a person who 
        most highly dishonors Him and reproaches Him with falsehood.</p> 
 
<p>     Besides this, we should be incited and drawn to prayer because 
        in addition to this commandment and promise God anticipates 
        us, and Himself arranges the words and form of prayer for us, 
        and places them upon our lips as to how and what we should 
        pray, that we may see how heartily He pities us in our 
        distress, and may never doubt that such prayer is pleasing to 
        Him and shall certainly be answered; which [the Lord's Prayer] 
        is a great advantage indeed over all other prayers that we 
        might compose ourselves. For in them the conscience would ever 
        be in doubt and say: I have prayed, but who knows how it 
        pleases Him, or whether I have hit upon the right proportions 
        and form? Hence there is no nobler prayer to be found upon 
        earth than the Lord's Prayer which we daily pray because it 
        has this excellent testimony, that God loves to hear it, which 
        we ought not to surrender for all the riches of the world.</p> 
 
<p>     And it has been prescribed also for this reason that we should 
        see and consider the distress which ought to urge and compel 
        us to pray without ceasing. For whoever would pray must have 
        something to present, state, and name which he desires; if 
        not, it cannot be called a prayer.</p> 
 
<p>     Therefore we have rightly rejected the prayers of monks and 
        priests, who howl and growl day and night like fiends; but 
        none of them think of praying for a hair's breadth of 
        anything. And if we would assemble all the churches, together 
        with all ecclesiastics, they would be obliged to confess that 
        they have never from the heart prayed for even a drop of wine. 
        For none of them has ever purposed to pray from obedience to 
        God and faith in His promise, nor has any one regarded any 
        distress, but (when they had done their best) they thought no 
        further than this, to do a good work, whereby they might repay 
        God, as being unwilling to take anything from Him, but wishing 
        only to give Him something.</p> 
 
<p>     But where there is to be a true prayer there must be 
        earnestness. Men must feel their distress, and such distress 
        as presses them and compels them to call and cry out then 
        prayer will be made spontaneously, as it ought to be, and men 
        will require no teaching how to prepare for it and to attain 
        to the proper devotion. But the distress which ought to 
        concern us most, both as regards ourselves and every one, you 
        will find abundantly set forth in the Lord's Prayer. Therefore 
        it is to serve also to remind us of the same, that we 
        contemplate it and lay it to heart, lest we become remiss in 
        prayer. For we all have enough that we lack, but the great 
        want is that we do not feel nor see it. Therefore God also 
        requires that you lament and plead such necessities and wants, 
        not because He does not know them, but that you may kindle 
        your heart to stronger and greater desires, and make wide and 
        open your cloak to receive much.</p> 
 
<p>     Therefore, every one of us should accustom himself from his 
        youth daily to pray for all his wants, whenever he is sensible 
        of anything affecting his interests or that of other people 
        among whom he may live, as for preachers, the government, 
        neighbors, domestics, and always (as we have said) to hold up 
        to God His commandment and promise, knowing that He will not 
        have them disregarded. This I say because I would like to see 
        these things brought home again to the people that they might 
        learn to pray truly, and not go about coldly and 
        indifferently, whereby they become daily more unfit for 
        prayer; which is just what the devil desires, and for what he 
        works with all his powers. For he is well aware what damage 
        and harm it does him when prayer is in proper practise. For 
        this we must know, that all our shelter and protection rest in 
        prayer alone. For we are far too feeble to cope with the devil 
        and all his power and adherents that set themselves against 
        us, and they might easily crush us under their feet. Therefore 
        we must consider and take up those weapons with which 
        Christians must be armed in order to stand against the devil. 
        For what do you think has hitherto accomplished such great 
        things, has checked or quelled the counsels, purposes, murder, 
        and riot of our enemies, whereby the devil thought to crush 
        us, together with the Gospel, except that the prayer of a few 
        godly men intervened like a wall of iron on our side? They 
        should else have witnessed a far different tragedy, namely, 
        how the devil would have destroyed all Germany in its own 
        blood. But now they may confidently deride it and make a mock 
        of it, however, we shall nevertheless be a match both for 
        themselves and the devil by prayer alone, if we only persevere 
        diligently and not become slack. For whenever a godly 
        Christian prays: Dear Father let Thy will be done, God speaks 
        from on high and says: Yes, dear child, it shall be so, in 
        spite of the devil and all the world.</p> 
 
<p>     Let this be said as an exhortation, that men may learn, first 
        of all, to esteem prayer as something great and precious, and 
        to make a proper distinction between babbling and praying for 
        something. For we by no means reject prayer, but the bare, 
        useless howling and murmuring we reject, as Christ Himself 
        also rejects and prohibits long palavers. Now we shall most 
        briefly and clearly treat of the Lord's Prayer. Here there is 
        comprehended in seven successive articles, or petitions, every 
        need which never ceases to relate to us, and each so great 
        that it ought to constrain us to keep praying it all our 
        lives.</p>
