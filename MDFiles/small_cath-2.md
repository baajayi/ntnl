<b><center>II. 
<br>THE CREED 
<br>__________</b></center> 
 
<blockquote><blockquote> 
 
<b>The Creed: The Simple Way a Father Should Present it to His Household</b> 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="1">I.  The First Article: On Creation</a></p> 
 
       <ul><p>I believe in God the Almighty Father, Creator of Heaven 
        and Earth.</b></p> 
 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
 
       <p><b>A.</b> I believe that God created me, along with all creatures. He gave to 
          me: body and soul, eyes, ears and all the other parts of my body, 
          my mind and all my senses and preserves them as well. He gives me 
          clothing and shoes, food and drink, house and land, wife and 
          children, fields, animals and all I own. Every day He abundantly 
          provides everything I need to nourish this body and life. He 
          protects me against all danger, shields and defends me from all 
          evil.  He does all this because of His pure, fatherly and divine 
          goodness and His mercy, not because I've earned it or desrved it. 
          For all of this, I must thank Him, praise Him, serve Him and obey 
          Him.  Yes, this is true!</p></ul></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="2">II. The Second Article: On Redemption</a> 
 
       <ul><p>And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, Who was conceived by the 
       Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, 
       was crucified, died and was buried, descended to Hell, on the third 
       day rose again from the dead, ascended to Heaven and sat down at the 
       right hand of God the Almighty Father. From there He will come to 
       judge the living and the dead.</b></p> 
 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
       <p><b>A.</b> I believe that Jesus Christ is truly God, born of the Father in 
          eternity and also truly man, born of the Virgin Mary. He is my 
          Lord! He redeemed me, a lost and condemned person, bought and won 
          me from all sins, death and the authority of the Devil. It did not 
          cost Him gold or silver, but His holy, precious blood, His innocent 
          body -- His death! Because of this, I am His very own, will live 
          under Him in His kingdom and serve Him righteously, innocently and 
          blessedly forever, just as He is risen from death, lives and reigns 
          forever. Yes, this is true.</p></ul></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="3">III. The Third Article: On Becoming Holy</a> 
 
       <ul><p>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Christian Church, the community 
       of the saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, 
       and an everlasting life. Amen.</b></p> 
 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
       <p><b>A.</b> I believe that I cannot come to my Lord Jesus Christ by my own 
       intellegence or power. But the Holy Spirit call me by the Gospel, 
       enlightened me with His gifts, made me holy and kept me in the true 
       faith, just as He calls, gathers together, enlightens and makes holy 
       the whole Church on earth and keeps it with Jesus in the one, true 
       faith. In this Church, He generously forgives each day every sin 
       committed by me and by every believer.  On the last day, He will raise 
       me and all the dead from the grave. He will give eternal life to me 
       and to all who believe in Christ. Yes, this is true!</p></ul></ul>
