<b><center>TRANSLATOR'S INTRODUCTION</center></b><p>
  
<p> In 1519, Luther preached a sermon "On Twofold Righteousness", based on 
 Philippians 2:5-11. This teaching, of a twofold righteousness, was 
 incorporated into the <b>Formula of Concord</b> (Solid Declaration, Article 
 III, "Righteousness", paragraph 32; Tappert, pp. 544-545; <b>Triglotta</b>, 
 p. 927). In this sermon, Luther identifies first a righteousness that is 
 alien, and infused from outside us, namely the righteousness of Christ. 
 Second is our own righteousness, the work and fruit of this first 
 righteousness.  
 
<p> The abrupt way in which this sermon states its thesis suggests that it 
 was deliberately intended by Luther to be a correction of, and replacement 
 for, his Sermon on Threefold Righteousness. I suggest that this 
 conclusion is inescapable, if one compares literal translations of both 
 sermons. For this reason, the translation below has deliberately been kept 
 as close to the original Latin as possible. The WA editors suggest the 
 Sermon on Threefold Righteousness was preached in September of 1518. I 
 would insist that the structure of this sermon, despite a few Lutheran 
 nuances, expresses a pre-Reformation theology of conversion (a civic 
 righteousness, followed by an intrinsic righteousness, followed by an 
 imputed righteousness). The German translation of this sermon, in the 
 St. Louis edition, makes Luther more Lutheran than he was at the time.  
 
<p> Preached at Wittenberg in 1518 
 
 
 
<p><b><center>OF THE REVEREND FATHER MARTIN LUTHER, WITTENBERG AUGUSTINIAN.</center></b> 
  
<p> Threefold is sin, to which is opposed a threefold righteousness or piety. 
 
 
<p><b>THE FIRST</b><br>  
 is criminal <b>todsuende</b>, that is manifest evil, which even the secular  
 power punishes, such as theft, homicide, arson, sacrilege, etc. Of these it 
 punishes some with the sword, with fire, with water, with a gallows, 
 with the wheel, such as in civil law, others with canonical penance, such 
 as ordinary fornications, and still others , such as in canon law.  
  
 To this (sin) that apparent righteousness <b>Scheingerechtigkeit</b> is 
 contrary which makes [people into] the apes, peacocks and fig trees of 
 Solomon (1 Kgs 10:22), by which comes about, that a man is good before 
 people, and cannot be accused, and avoids the punishments of the law, and 
 receives the temporal promises of the law [Rom 10:5]. Moses wrote, with 
 reference to that righteousness which is of the law, that if a person does 
 it, he will live in it (Lev 18:5, compare Gal 3:12), and Isaiah 1:19, If you 
 are willing and obedient you shall eat the good of the land. Such was 
 Naaman the Syrian, a great man before his lord, through whom the LORD 
 gave salvation to Syria [ 2 Kgs 5:1]. Such were many kings of Israel and the 
 people of Israel to whom the LORD gave good temporal things and many 
 victories, notwithstanding they were idolaters at the same time; such the 
 Samaritans, from whom God took away the lions [2 Kgs 17:25-40], 
 although they were worshipping idols and the LORD at the same time. Such 
 were the Romans according to Blessed Augustine [In his book on The City 
 of God, 51.1.14] to whom the LORD gave the greatest empire. Thus he is 
 accustomed to enrich also princes. Such to this very day are all who are 
 doing penance on account of plague, hunger, war, or other scourges of God, 
 who then pray, make pilgrimages, and make vows to the saints. Here 
 belong those who worship the saints for the sake of bodily things, and 
 priests who serve for the sake of present [temporal] things, and likewise 
 the monks, and those who do many other such things. In short, this is the 
 righteousness which receives its reward here, and is punished in the 
 future, but somewhat more mildly than criminals [but hereafter receives 
 eternal punishment, though milder than that of coarse criminals].  
  
<p> In the second place, it serves not God, but itself, nor is it the 
 righteousness of sons but of slaves, nor is it peculiar to Christians, but 
 rather is that of Jews and Gentiles. Nor are Christians to be exhorted to 
 it, because it proceeds out of fear of punishment or love of its own 
 comfort, not from the love of God.  
  
<p> Thirdly, it makes hypocrites, proud in the mind of their own heart, bold 
 judges of others, as is plain in [the parable of] that Pharisee and Simon 
 the Leper. [Lk 18:11; 7:39].  
  
<p> Fourthly the Apostle pronounced this curse (Gal 3:10): those who are of the 
 works of the law [he says] are under a curse.  
  
<p> Therefore Christians, who are to be enriched with eternal good things, are 
 not to be exhorted to that [righteousness], but rather discouraged (from it) 
 in favour of a better one. Hence one is not to rejoice in these things; just 
 as God enriches the Princes of Saxony with glory, riches, and pleasure, 
 because they are religious [pious lords], And if these things were not 
 enough, He will bring forth still a mountain of silver and peace [in the 
 land] will be preserved. But let them see themselves, whether this will do 
 them any good [for their salvation], lest they be mercenaries. For these 
 rewards are the rewards of that lowliest and accursed righteousness, 
 which pertains to the blessing of Esau and his sons (Gen 27:39f). These are 
 those who boast of the free will of the <b>Themenites</b> [trust in their own 
 conceit, like the <b>Themenites</b> - Baruch 3:23]. Thus God rewards even evil 
 things, because just as they are good in the eyes of men, so also they 
 receive good things in the eyes of men. . . 
  
  
<p><b>THE SECOND</b><br>  
 is essential sin, natal, original, alien, concerning which  
 Ps 51:7: Behold, for in iniquity I was conceived, and in sin my mother 
 conceived me, concerning which Christ: the tree cannot make good fruits 
 [Matt 7:18] and Rom 5:19a: through the disobedience of one man many were 
 constituted sinners, and through the transgression of one human all 
 humans into condemnation. And this is the sin which makes the prior 
 righteousness to be nothing and evil and cursed, as Christ says [Matt 
 12:33]: Either make the tree good and the fruits good, or the tree evil and 
 the fruits of it evil.  
  
<p> Secondly, that sin is incurable by the strength of man, nor does free will 
 have any validity here, so that even the saints say: The evil which I do not 
 wish, this I do [Rom 7:19] and Gal 5:17: You are not doing the things which 
 you wish, [Ps 38:8]. Since my loins are filled with illusions, etc.  
  
<p> Thirdly, that is, what we all feel in desiring, being angry, especially 
 when confronted by obstacles [<b>objectis praesentibus</b>], as the Lord  
 says concerning a defective eye [Matt 6:23], etc. Therefore I said essential, 
 because we contracted it through birth, and it remains always, nor does it 
 pass by anywhere, inasmuch as it is actual, inasmuch as a spring, potion, or 
 water is naturally salted with salt [<b>sicut fons, venenum aut aqua salis 
 naturaliter salsa est</b>], as a leprous body has naturally of such a kind and 
 a blind body likewise. I am not dealing here with logic.  
  
<p> The righteousness contrary to this is likewise natal, essential, original, 
 alien, which is the righteousness of Christ [John 3:5], Unless he will have 
 been reborn out of water and spirit. Likewise John 1:12: As many as 
 received him, he gave to them power to become sons of God. And 1 John 
 3:9: He who has been born out of God, does not keep on sinning (that is, is 
 not a sinner), but the generation of God preserves him [Rom 5:18-19] 
 through the righteousness of one human into all humans into the 
 justification of life, and through the obedience of one human many are 
 constituted righteous.  
  
<p> This is concerning what I have just spoken about, what sort it should be, 
 capital, foundation, our rock and our whole substance, in which we glory 
 into eternity, as the Apostle says, because our life is hidden together with 
 Christ in God [Col 3:3], and again: that we might be the righteousness of 
 God in that one [2 Cor 5:21], and in 1 Cor 1:30: other foundation no one can 
 lay.  
  
<p> Secondly, this becomes ours through faith [Rom 1:17], the righteous one 
 lives out of faith, and Rom 10:10, With the heart it is believed to 
 righteousness. This [righteousness] is conferred through baptism, this 
 is properly what the Gospel announces, and is not the righteousness of the 
 law, but the righteousness of grace.  
  
<p> Thirdly, he who has this [righteousness], even if he should sin, is not being 
 damned [Ps 89:31, 32, should they have sinned, etc. For here is the 
 spoiled son (as it is said), who cannot offend whatever he shall have 
 done. [Ps 25:10]. The universal ways of the Lord are mercy and truth. 
 
<p> Fourthly, through this [righteousness] a human being becomes lord of all 
 things, because his righteousness looks down from heaven [Psalm 85:11, 
 12], and here righteousness and truth meet each other, righteousness and 
 peace kiss, for truth springs up from the ground. For without mercy a human 
 being is a hypocrite, without righteousness he is restless. Grace makes 
 [him] truthful, righteous, and true righteousness [makes] peace: but that 
 truth is Christ, a human being [is] deceit. 
  
<p> Fifthly, the Apostle says [Rom 5:14]: that Adam is the pattern of the 
 future one, obviously in the same way that Adam by one sin, certainly 
 alien to them, by that same sin, as properly their own sin, makes all born 
 out of him answerable and gives them what he has, so Christ by means of 
 His own righteousness, that same righteousness of his own, alien to them 
 and unmerited, makes all those born out of him righteous and saved ones, 
 so that, as we were damned by means of an alien sin, thus we might be 
 freed by an alien righteousness.  
  
<p> And so I said this essential and eternal, because it remains always and 
 does not cease anywhere as actual, in accordance with that Ps 112:9. His 
 righteousness remains into the age of the age. Only Christ is eternal: thus 
 his righteousness also is eternal, and nevertheless ours. This is the mercy 
 of God the Father, this the grace of the New Testament, by means of which 
 the Lord is sweet to those who eat him: in this [grace] we must be saved, 
 and no other. Acts 15:9 Not is a name given to us under heaven, etc. Ps 31:2, 
 In your righteousness free me, and: God, in your name make me safe, etc.  
 [Ps 54:3], This is what I said: No one is saved by his own name itself, but 
 as a member of a class (that is not as Peter, Paul, John, but as Christian), 
 as it says John 3:13, no one ascends into heaven unless he descends, the 
 son of man, who is in heaven, concerning which I have just spoken more 
 fully.  
 
<p><b>THE THIRD</b><br>  
 sin is actual, which is the fruit of original. These surely are our own 
 personal sins, namely all the works which we do, even righteousnesses 
 prior to faith, according to the Apostle Rom 2:21 and 3:10, 11. You 
 therefore who teach another, do you not teach yourself? and again: there is 
 none righteous, there is none who understands, and again: for you who judge  
 practise the same things, for in whatever you judge another, you condemn 
 yourself, and in this the evil of original sin is increased (Rom 2:1), nor 
 nevertheless can it be avoided by means of one's own strength.  
  
<p> The righteousness contrary to this is actual ["act-ive"], which flows out of 
 faith and essential righteousness, concerning which the Apostle says 
 [1 Cor 15:49]: As we have born the image of the man of dust, we shall also 
 bear the image of the heavenly man, and in Ps 85:13. Righteousness will 
 go before him (that is, there are righteous ones in work before him) and 
 shall make his footsteps our pathway. And concerning that we must now 
 speak at greater length, where I stopped before.  
  
<p> First, these works are said to be meritorious: I do not know whether they 
 understand this, I confess that I had not understood it. Faith is the whole 
 merit: it is a mere empty conceit, that one single fleeting action should be 
 worth eternal life: it is necessary that the person be worthy. Christ merited 
 for us and has donated, and donates it daily.  
  
<p> Secondly, how it can be merit, when in fact all the saints sin, according to 
 this: Do not enter into judgment with your servant [Ps 143:2]; and Christ 
 [Matt 7:11]: If you, then being evil, and, [Matt 6;12]: Forgive for us our 
 debts, and Blessed Augustine: woe to the life of men, however 
 praiseworthy it might be, if it is judged without mercy. Yet on the other 
 hand [2 Cor 5:10]: That each one may receive the things done in the body, 
 and 2 Chron 15:7: For your work shall be rewarded and Gen 15:1: I am your 
 shield, your exceedingly great reward , and Eccl 9:7, Go, eat your bread 
 with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already 
 accepted your works. Finally, let every Christian beware, lest he ever be 
 uncertain, whether his works please God (for he who so doubts, sins and 
 destroys all his works and labours in vain), but it is necessary that he 
 believe that he pleases God, as the Apostle says: For our boasting is this: 
 the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in this world 
 without reproach in simplicity and godly sincerity [2 Cor 1:12], and again:  
 [1 Cor 9:26]: Therefore I run thus: not with uncertainty. Thus I fight: not as 
 one who beats the air; and Peter [2 Pet 1:10] Be diligent through good 
 works to make your calling and election sure. For he who does not know or 
 doubts whether he acts well or always believes himself to be acting 
 badly, always sins and destroys his whole life, because he is acting not 
 out of faith nor in faith.  
  
<p> What therefore are we to do? How can we simultaneously plead 
 against sentence of condemnation and seek glory? It is responded: The 
 Cherubim enlighten us with their adverse faces; for these are contrary by 
 means of face [Angesicht], but come together into the place of atonement 
 by means of sight [Zuschauen]. Thus those authorities contrary among 
 themselves agree in Christ. Thus our works, if you look at them alone, are 
 sins, and thus sentence of judgment is to be pleaded against by you (that 
 is, if they should be discussed alone, without Christ), but you trust that 
 in Christ, those things are pleasing to God, which are not themselves alone 
 able to please, as the Church prays. Accordingly, whether you sin or not,  
 you always steadfastly lean upon Christ and that natural righteousness.  
 For seven times in a day the righteous one falls and rises as often [Prov 
 24:16], and Ps 37:24: Although the righteous one shall have fallen, he is 
 not hurt; for the LORD puts his own hand forth. 
  
<p> Thirdly, what works are chiefly to be done? I reply: Especially those which 
 promote chief righteousness and decrease original sin: thus to each and 
 every one is the appropriate examination necessary of his own thing, 
 because original sin expresses itself in one person so, and in another thus, 
 The general things are prayers, alms, fasting, finally Rom 12 most 
 beautifully of all things, and elsewhere: Mortify your members [Col 3:5]. 
 Because from that third righteousness nothing else is sought, than that 
 original sin be overcome, and the body of sin destroyed, and thus the 
 reigning righteousness itself be a merit, not however because the act 
 have a reward, but only advances the merit.  
  
<p> Fourthly, before all things, guard yourself from works elected by yourself, 
 because these do not purge sins, but rather pollute, as are in our time 
 ceremonies, prayers, little speeches [<b>voculae</b>], structures of the 
 churches. Thus those works rather purify which God imposes and names: 
 hence of all the best are sufferings, adversities, penury, ignominies, death, 
 because here alone God works and man suffers, and most perfectly Adam is 
 killed, and Christ the vine is purified and his vine is dressed [John 15]. For 
 this is the best way to salvation, difficult to walk, but quite happily in the 
 end.
