Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
A social statement...
FOR PEACE
IN GOD’S WORLD
Adopted by more than a two-thirds majority vote (803-30) as a social
statement of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America by the fourth
Churchwide Assembly on August 20, 1995, at Minneapolis, Minnesota.
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America share with the Church
of Jesus Christ in all times and places the calling to be peacemakers.  In
the liturgy of Holy Communion we pray “for the peace of the whole
world,” asking, “Lord, have mercy.”  Our petition unites faith in the Triune
God with our world’s sufferings and hopes.
At the end of a tumultuous and violent century, we share with people
everywhere hope for a more peaceful and just world.   With this statement
on international peace, we strive to strengthen our global perspective as
individual Christians and as a church body, in spite of strong currents that
push us to turn in on ourselves.  As our world discards the mind-set of the
Cold War and faces the new threats and opportunities of a changing time,
we join with others in searching for what makes for peace.
Most importantly, this statement recalls that the basis of the Church’s
peace-calling is in God’s final peace, the peace of God’s eternal reign.
That calling is to proclaim the Gospel of God’s final peace and to work for
earthly peace.  This statement understands earthly peace to mean
relationships among and within nations that are just, harmonious, and free
from war.  It offers direction as we act to keep and to build earthly peace
on the eve of a new millennium.
We are grateful for the legacy of peacemaking given to our church by its
predecessor communities.1  We confess that too often we have fallen short
in our responsibility for peace.  We pray for forgiveness, and for the faith
that in love acts for earthly peace.  We dedicate ourselves anew to pray and
to work for peace in God’s world.

1.   THE GOD OF PEACE
The biblical narrative reveals God’s resolve for peace.
God created all things and gives unity, order, and purpose to a world of
different creatures.  All humans are created in the image of God (Genesis
1:27), made for life in community—with God, with others, and with the
rest of creation.
All humans also are bound together in sin.  Sin, the rupture in our relation
with God, profoundly disrupts creation.  Centeredness in self, rather than
in God, destroys the bonds of human community.  In bondage to sin, we
fall captive to fear.  Sin entangles our social structures. The Bible describes
the power of sin: ingratitude, deceit, distrust, hatred, greed, envy, arrogance,
sloth, corruption, debauchery, aggression, cruelty, oppression, and injustice.
These violate community and generate killing and war.
God nonetheless preserves the world, limiting the effects of sin, bringing
good even out of evil and making earthly peace possible.  Through the
Law, the sovereign God of the nations holds all responsible for their
neighbor, protects community, and blesses creation ever anew.  God
works often in hidden and inscrutable ways. God’s judgment comes upon
a sinful humanity for failure to live together justly and peacefully, and calls
all to repentance and faith in God.  God’s just wrath against all that causes
chaos and destruction is in the service of the divine resolve for peace.
God’s resolve for peace was manifested in a new way through one people,
chosen to be a blessing to all.  Through the people of Israel, God acted so
as to reconcile creation, promising a reign in which peace and justice will
kiss each other (Psalm 85).
God’s promise is fulfilled in Jesus Christ.  Rejected by humans, Jesus was
confirmed by God who raised him from the dead in the power of the Holy
Spirit, so that “on earth” there might be “peace” (Luke 2:14).  In bringing
this peace,
◆
Jesus taught love for one’s enemies;
◆
he reached out to the oppressed, downtrodden, and rejected
of the earth;
◆
he prayed for his enemies while himself being rejected on the
cross;
-3-
◆
above all, through Jesus’ violent death, God redeemed the
world, “for...while we were enemies, we were reconciled to
God through the death of his Son” (Romans 5:10).
This reconciling love of enemy discloses how deeply peace is rooted in
who God is.  The cross of Christ enacts God’s resolve for peace once-for-
all.  “The God of peace”2 suffers with and for a suffering and sinful world
so that all of creation will enjoy the loving community of Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit.
“The Gospel of peace” (Ephesians 6:15) heals our broken relationship
with God, removing the ultimate root of violence and injustice.  The
Gospel breaks down the dividing walls of hostility among people, creates
a new humanity—making Christ Jesus “our peace” (Ephesians 2:13-
22)—and promises the reconciliation of all things in Christ.3  The peace
of the Gospel is the final peace God intends for all.  The baptized
community already takes part in this peace through the Word and faith as
it hopes for creation’s fulfillment in “a new heaven and a new earth” where
death and pain “will be no more” (Revelation 21:1, 4).
God’s steadfast resolve for peace encompasses our time as it does all
times.  In creation and redemption, through Law and Gospel, God’s
faithful love acts for peace.
2.   THE CHURCH, A COMMUNITY FOR PEACE
A.   Divine Calling
Through the Gospel, the Holy Spirit calls and gathers a people from all
nations to worship and witness to the God of peace.  The called and
gathered are sinners, forgiven and righteous on account of Jesus Christ.
In publicly gathering to proclaim and celebrate God’s Gospel of
peace, the Church uniquely contributes to earthly peace.  Its most valuable
mission for peace is to keep alive news of God’s resolve for peace,
declaring that all are responsible to God for earthly peace and announcing
forgiveness, healing, and hope in the name of Jesus Christ.  In praying for
peace in the world, in interceding for all who suffer from war and injustice
and for those in authority, the Church acts for peace.
-4-
The vastly different Christian communities of faith that gather in all parts
of the globe are one in the Gospel, called “to maintain the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace” (Ephesians 4:1-6).  The Church, with a
diversity of gifts, contributes to earthly peace in living the oneness we
have received—in our congregations, in our church body, and in the
Church universal.  Nonetheless, divisions among competing groups
(1 Corinthians 1:10-17) and human differences frequently outweigh our
oneness in Christ (Galatians 3:28) and abuse our divine calling.
Where the Church does live in unity, overcoming such divisions and
welcoming the stranger and outcast, the Church contributes to earthly peace.
Where the followers of Jesus refuse to repay evil with evil but turn the other
cheek and go the extra mile (Matthew 5:38-42), where in their life together
Christians’ creative, nonviolent responses to hostile acts open up possibilities
for reconciliation, the Church contributes to earthly peace.  Where churches
in different countries work in solidarity for human dignity, the Church
contributes to earthly peace.  Peace in the community of faith serves by
example the ministry and message of reconciliation entrusted to the Church
for the world (2 Corinthians 5:18-19).  “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
will be called children of God” (Matthew 5:9).
By equipping the faithful to act for peace in all their communities,
the Church contributes to earthly peace.  In recalling our identity in
baptism, in gathering in peace around the Lord’s Table, in telling the
biblical narrative, in teaching faith, hope, and love, the Church provides
the basics of peacemaking for all of life.  The Church is the school of the
Holy Spirit, who molds and equips us to be peacemakers.  “The fruit of
the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness,
gentleness, and self-control” (Galatians 5:22).  With its ministry of Word
and Sacrament, the Church sustains believers in their conscientious
decisions, including people who serve in the military and defense industries,
and people who refuse to participate in all wars or in a particular war.
B.   Faithful Presence
When the Church fulfills the mandates of its divine calling, it helps in word
and deed to create an environment conducive to peace.  When the Church
forsakes these mandates, it also fails to serve earthly peace.  Through
faithfulness in its life and activities as a community for peace, the Church
in the power of the Holy Spirit becomes a presence for peace that disturbs,
reconciles, serves, and deliberates.
-5-
The Church is a disturbing presence when it refuses to be silent and
instead speaks the truth in times when people shout out, “‘Peace, peace,’
when there is no peace” (Jeremiah 6:14).  The Church is this presence
when it names and resists idols that lead to false security, injustice, and war,
and calls for repentance.  We therefore denounce beliefs and actions that:
◆
elevate our nation or any nation or people to the role of God;
◆
find ultimate security in weapons and warfare;
◆
ordain the inherent right of one people, race, or civilization to
rule over others;
◆
promise a perfect, peaceful society through the efforts of a
self-sufficient humanity; and
◆
despair of any possibility for peace.
As a reconciling presence, the Church creates bonds among different
peoples, whether local or distant.  It has special opportunities to bring
conflicting parties together and to keep tenuous lines of communication
open during times of crisis and war.  The Church serves reconciliation by
countering religious movements—including ones claiming to be Christian—
that preach and practice hate and violence, by challenging stereotypes of
“the enemy,” and by encouraging imaginative solutions to conflicts.
The Church is called to be a serving presence in society.  The Church
serves when it holds power accountable, advocates justice, stands with
those who are poor and vulnerable, provides sanctuary, and meets human
need.  The Church serves when it supports efforts by governments and
others to secure a just peace and when it encourages public debate about
what is right and good in international and domestic affairs.  It serves by
calling for compassion in meeting human needs.
The Church as a community for peace is also to be a deliberating presence
in society.  As a community of moral deliberation,4  the Church is a setting of
freedom and respect where believers with different perspectives may learn
from one another in the unity of faith.  Issues that shape our world—including
dilemmas 
of 
military 
service 
and 
confronting 
human 
evil 
through 
nonviolence—
are proper themes for discussion in the Church.
The Holy Spirit calls the Church to be a community for peace, yet, as that
community, we fall short and contradict our calling.  God’s disturbing
Word comes especially to us, judging us and calling us to confession and
repentance.   At the cross of Christ, the Church stands with the whole world
-6-
under God’s judgment and mercy.  Daily we must return to our
baptism, die again with Christ to sin’s power, and be raised anew to live
by the Spirit.
3.   IN GOD’S WORLD, A FAITH...
A.   Active for Peace
Trust in God’s promise of final peace freely given in Jesus Christ alone
drives us to engage fully in the quest to build earthly peace.  Yet we know
this quest is complex and our accomplishments provisional.  Faith in the
crucified and risen Lord strengthens us to persist even when God seems
absent in a violent and unjust world, and when weariness and hopelessness
threaten to overwhelm us.
Through the cross of Christ, God calls us to serve the needs of our
neighbor, especially of those groups and individuals who suffer and are
vulnerable.  The cross assures us that even in our vulnerability, suffering,
and death, God’s power is active through us.  In the cross we recognize that
forgiveness, reconciliation, and love of enemy are essential to our efforts
to build earthly peace.
Our everyday communities form the arena where faith acts in love for
peace.  God calls us to be peacemakers in and through the many
overlapping circles of communities through which God gives us life: our
homes and friendships, neighborhoods and work places, congregations
and volunteer associations, towns and cities, nations and international
communities.  As citizens we are to seek to influence our nation’s actions
for peace among the nations.  Sharing a common humanity with all people,
we are called to work for peace throughout the globe.
Our many communities mutually influence one another.  Attitudes,
loyalties, and commitments learned in families help shape our views of
other peoples and nations.  War may disrupt and even devastate family life.
Efforts to create just and secure communities within our nation go hand-
in-hand with the pursuit of peace among nations.5
Because Christians act for peace in varied settings, our responsibilities,
experiences, interests, and perspectives differ.  We often disagree on how
to build earthly peace, but biblical insight provides a common context for
discerning direction.
-7-
B.   Guided by Biblical Insight
In faith we receive our world as God’s creation.  We affirm therefore that
earthly peace is built on the recognition of the unity and goodness of
created existence, the oneness of humanity, and the dignity of every
person.  Peace is difference in unity.  It requires both respect for the
uniqueness of others—finite persons in particular communities—and
acknowledgement of a common humanity.  We advocate an earthly peace
that builds on freedom and responsibility, encourages compassion, and
embraces justice and care of the earth.
Because all are sinners before God, efforts to build earthly peace must
recognize sin’s persistent, pervasive, and subtle power.  We easily
deceive ourselves about our own righteousness.  Even our best intentions
can produce harmful results.  Our efforts must take account of the human
tendency to dominate and destroy, and must recognize those “principalities”
and “powers” (Ephesians 6:12, RSV) that cause strife in our world.  We
also advocate an earthly peace that provides security from violence and
aggression, seeks just order in place of tyranny or anarchy, checks
unrestrained power, and defends and enhances the life of people who are
poor and powerless.
In spite of human enmity––toward God, among humans, and with the rest
of creation—God continues to work through people, their communities
and structures, to make earthly peace possible.  We therefore cooperate
with and learn from others, and we value the God-given knowledge,
wisdom, virtue, imagination, and creativity found among all peoples.  We
support structures and processes for ordering relationships that are
sufficiently just, open, and dynamic for people to confront injustice and
conflict nonviolently.
Because we are created as whole persons, building earthly peace
encompasses all the dimensions of human society.  These dimensions
include the patterns of beliefs and values that give meaning to life (culture,
including religion), the structures and practices that sustain life (economics),
as well as the structures and processes that allow communities to make and
enforce decisions (politics).   We believe that God works through human
culture, economics, and politics, and intends them to restrain evil and
promote the common good.
-8-
Earthly peace is not the same as the promised peace of God’s present
and future eternal reign.  As a human achievement built in the middle
of strife, earthly peace is often fleeting and always partial.  It is difficult to
build and maintain.  It is easily and frequently disrupted by violence and
war.  All the more, then, is earthly peace a most precious gift.  It embodies
God’s intention for creation, serves human and planetary good, and gives
space to proclaim the Gospel, keeping hope in God alive.
C.   Lived in Our Time
In hope we live out our faith in community with others and together strive
for earthly peace.  As we do so, we experience a world that is increasingly
interconnected.  People work, buy, and sell in a global market.  The media
make us present at happenings around the world, and new communication
technologies increase available information.  Economic and technological
developments make increased integration both possible and necessary.
The global dangers of nuclear weapons, environmental degradation, and
population pressure also create greater interdependence.  International
trafficking in illegal drugs contributes to violence in all parts of the world.
All people experience these global changes from within particular and
limited communities.  The movement toward greater integration affects
the world’s diverse communities differently—from threatening their
identity and existence to enhancing their life.  Different communities
respond differently to the changes.  Integration often accentuates the
attention people give to their particular communities.  Familial, religious,
cultural, ethnic, and national communities continue to be decisive sources
for peoples’ sense of belonging, outlook, and perception of their interests.
The tension-filled interplay of these two dynamics—here called integration
and particularity—shape today’s quest for peace.  Integration promises
broader global community; particularity promises deeper personal
community.  Integration threatens to bring inequality and domination by
unaccountable power; particularity threatens to bring fragmentation and
violent conflict by groups that deny the humanity of those who differ from
them.  Recognizing both promise and threat, we seek an earthly peace that
affirms unity in our diversity.
Good and evil are intricately interwoven in the interplay of these two
dynamics.  The benefits of unparalleled economic development in some
-9-
parts of the world contrast with unrelenting poverty in others.  The impact
of a global economy on local communities varies.  Basic cultural questions
become even more important as the encounter of cultures intensifies.  In
and among religions there exist increased dialogue and mutual
understanding.  But there also are splintering, intense hostility toward
other groups, and support for violent crusades against the enemy.
States, vastly unequal in their power, exercise their sovereignty in a
thickening web of international organizations and agreements, regionally
and globally.  Economic integration diminishes governments’ ability to
determine their own economic policies.  National borders are ever more
permeable by outside influences.  The movement of people across borders
due to war or poverty is massive and controversial.  Moreover, numerous
states face disintegration from within when minority groups, usually
ethnic communities, seek their own state or autonomy.  In vicious civil
wars civilians often are targeted by armed groups.  Such wars raise new
questions about what, if anything, the international community can and
should do in the face of internal conflicts.
4.   POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY
A.   Acting As Citizens
We recognize the awesome responsibility political leaders, policy makers,
and diplomats have for peace in our unsettled time.  In a democracy all
citizens share in this responsibility.  We encourage participation by
Christians in the affairs of government.
Our faith as Christians gives a distinctive quality to our life as citizens.
Love born of faith calls us not to harm others and to help them in every
need.  The Scriptures provide us direction.  Yet we do not possess uniquely
Christian international policies or a divine or biblical politics for our
nation. For political guidance we also must rely upon reason and compas-
sion, and examine and draw upon common human experience through
which, we believe, God is at work creating and preserving the world.
For the welfare of our neighbors, we in company with others must press
for what is right and good within the limits and possibilities of the actual
situation.  Leaders and citizens make decisions among many competing
goods and interests when not all can be realized.  In the uncertain task of
-10-
calculating the probable outcomes of these decisions and choosing the
best alternative, we must view the desired ends of action in light of the
means and resources available.
Political authority relies on both the consent of the people and the threat
and use of coercion.  In accordance with the Lutheran tradition,6 we affirm
that governments may legitimately employ such measures as law and its
enforcement, police protection, provisions for the common defense, and
resistance to aggression.  We also affirm that governments should vigor-
ously pursue less coercive measures over more coercive ones: consent
over compulsion, nonviolence over violence, diplomacy over military
engagement, and deterrence over war.
With its significant economic, political, cultural, and military power, the
United States plays a vital leadership role in world affairs.  It cannot and
should not withdraw or isolate itself from the rest of the world.  Neither
should it seek to control or police the world.  Global challenges cannot be
addressed by the United States alone; yet few can be met without the
United States’ participation.
In pursuing their interests, all nations, including the United States, have an
obligation to respect the interests of other states and international actors
and to comply with international law.  Nations should seek their own
common good in the context of the global common good.  International
bodies should work for the welfare of all nations.
Citizens need to give careful attention to how we in the United States
perceive our national interest and interpret our national identity, since what
states do depends in large measure on their views of their own interests and
identity.  Sin’s power often makes itself felt in arrogant and self-righteous
views of national identity, and in narrow, short-term, and absolute views
of national interest.
We call for an imaginative attention to the interests and welfare of other
nations, especially of those that are viewed as “enemies” or that are
considered unimportant for our nation’s interests.  We expect expressions
of our nation’s identity to build on the best of our traditions, to respect
others’ identity, and to open up paths for mutual understanding.  For the
sake of a greater good or for reasons of conscience, citizens may need to
oppose a prevailing understanding or practice of national identity and
interest.  Citizens may even need to resist oppressive government.
-11-
B.   Deciding about Wars
Wars, both between and within states, represent a horrendous failure of
politics.  The evil of war is especially evident in the number of children and
other noncombatants who suffer and die.  We lament that the Church has
blessed crusades and wars in the name of Jesus Christ.  We recognize with
sorrow that too often people formed in the Lutheran tradition have
passively accepted their government’s call-to-arms or have too readily
endorsed war to resolve conflicts.
First and foremost, love of neighbor obligates us to act to prevent wars and
to seek alternatives to them, especially in view of modern weapons and
their proliferation.  For this reason, this statement focuses on building a
just peace and identifies tasks that create conditions for peace.  Yet wars
and their threat still thrust themselves upon us, and we cannot avoid
making decisions about them.
In doing so, we face conflicting moral claims and agonizing dilemmas.
Helping the neighbor in need may require protecting innocent people from
injustice and aggression.  While we support the use of nonviolent measures,
there may be no other way to offer protection in some circumstances than
by restraining forcibly those harming the innocent.  We do not, then—for
the sake of the neighbor—rule out possible support for the use of military
force.  We must determine in particular circumstances whether or not
military action is the lesser evil.
We seek guidance from the principles of the “just/unjust war” tradition.
While permitting recourse to war in exceptional circumstances, these
principles intend to limit such occasions by setting forth conditions that
must be met to render military action justifiable.  We begin with a strong
presumption against all war; support for and participation in a war to
restore peace is a tragic concession to a sinful world.  Any decision for war
must be a mournful one.
The principles for deciding about wars include right intention, justifiable
cause, legitimate authority, last resort, declaration of war aims, propor-
tionality, and reasonable chance of success.  The principles for conducting
war include noncombatant immunity and proportionality.7  The principles
for post-war conduct include showing mercy to the defeated and assisting
them to rebuild. Justifiable national and international commitment of
forces to armed conflicts depend on adherence to these principles.
-12-
This approach incorporates the hope that even war may be subject to
political ends (peace) and moral considerations.  At their best, these
principles provide a moral framework, ambiguous and imprecise though
it be, for public deliberation about war, and guidance for persons deciding
what to do when faced with the dilemmas of war.  In using them, Christians
need to be prepared to say “no” to wars in which their nation participates.
These principles are important in international law and in military codes
of conduct.  They are the basis for our church’s unequivocal rejection of
nuclear war8 and for its support for “selective conscientious objection.”9
In taking this approach to war, this church supports the vocation of men
and women in the military who in conscience directly face the ambiguities
of relative evils, and who may suffer and die to defend their neighbor.
From the posture of the just/unjust war tradition, the aim of all politics is
peace.  Any political activity that involves coercion should be held
accountable to just/unjust war principles.  They are important for evaluating
movements, sanctions, embargoes, boycotts, trade policies to reward or
punish, and other coercive but nonviolent measures.
The Church and others often fail to teach and apply the just/unjust war
principles.  These principles can be and have been misused in self-serving
ways.  As an evolving tradition, these principles need constant testing in
light of the changing nature of warfare.  Their proper use depends on
political wisdom and historical knowledge of the situation.   We affirm this
approach humbly and self-critically.  We encourage further deliberation
about its faithfulness and adequacy.
Another voice with deep historical roots in the Christian tradition also
speaks in our church.  This church today needs the witness of its members
who in the name of Jesus Christ refuse all participation in war, who commit
themselves to establish peace and justice on earth by nonviolent power
alone, and who may suffer and die in their discipleship.  We support
members who conscientiously object to bearing arms in military service.
We must continue the perennial discussion in the Church universal about
whether Christian love and discipleship prohibit participation in war in all
circumstances, or whether they may permit it in some circumstances.  This
discussion poses important and difficult biblical, historical, theological,
and ethical questions.  Even when Christians may differ on these questions,
-13-
there is still a basis for practical cooperation in their common presumption
against violence and commitment to peace.
We make decisions about participation in war knowing that what we do or
do not do falls short of what love requires.  No matter what conscientious
people decide, they remain under God’s judgment and in need of God’s
mercy given in the cross of Christ.
5.   TASKS
What should we do to keep, make, and build international peace today?
This section identifies tasks and arenas for action.  It draws out implications
of our faith and incorporates judgments of reason, which always are open
to development and correction.  Naming these tasks voices our hope that
international relations can be ordered in ways that contribute to a just, free,
secure, and nonviolent world.  Yet we pursue this hope within the
constraints and brokenness of our complex world.
A.   A Culture of Peace
Foster a dynamic vision of difference in unity.  All people in their
amazing diversity are God’s creatures, sinners for whom Christ died.  In
a time when increasing integration endangers the bonds of communities
and when an idolatrous allegiance to one’s own community endangers our
oneness, we must voice with clarity the powerful vision of difference in
unity.  This vision calls us to engage differences, not to ignore or fear them.
The hope for earthly peace challenges people to strengthen their own
particular communities in ways that promote respect and appreciation for
people in other communities, for all share a common humanity.  We urge
our congregations to promote understanding through people-to-people
exchanges.
In many situations today, religious differences are a source of enmity.
Religion is used to incite people to violence. The Church faces new
challenges in being a reconciling presence among the religions of the
world.  We need to learn from Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and
others, discovering the ways they strive for peace, correcting distorted
images, and working for mutual understanding.10   We rejoice where
people of different religions work together to overcome hostility.
-14-
Promote respect for human rights.  “Recognition of the inherent dignity
and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family
is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.”  These words
from the Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)
are consistent with our understanding of humans created in God’s image.
Human rights provide a common universal standard of justice for living
with our differences, and they give moral and legal standing to the
individual in the international community.
We therefore will continue to teach about human rights, protest their
violation, advocate their international codification, and support effective
ways to monitor and ensure compliance with them.  Our priorities are to:
◆
oppose genocide and other grievous violations of human
rights such as torture, religious and racial oppression, forced
conscription (impressment), forced labor, and war crimes
(including organized rape);
◆
provide for the most basic necessities of the poor; and
◆
defend the human rights of groups most susceptible to
violations, especially all minorities, women, and children.
Counter and transform attitudes that encourage violence.  A significant
cause of violent conflict, domestically and internationally, are attitudes
that view violence as a readily acceptable way of dealing with differences
and disputes.  Fear of others, disregard for people’s dignity, personal
experiences of violence, and images in movies, television, videos, and
music that glorify violence and war help form these attitudes.11
The Gospel strikes at the heart of what promotes such attitudes, freeing us
from fear to see others as brothers and sisters for whom Christ died and
lives.  The media should depict honestly the violence, brutality, and terror
of war and should expose falsehoods.  We encourage efforts in education,
the arts, and communication to portray the beauty and goodness of peace
and to enhance appreciation of our world’s diversity.
Strengthen the will and ability to resolve conflicts peacefully.
Disagreements, conflicts, and competition among nations, groups, and
individuals are inevitable, but wars are not.  One essential ingredient for
reducing the likelihood of war is the steady resolve and intense effort of
the parties involved to settle conflict nonviolently.  Another essential
ingredient is the ability to explore all avenues for common interests, to
-15-
compromise interests, to conciliate differences, and to prevent, moderate,
or isolate destructive conflicts.  These ingredients are as vital for resolving
conflict in international diplomacy as they are in families and communities.
We renew our commitment to carry on this peace task through education
and practice, especially with children and youth.  We call upon nations to
provide leadership, education, structures, and funds for the peaceful
resolution of conflict.  Nations should do so with the same commitment
that they prepare people to settle disputes with military force.
B.   An Economy with Justice
Insist that peace and economic justice belong together.  Massive
hunger and poverty, alongside abundance and wealth, violate the bonds of
our common humanity.  Such economic disparities are a cause of conflict
and war and spur our efforts to build just economic relationships necessary
for peace.   Justice points toward an economy ordered in ways that:
◆
respect human dignity;
◆
provide the necessities of life;
◆
distribute goods and burdens fairly and equitably; and
◆
are compatible with a life-sustaining ecosystem.12
Sustainable growth and fair distribution are vital in creating economic
justice.  Both should enable all to participate in the economy.  Global
economic integration should enhance economic well-being among and
within nations.  Fiscal policy, business practices, investment policies, and
personal life styles, including patterns of consumption, should contribute
to economic justice and the long-term sustainability of our planet.
Support just arrangements to regulate the international economy.  In
a world with growing economic integration and political fragmentation,
global enterprises are increasingly unaccountable to either national or
international standards.  This lack of accountability can be a source of
injustice and violent conflict.
We support efforts by nations to improve regulation and coordination of
the global economy through reciprocal and mutually advantageous
arrangements.  International trade and financial agreements should help to
increase partnership, prevent commercial wars among nations, protect the
environment, provide assistance with debt management, check abuse by
-16-
multinational companies, and protect poorer nations.  Developing countries
need better opportunities to foster capital investment and to profit through
fair and open trade.
Revitalize Aid.  We affirm that our nation has responsibility to contribute
a portion of its wealth to people in poorer nations through effective
economic assistance.  Assistance should come in the form of both
humanitarian aid needed to relieve the consequences of disasters and
development assistance that contributes to improvements in the quality of
life in developing economies.  While the United States has been generous
in providing humanitarian aid, our nation dramatically trails the rest of the
industrialized world in providing development assistance relative to our
production of wealth.13  We support continued and increased assistance by
the United States, and call for its gradual realignment toward more
development assistance and a proportional reduction in subsidies to
purchase weapons.
The guiding purpose of economic assistance should be to reduce hunger
and poverty in sustainable and environmentally sound ways.  Aid should
be provided in ways that promote human rights and build self-reliant
individuals, communities, and nations.  Aid should be responsive to the
need of many countries to reduce population pressure through greater
opportunity for women and through voluntary, safe, and reliable means of
birth control.  Aid also should require accountability on the part of
recipient governments.  We support bilateral and multilateral aid and the
use of non-governmental organizations as channels to reach local
communities.
Support economic conversion.  While recognizing its continuing and
changing security responsibilities, the United States should evaluate
carefully the balance between legitimate security needs and other priority
uses of government revenues, and reduce military expenditures wherever
possible.  Where reductions occur, communities, businesses, and
governments on all levels have responsibility to develop strategies that
contribute to the well-being of those who bear the greatest burden of this
economic conversion.  We encourage congregations that serve these
populations to participate in ministries of reconciliation and support to
persons in economic and professional transition.

C.   A Politics of Cooperation
Strengthen international cooperation.  Belief in a common humanity,
increasing global integration, and national self-interest all compel this
task. In the Charter of the United Nations and in other international
agreements, nations have stated how they believe their relations should be
ordered.  Normally nations comply with these principles.  States pledge to
respect the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of other states and
not to intervene in their internal affairs, and to honor the self-determination
of peoples. They also pledge to fulfill international obligations, to coop-
erate with other states, and to settle disputes peacefully.  While states have
the right of self-defense and may resist aggression, they are otherwise to
abstain from the threat or use of military force.14 At present, such principles
offer the best framework for a just ordering of international relations. Citizens
have responsibility to hold governments accountable to these principles.
As is evident in internal conflicts today, however, the principles of international
law are at times in conflict.  For example, when a state massively violates the
fundamental rights and freedoms of its people, particularly with acts of
genocide, does the principle of nonintervention still hold?  In our judgment it
does not.  Because of its responsibility for human rights, the international
community, through its regional and global organizations, has an obliga-
tion to respond and a right to intervene, with military force if necessary.
Yet any such intervention must be carried out with extreme caution and be
accountable to the principles of the just/unjust war tradition.
In support for international cooperation, we:
◆
call for building confidence among nations through forms of
state conduct that are legal, nonviolent, truthful, reliable, and
open, and for minimizing all forms of covert action;
◆
advocate increased respect for and adherence to international
law;
◆
support viable, long-term efforts to strengthen the United
Nations as a forum for international cooperation and peace,
including the International Court of Justice,15 and regional
courts;
◆
support creation of an International Criminal Court, which would
hold individuals accountable for violations of international law,
for example, in cases of genocide and war crimes; and
◆
encourage continuing deliberation on the international
community’s responsibility for internal conflicts.
-18-
Improve structures of common security.  In an increasingly integrated
world nations cannot and should not seek only their own security.  Their
goal should be common or mutually assured security.  Cultural interaction
and political and economic cooperation can contribute to common
security, as can stable balances of power and defensive alliances.
Collective regional and global security structures are also needed.  We
affirm the original vision and mandate of collective security given to the
United Nations and its Security Council.  We encourage sober assessment
of the successes and failures of international peacemaking efforts.  We
support, without illusions, efforts to make stronger and more effective the
work of the United Nations and regional bodies in preventive diplomacy,
peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding.
We understand that the United States’ armed forces have a role in the
structures of common security.  This role requires the United States to
maintain sufficient armed forces to participate effectively in common
efforts to deter or defeat likely threats.  Although this involvement entails
a significant burden on our country, strengthening regional and global
security structures is, in our judgment, in the long-term interests of the
United States as well as other nations.
Give high priority to arms control and reduction.  We particularly urge
a sharp reduction in the number of weapons of mass destruction.  We call
for arms control agreements that are substantial, equitable, verifiable, and
progressive.16  We support mutual confidence-building measures to
improve mutually assured security.  In particular, we give priority to:
◆
agreements among the leading nuclear powers to reduce their
nuclear stockpiles and to decrease the possibility of nuclear
confrontation or accident;
◆
the successful negotiation of a renewed Nuclear Non-
proliferation Treaty, the strengthening of mechanisms to
monitor and enforce nuclear treaties, and efforts that move
toward the elimination of nuclear weapons;
◆
treaties to ban the production, sale, and use of biological and
chemical weapons; and
◆
agreements to ban the production, sale, and use of land mines.
Control and reduce the arms trade.  Heavily armed nations continue to
spend billions on arms.  As one of the world’s leading arms exporters, the
-19-
United States has special responsibility to reduce arms sales and to seek
proper international control agreements over the worldwide sale and
transfer of arms by the major exporters. We:
◆
support legislation to prohibit United States military assistance
and arms transfers to governments that use them to oppress
their own citizens or to engage in acts of aggression; and
◆
encourage international efforts to make arms sales open to
public scrutiny and to reduce the arms trade.
Advocate participatory and accountable political structures within
nations.  In view of the high number of internal wars, the concern for
political structures and processes within nations is crucial for peace.  The
success or failure of democratic efforts may have significant impact on
international peace, since historically democracies have seldom declared
war on each other.  We expect governments to be accountable to law and
people, provide for the participation of all and space for loyal opposition,
protect individual and minority rights, and offer processes for conflicts to
be resolved without war.
In support for just political structures, we:
◆
call for assistance to nations struggling to form democracies,
recognizing that in many nations grinding poverty and
population pressure are major obstacles to democracy;
◆
acknowledge that the responsible use of sanctions may on
occasion be the most effective and least harmful measure to
lead states to stop oppressing their people; and
◆
insist that one of the most important contributions the United
States can make to peace is to have its own democracy work
for a just and peaceful ordering of its diverse society.
Encourage non-governmental organizations and their work for
peace.  Freedom of association and activities of non-governmental local,
national, and international organizations are indispensable to building
peace today.  These organizations counter the abuse of state power and
mediate between individuals and organized centers of power.  Through
them, people expose serious human rights violations, respond to human
need unmet by governments, organize people who are poor and oppressed,
keep attention focused on the brutality of wars, and help resolve conflicts.
-20-
In support of non-governmental organizations, we:
◆
recognize and strive to further the role churches play as a
worldwide network of communication in the defense of
human rights;
◆
encourage people to become active supporters of one or more
such non-governmental organizations;
◆
call upon nations to protect by law and nurture in their culture
the freedom of their citizens to join together in voluntary
association; and
◆
support the emerging forms of service in which teams of
highly-trained volunteers seek peace through nonviolent
intervention in conflicted and war-torn areas of the world.17
Encourage and support nonviolent action.  In this century nonviolent
movements have impressively shown their ability to protest violence and
injustice and to bring change in situations of oppression.
We strongly support efforts to develop the potential of nonviolence to
bring about just and peaceful change, and we:
◆
call for education on nonviolence in our church and elsewhere;
◆
encourage members of our church to give conscientious
consideration to participation in nonviolent action in situa-
tions where it holds promise of being an appropriate and
effective way to bring about greater justice, calling on them to
appraise the situation with the principles of the just/unjust war
tradition;18 and
◆
provide pastoral support for those who in conscience undertake
nonviolent action for peace, including those who do so in symbolic
ways to dramatize an evil and to witness to the power of the cross
of Christ.
Care for the Uprooted.  Tens of millions are refugees in foreign lands.
At least as many are internally displaced.  In unprecedented numbers
people have had to flee their homes because of persecution or general
violence.
We support compassionate survival assistance for refugees and vigorous
international protection for them.  The world community has a responsi-
bility to aid nations that receive refugees and to help change the situations
from which they have fled.  In our own country, we support a generous
-21-
policy of welcome for refugees and immigrants.  We pledge to continue
our church’s historic leadership in caring for refugees and immigrants.
“GO IN PEACE”
The elusive quest to build earthly peace is multifaceted, and for us belongs
in a context that extends far beyond our own efforts and time.  Our faith
active for peace begins and ends with God, the alpha and omega of peace.
Living still in a time when hate, injustice, war, and suffering seem often to
have the upper hand, we call on God to fulfill the divine promise of final
peace.
“Give God no rest” (Isaiah 62:6-7) until that day when “the wolf
and the lamb shall feed together.... They shall not hurt or destroy
on all my holy mountain, says the Lord” (Isaiah 65:25).
“Give God no rest” until that day when the nations “shall beat their
swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation
shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any
more” (Isaiah 2:4).
We await the fulfillment of God’s promise of eternal peace, not in
resignation, but in grateful joy and active hope, for our time and place are
also God’s.  God, who makes earthly peace possible, calls us to gather in
worship.  Baptized into Christ, we hear the Gospel and share Holy
Communion, the foretaste of the peaceful feast to come.   The Holy Spirit
sends us into our everyday communities to be agents for peace.  We are
called to pray, and to live, for peace in God’s world.
We do the liturgy and we disperse, trusting that the peace of God in Christ
Jesus, “which surpasses all understanding” (Philippians 4:7), goes with us
and prepares us to be peacemakers.
“Go in Peace.  Serve the Lord.
Thanks be to God.”
