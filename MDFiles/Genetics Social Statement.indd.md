I.  Prologue                                                                                                                                 
Genetic science includes a range of  disciplines that deal with bio-
logically based characteristics and their inheritance.  The developments 
stemming from genetic science and its applications illustrate the abun-
dant gifts of  God’s creation.  Breakthrough discoveries and cutting-edge 
technologies evoke a sense of  awe and provide insights into the human 
place within the web of  creation.  They unlock unprecedented power to 
diagnose and cure diseases and to address agricultural and environmen-
tal problems.
These developments also exemplify how contemporary human 
knowledge and technology are creating a different relationship between 
human power and life on this planet.  Genetic science extends human 
powers over the fundamental processes of life in unprecedented and 
qualitatively different ways.  It enables human beings to shape directly and 
rapidly the characteristics of living beings, including human beings.
The collective effects of these new powers mean human beings 
increasingly bear the moral burden for the shape of nature and the very 
existence of future generations.  The cumulative force of such unparal-
leled power and choice promise great benefit but also present qualitatively 
new levels of danger and ambiguity.
A Social Statement on
Genetics, Faith and
Responsibility
*A glossary can be found at the end of the statement, which may be helpful.
This social teaching document was amended and adoped by a more than two-thirds 
vote (942-34) at the twelfth biennial Churchwide Assembly on August 18, 2011, at 
Orlando, Florida.
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) believes in 
one God, who created in the beginning, who creates now and in whom 
all things, visible and invisible, hold together (Colossians 1:3–20).  We 
confess that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit will redeem all that has been, 
is and will be—including human choices involving genetic knowledge and 
its application.
The ELCA believes that this gracious God also endows human be-
ings with insight and reasoning and calls human beings to help order and 
shape, nurture and promote the creation so that it may continue to flourish.  
This church recognizes that contemporary power, such as that arising from 
genetic science, presents human beings with choices and responsibilities for 
which human beings are accountable to God.  This power obligates us to 
a greater level of accountability, one that will be measured best by whether 
and how the whole creation continues to flourish.
In its continued effort to discern God’s will under the guidance of the 
Holy Spirit and in the light of the Holy Scriptures, the ELCA articulates 
basic convictions that should frame and guide thinking and action with 
respect to developments in genetics: 
• 
Genetic science, its meaning and its applications, represent gifts 
intended by God to contribute to the human vocation* to order 
and shape, nurture and invent.
○ History demonstrates that human activity sometimes has been 
good for the health of creation while at other times it has dam-
aged it.
○ Genetic knowledge and its applications are not morally neutral. 
 
They require diligent and sustained attention in order both to 
direct their potential good and to limit potential harm. 
○ Individual and collective decisions must take into account the 
long-term impact of genetic science and technology as well as 
the character of the world today as a global village.
• 
The vocation of the human race includes God’s call:
○ to recognize and accept our distinctive power and freedom; and
○ to take responsibility as innovative stewards who live out this 
gift and duty through various callings in daily life.
A Social Statement

• 
The age-old human reality of sin, manifested as excessive pride and 
negligence or complacency, corrupts individual and social efforts. 
• 
Contemporary power obligates human beings individually and col-
lectively to assume a greater level of accountability for the future 
of society and the natural world.
○ The moral imperative commensurate with contemporary hu-
man power is to respect and promote the community of life 
through the exercise of justice and wisdom. 
○ The sphere of moral consideration must encompass all of 
nature, not simply the immediate circle of human beings.
• 
Within these new complexities, God calls the church to renew the 
virtues and practices of koinonia (coy-no-nee-ah) or Christian com-
munity that emphasize spirited fellowship and unity in diversity.
○ Renewed emphasis on such faithful practices will strengthen 
the church as a place of compassion and care, constructive 
deliberation and dialogue.
○ New attention to Christian mutuality will support members in 
their various callings in daily life and in common efforts to take 
public action.  It also will strengthen the church’s witness to the 
need for respect, civility and dialogue in the civic realm.
• 
Earthly life is morally and spiritually ambiguous. Good and bad, 
right and wrong, sin and redemption are always mixed together. 
○ As redeemed and yet sinful people in Christ, we must speak 
and act boldly and yet in humility.
○ Christian confidence to do so lies in the certainty of God’s 
promise to be present and ultimately to bring fulfillment to this 
good creation.
The ELCA contends that morally responsible discernment about these 
matters requires knowledge and insights from both religious and secular 
sources.  This statement draws on both to provide a framework for theo-
logical reflection, public moral deliberation, congregational life, pastoral 
practice and mission-oriented action.  It focuses attention on analysis, val-
ues and convictions and not on specific issues.  Such specific issues require 
detailed attention and may change quickly as genetic science and its applica-
tions open new frontiers and pose new questions.1

II. Scientific and Social Contexts 
 
 
 
 
2.1 Genetic science and technology
The ELCA values genetic science as an expression of the human respon-
sibility to learn and predict, imagine and invent for the sake of stewarding 
creation.  The discovery of the DNA double helix, the understanding of base 
pairs and codons, the capacity for recombinant DNA and the results of the 
Human Genome Project illustrate wondrous advances to celebrate.
This church recognizes and embraces the theoretical frameworks on 
which the science of genetics rests—frameworks informed by paleontol-
ogy, biochemistry, molecular biology, embryology, physiology, anatomy and 
related fields of scientific endeavor.  These frameworks enrich our apprecia-
tion of the human place in nature and the relationship of the human spe-
cies to other parts of creation.  They enable human beings to find new ways 
to promote the community of life.
The sciences, by definition, do not constitute understandings (or imply 
judgments) about God. There is no inherent conflict between scientific 
findings and the understanding of God as creator, redeemer and sanctifier. 
Christians should celebrate the best of theoretical and practical genetic sci-
ence that explores genetic structure, function and change.
Technology, in its most fundamental sense, is “the use of knowledge 
through the mechanical arts and applied sciences to fulfill the human desire 
and disposition rationally to understand, order, predict, and (ultimately) con-
trol the events and workings of nature….”2  While overlaps between the fol-
lowing categories exist, broadly speaking it is possible to distinguish six areas 
for the application (and consequences) of genetic knowledge at this time: 
• 
Molecular medicine, including practices involving stem cell research 
and genetic therapy for humans and animals, personal genomics 
and the mapping of single nucleotide polymorphisms and efforts 
to extend the longevity of human life to as much as three times 
today’s average.
• 
Procreative activities, including prenatal testing and screening, assisted 
reproductive technologies, preimplantation genetic diagnoses and 
the artificial creation of new life forms (synthetic biology).
• 
Genetic engineering in agriculture, including practices such as genetically 
engineering seeds, cloning plants and animals and “pharming.”
A Social Statement

• 
General commercial and legal applications, including DNA testing for em-
ployment, health insurance, identification of victims after disasters or 
during criminal investigations as well as matters of trade policies and 
the patenting of genetic material and research processes.
• 
Military use, including biological weaponry and the DNA identifica-
tion of battlefield casualties.
• 
Social impact, including discrimination based on genetic profiling, the 
practice of eugenics and beliefs in genetic determinism.
Such a list illustrates why human beliefs and practices related to genetic 
knowledge bear both promise and peril.  Genetic knowledge can create 
whole new industries that respond to the ailments and misfortunes of life.  
Yet, it also carries the potential for personal and social evil, such as discrimi-
nation or the dramatic alteration of species.  It can aid agriculture, yet it 
also creates the potential for unforeseen consequences that cannot be easily 
reversed or minimized.
Genetic knowledge and technology pose new complexities and ambigui-
ties.  The benefits in the short term for one group or region may be harmful 
over the long term for a much larger group or area.  The comforting informa-
tion it provides for one individual may raise great fears for another.  The use 
of genetic knowledge will reshape the future of the delicate web of life, while 
increasingly blurring the line between what is natural and what is artificial.
2.2 The global context 
Scientific and technological developments, such as contemporary forms 
of communication, have created a global context that is relatively new in 
human history and vitally significant to any discussion of genetic knowl-
edge and its application.  Today’s complex sets of natural, intellectual, eco-
nomic and social dynamics are often depicted by the analogy of a “global 
village.”  This analogy suggests four realities:
a) The first is perhaps most commonly recognized:  all societies on 
earth are ever more closely being interconnected.  The availability 
of genetically modified products, for instance, affects not only 
what Americans eat, but also impacts the kind of seeds and farm-
ing practices available for African farmers.  There are virtually no 
isolated choices or activities that affect only one area of the global 
village any longer.  Political, economic and social decisions today, as 
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
5
well as decisions about scientific research priorities and the applica-
tion of scientific knowledge, move like ripples spreading across a 
small pond—their effects become visible everywhere.
b) Closely linked, the second aspect of the global village is the scope 
and speed at which changes are introduced.  Even a hundred years 
ago, the results of decisions about agriculture and medicine, for 
instance, were confined to local regions, and their effects spread 
gradually.  The speed of developments today, however, is key to the 
change in the relationship between human power and the rest of 
nature.  The scope and speed of change create legitimate concerns 
about the impact of those developments on human cultures and 
natural environments.
c) Knowledge and technology have never developed in a social vacu-
um, and genetic research and technology and their delivery are not 
socially neutral.  Socio-economic factors influence what research 
is funded, how the results will be distributed and, in turn, who will 
benefit most.  This means that the search for genetic knowledge 
itself, the decisions about what applications will be pursued and 
even social beliefs about their meaning must be considered in light 
of contemporary social factors.
The analogy of the “global village” points to the predicament of 
widespread inequalities across socio-economic level, country and 
region.  Global and domestic inequalities serve to limit who is 
included in discussions and evaluations of genetic science and tech-
nology.  These inequalities mean that all may not benefit equally or 
as rapidly (or at all) from genetic research and technology.
Many financially poor countries have immediate critical needs that do 
not require high technology solutions—needs such as infrastructure, 
effective food distribution, clean water, adequate housing and basic 
health care.  Voices from within the Lutheran communion, as well as 
from foreign leaders and development experts, challenge Christians 
to advocate for investments that appropriately address these elemen-
tal needs.  While there are no simple remedies in the global village to 
the problems of inequality and financially poor regions, these realities 
must be factored into contemporary dialogues about the just and 
wise use of genetic knowledge and its applications.
A Social Statement
6
d) The final reality of the “global village” concerns the institutional 
power that shapes key decisions about what are socially beneficial 
areas of study, where to expend financial and human resources, and 
where to direct the attention of genetic science research and de-
velopment.  The interactions of many actors and forces influence 
the development of genetic science and its applications.  Many key 
decisions, however, are formulated by a relatively small number of 
scientists, executives, managers and administrators in governments, 
industries and universities.3
Public dialogue and moral deliberation on questions of genetic research 
and its applications would be greatly enhanced if more people were includ-
ed and empowered to participate.  Broader public involvement is appropri-
ate, especially because many genetic applications, like other technologies, 
have long-term social, economic and political ramifications.
Reasonable people may disagree about what levels of risk are appropri-
ate and whether an outcome is beneficial.  Institutional review boards, peer 
review panels and other mechanisms of scientific oversight have been estab-
lished to protect the rights of individuals and to enhance the common good.
The presence of these institutions, however, does not necessarily elimi-
nate all instances of bias and fraud.  They do not guarantee the fair distribu-
tion of risks and benefits.  Publications in prominent scientific and medical 
journals indicate that financial and other factors can lead some scientists 
and key decision-makers to lean toward specific interest groups or toward 
more narrow concerns than the common good.4 
These four factors within the global village of human society shape 
the context in which individual and social responsibilities play out.  It is a 
significant problem that such factors are frequently ignored in public policy 
discussions or are absent from assessments of genetic developments.  The 
ELCA believes, in contrast, that these factors must be included in public 
dialogue weighing the benefits and challenges of the use of genetic knowl-
edge and its applications.
2.3 The challenge
With many others, the ELCA understands that genetics can contribute 
to creative and beneficial care for the community of life.  With others, we 
also are concerned about the potential harm.  This harm may be the result 
of unintended consequences, but it could be especially acute given the 
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
7
power of genetic science to alter existing life in direct, rapid and perhaps 
irreversible ways.
The ELCA’s concern for benefit or harm, however, is not focused per 
se on any particular scientific or technological development.  The concern, 
rather, focuses on the just and wise use of genetic knowledge and technology. 
 
For instance, the ELCA does not reject the use of genetic technology such 
as genetically modified organisms, prenatal diagnosis or pharmacogenetics.  
Like other gifts of technology, there are reasons for both encouraging their 
use and for cautioning against certain means of applying them.  This church 
believes the use of any technology should be subject to moral assessment.
The ELCA, through its members in their everyday lives and through its 
congregations, synods, churchwide expression, social ministry organizations 
and related institutions, is accountable for how it appraises and contributes 
to genetic science and its applications in this society.  Toward that end, we 
turn to the resources of faith in order to discern insights and convictions 
that will guide this church’s participation in society and its assessment of 
and engagement with changing circumstances and dilemmas.
III. Affirmations of Faith 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1 Scripture and contemporary knowledge
Holy Scriptures are the authoritative source and norm of faith and 
practice for faithfully living out our relationship to God, to each other 
and to the rest of creation. Although the books of the Bible were written 
long before developments in modern science and technology put awesome 
powers in human hands, Scripture, as the guide for Christian discernment, 
illuminates contemporary challenges and issues.
Lutherans hold that God’s word in Scripture acts upon human beings 
as law and gospel. The law presents insights for ordering a just society and 
it convicts of sin. It also points us to God’s intentions and promises as a 
sure guide by which to orient and conduct our lives.5
The gospel proclaims the wondrous grace of God embodied in Jesus 
Christ to redeem and set us free to love God and to serve neighbors in love 
and justice (Luke 10:25–28).  The insights and values, patterns and convic-
tions of law and gospel play different roles in illuminating the context, 
issues and challenges posed by genetic knowledge and its applications.
A Social Statement
8
The ELCA also believes that contemporary knowledge and insights can 
help Scripture speak in new and needed ways in today’s context.  They can 
help Christians interpret the Bible faithfully for both individual and corpo-
rate understanding.
The ELCA holds that Christian discernment and participation in public 
discussions concerning genetic knowledge and its potential benefits and 
harms will be inaccurate if we do not learn from the research of educa-
tional institutions and scientific enterprise or from the practice of medicine. 
 
It will be incomplete if we do not engage business and commerce as well 
as social activists and those who care for the earth.  On the other hand, the 
meaning of genetic knowledge and the debates about its use will be inad-
equately explored and morally dangerous without attention to the wisdom 
of faith traditions.6 
To dialogues regarding genetic knowledge and its applications, this 
church brings the witness of Scripture, the knowledge of its members in 
their secular or “everyday” callings and Christian thought about the charac-
ter of life and the good of society.
3.2 God: Creator of  the community of  life
Scripture and the Lutheran Confessions profess God the Creator 
who originates, preserves and will bring to completion the whole creation. 
Luther’s Small Catechism teaches about the ultimate dependence of the uni-
verse upon God’s creative activity in a simple yet profound way:  “I believe 
that God has created me together with all that exists.  God has given me 
and still preserves my body and soul….And all this is done out of pure, 
fatherly, and divine goodness and mercy….”7
This divine parental-like action is not confined to a series of events in 
the past. God creates continually,8 orchestrating an interplay between the 
laws of nature and contingent events to create and sustain all that exists.  
Christians profess the Spirit of God, who moved over the waters at Cre-
ation (Genesis 1:2), as the creative wellspring of all life (Psalm 104:1–35).  
They understand the Word as the ordering principle of all that was, is and 
will be (John 1:1–18). 
God’s creative action brings forth a dynamic, varied, evolving, interde-
pendent community of abundance and life. In this creation, each participant 
has a relationship to God and has a God-given integrity and value. 
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
9
Genesis 1:1–3:24 illuminates these insights.9  God transforms the barren 
emptiness of the void into an environment of abundance that can sustain an 
elaborate, complex web of life.  In so doing, God establishes a divine rela-
tionship of trusting community that constitutes a God-given goodness and 
dignity for the whole creation.  Shaped by the gifts that God gives, there is 
both delight in and a task for each aspect of the creation.
Genesis portrays God creating the sun and moon with the task to rule (reg-
ulate and order) day and night.  As with the seas, God commands the earth to 
bring forth and sustain living beings—wild and domestic animals, reptiles and 
other creatures that creep (Genesis 1:24–25).  Each species of bird, mammal, 
reptile and insect has its own fertility and kind, ever dependent upon the land.  
All members of the community of life have the task to be fruitful, to multiply 
and to fill the earth.  Because each participant of creation depends ultimately 
upon God and is tasked by God, they are not simply resources for human well-
being or parts of a greater good; they are good in themselves.
As God transforms the earth from barrenness toward abundance, God 
chooses to make human creatures. These human creatures share some tasks 
of the sun and the moon (to regulate and order the earth) and some tasks of 
the earth and its creatures (to be fruitful, multiply and fill the earth).
God creates human beings as interdependent with the whole creation and 
as responsible to provide oversight as stewards who care for that creation.  It 
is a vocation, a calling to continue what God is already doing for the earth—a 
calling to respect and promote the creation’s flourishing.  In this sense, Gen-
esis understands the human species as being created “in the image of God” 
(Genesis 1:26–28).
In Genesis 2:18–20, God brings every living creature to ADAM10 and 
watches to see what they are named.  The text illustrates that human beings 
should be innovative and inventive as they help order, tend and shape nature 
so that barrenness might abate and abundance reign.  Human beings are to be 
innovative stewards of creation.
This vocation within God’s creation means humans should not claim 
for themselves authority to make decisions based solely on human interests.  
They should consider both the integrity of the other participants in the com-
munity of life and their tasks before God.  The human vocation as innova-
tive stewards must be guided by the goal to respect and promote the earth’s 
abundance for the sake of the community of life.
A Social Statement
10
As one expression of human stewardship, this church affirms science 
and technology as appropriate means to order and imagine, nurture and in-
vent.  In this sense the ELCA rejoices in genetic knowledge and its applica-
tion as an intellectual and social good.
3.3 Sin: pride and complacency
Genesis 1 narrates God’s acts of creation from the perspective of 
God’s powerful relation to all nature.  The second narrative of origins 
(Genesis 2:4b–25) portrays the creation story primarily from the perspective 
of God’s relation to human beings, where the alienation of sin soon enters 
the picture.  It portrays the failure of human beings to live out their human 
vocation under God; it presents sin as disobedience rooted in lack of trust 
and faith in God.11
Genesis 3:1ff. depicts human beings as attempting to usurp the place 
of God. The human creatures, against the Creator’s directive and without 
seeking God’s consent, eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good 
and evil.  Sin manifests here as excessive pride or self-assertion arising from 
misplaced trust in human knowledge, will and ability.  This pride leads to 
the misuse of human power.
The multiple consequences of human disobedience are cataclysmic.  
Rather than receiving divine knowledge of good and evil, human beings 
practice dishonesty in self-deception and self-justification.
The cataclysm negatively affects the earth’s thriving.  The earth is 
depicted as having difficulty bringing forth plants, fruits and grain.  Suffer-
ing, sweat and sorrow become part of the creation’s broken situation.  All 
creatures, including human ones, will return to dust (3:19).
The subsequent narratives in the book of Genesis depict this ongoing 
cataclysm as a pattern of broken relationships with God, within and between 
individuals, and in social organizations and structural arrangements.  They 
demonstrate that sin’s impact—serious enough on the level of the individu-
al—can be magnified in collective beliefs systems, structures and institutions. 
Genetic science and the delivery of its technology necessarily have a 
collective character.  Like some other forms of technology, they require 
huge, continuous investments of human and financial resources.  The po-
tential for misuse of power has always been present in regard to any human 
technology.  When human beings, however, gain significant power over the 
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
11
genome in global contexts, misuse carries qualitatively new dangers.  Ex-
cessive pride can be especially tempting because genetic knowledge allows 
humans to push against previous constraints into ethically uncharted areas.
Along with sin as excessive pride, Scripture also teaches that sin can be 
manifested as negligence or complacency, a lack of trust in God that de-
spairs in human failures and limitations and neglects responsibility for love 
and action (Matthew 25:14–30).  This manifestation of sin can translate into 
resignation and fatalism.
Resignation can occur because genetic science, technology and com-
merce seem overwhelmingly complex and forbidding.  It can follow and 
feed upon discouragement when individuals and systems are focused on 
self-interest and where commitment to care of the earth is tepid.  Far too 
many become complacent or neglect their responsibility for the positive 
and constructive use of human powers.  Far too many assume the role of 
a powerless bystander who believes little or nothing can be done to change 
the course of events.
This church recognizes that both manifestations of sin—excessive 
pride and complacency or negligence—can appear as humans seek genetic 
knowledge and use its potential.  It believes both manifestations must be 
confronted.
The ELCA also raises a warning against genetic determinism and the 
association of the genetic code with original sin.  Genetic determinism 
can appear in everyday beliefs or in various kinds of scientific research.12  
Genetic determinists may claim that gene expression is the explanation for 
original sin or the source of an inborn propensity to do evil.
Scientific disciplines contribute to human knowledge about the sources 
and dynamics of human behavior, but their investigations cannot exhaus-
tively explain the Christian understanding of original sin as alienation from 
God.  Regardless of the level of genetic influence on human behavior, the 
human race remains morally responsible, and all people stand in need of 
God’s grace for redemption.13 
3.4 Redemption, hope and responsibility
Christians find redemption in God’s self-revelation in Jesus Christ, cruci-
fied and raised from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1–24).  This revelation also 
orients Christian engagement with genetic knowledge and its application.
A Social Statement
12
The Word became flesh, took on a human genome,14 and lived among 
the abundance and sorrow of the earth and human culture, as evident in 
Jesus’ ministry of proclamation, healing and teaching.  On the cross, God 
shows complete solidarity with creation, encompassing even its suffering 
and death, failures and sin (Psalm 22:1, Psalm 130:1).  God turns the groans 
of creation (Romans 8:18–25) into a prayer out of the depths, taking hu-
man sorrow and sin into the divine life.
The horror of the Son of God hanging on a cross discloses the terrible 
consequences of sin that pervert even good intentions and structures.  The 
cross stands in judgment of all human endeavors, intentions, social struc-
tures and technologies.
But sin and death do not prevail.  The resurrection of Christ mani-
fested God’s power to create something out of nothing—to create life anew 
out of the negation of abandonment and death.  In raising Jesus from the 
dead, God promises a future of restoration and abundance for the whole 
creation (Isaiah 25:6–9; 65:17; 66:22; Revelation 21:1–4).  In this promised 
future, everything will be brought to judgment and redemption, including 
genetic knowledge and the uses humans make of it.
In baptism, Christians die to their sinful condition and take on the iden-
tity of Christ (Romans 5:12–21; 1 Corinthians 15:49; Colossians 1:15–16).  
They are baptized into Jesus’ death and resurrection.  Through the gift of 
faith, they receive God’s power to live Jesus’ way of service and care for 
others.
In the pattern of Christ, Christians receive a baptismal vocation15 to 
participate in God’s ongoing work of sustaining and promoting life.  They 
live this vocation out in everyday callings, such as those of citizens, parents 
or caregivers, and in daily work such as that of scientists, medical providers 
or farmers.  They find their overarching orientation in the vision and values 
of God’s promised future for all creation.  Their faith becomes ever active 
in love seeking justice.
The gift of faith does not end the reality of sin or overcome human 
finitude.  The spiritual and moral ambiguity of life, even Christian life, 
requires commitment to critical engagement16 as one element of the vigilant 
rejection of their sinful condition.  Present realities require difficult and 
complex decisions, often with uncertain and morally dissatisfying outcomes.
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
13
Living in hope of God’s promised fulfillment and yet accountable for 
present actions, Christians are called to discern how God’s gifts of genetic 
knowledge and technology may be wisely evaluated and responsibly used to 
serve the good of all.  As a community of moral deliberation, this church 
is called to discern an ethical framework to engender moral formation, 
responsible deliberation and action in response to the challenges of unprec-
edented power.
Sharing a framework does not mean Christians will or must always 
agree about God’s will.  Moral consensus and certainty in daily life of-
ten elude the faithful.17  As members of the body of Christ, however, we 
struggle together to “discern what is the will of God—what is good and 
acceptable and perfect” (Romans 12:2).  We are enjoined to abide in com-
munity and in dialogue.
IV. Respect and Promote the Community of Life with Justice and Wisdom
4.1 The imperative
Love of God and others is the guiding norm and imperative of Chris-
tian life.  Following Martin Luther, the ELCA looks to Jesus’ instruction 
about love in the Sermon on the Mount:  “In everything do to others as you 
would have them do to you; for this is the law and the prophets”18 (Mat-
thew 7:12; Luke 6:31).  This biblical imperative demands moral reciprocity 
and mutuality, which people across the world have sensed and observed as a 
universal golden rule.
In the Lutheran tradition, Christians are freed in their baptismal voca-
tion to follow this imperative through service to the neighbor and through 
building up of the common good.  They are freed to reason with all people 
of good will and to seek shared moral understanding.
Following Luther and the Lutheran tradition, this church affirms that 
the meaning and scope of the golden rule are not static.  The nature of 
reciprocity must be constantly reexamined in the light of lived circum-
stances.  Contemporary knowledge and power call for the extension of the 
moral sphere beyond the human good.  Moral standing does not belong to 
humans alone.
As reciprocity between humans does not always mean strict mutual-
ity or equal treatment, so, too, reciprocity between humans and the com-
A Social Statement
14
munity of life requires careful discrimination and judgment.  Reciprocity 
must always mean that the community of life, its members and individuals, 
has moral standing that needs to be taken into account in discernment and 
deliberation for action.
Accordingly, responsible people are called to practice the imperative 
of love for all that God has made, which today can be stated as:  Respect and 
promote the community of  life with justice and wisdom.
This ethical imperative19 provides a central value, basic directives and 
supporting principles as the means to evaluate policy and action.  With this 
imperative, the ELCA articulates an ethic of universal human obligation to 
serve the flourishing of the created order.
4.2 Seek the good of  the community of  life
God’s love, expressed in creation, redemption and promised fulfillment, 
nurtures and tends the community of life (Isaiah 43:16–21; 2 Corinthians 
5:11–21).  As God loves the world, so also humans should love the world.  
In imitation of God’s love, the good of the community of life is the highest 
value, which human decisions, actions and relations should seek to respect 
and promote.  For Lutheran Christians, seeking this good in all actions 
related to genetic science can be understood as an expression of our baptis-
mal vocation to participate in God’s ongoing work.
Western political thought has long centered on the common good of 
human society as the primary value for government and citizen action. 
Christian thought has shared this commitment, a commitment implied in 
the commands to love and do justice (Amos 5:24; Galatians 6:9–10).
Today, the meaning of “common good” or “good of all” must include the 
community of all living creatures.  The meaning also should extend beyond the 
present to include consideration for the future of the web of life.  The sphere 
of moral consideration is no longer limited to human beings alone.20 
The genetic sciences, as they investigate the structure and function 
of genes and chromosomes, teach anew about the integrity and intercon-
nectedness of all life.  All living beings exist because of common biologi-
cal structures and processes, and all share fundamental dependencies and 
interdependencies.  All life forms are related one to another.
New and growing knowledge about the fundamental genetic intercon-
nectedness and basis of life reaffirms the insights of Genesis about the 
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
15
continuity of the human species with the rest of God’s creation.  Scripture and 
science bid all people of good will to consider and positively respond to the 
moral implications of human participation in the intricate web of life.
This participation and interconnectedness reveal that living beings 
and their future generations have a stake in human choices because their 
prospects, in some measure, will depend directly upon human actions taken 
today.  In turn, the goods of human life (physical, psychological, reflec-
tive, social and spiritual) rest in significant measure upon the health of the 
ecosystem.  The flourishing of our grandchildren’s grandchildren depends 
on the health of this web of life, as well.
The good of the community of life should now serve as the overarch-
ing value to guide moral reflection and action.  This church maintains that 
genetic knowledge and its possible application will most often be, and must 
always seek to be, of benefit to the community of life.  It contends this 
value should rule against the use of genetic science that significantly injures 
the health of the community of life.
The pursuit of genetic knowledge and its applications will rightfully give 
priority to serving the needs of existing individuals and the human community, 
with particular attention to the needs of the most vulnerable.  These efforts, 
however, must not compromise the integrity of future human generations and 
should consider the integrity of the rest of the biosphere—animals, plants, soils 
and the ecosystem as a whole, including the water and air on which it depends.
The goal and scope of the common good includes the health of the 
community of life, today and tomorrow.  To value properly this commu-
nity, Christians and people of good will are called to take up dual roles.  
As members of the community of life, we must cultivate and act out of 
respect for the rest of the community.  Aware of our connection to other 
living creatures, we also must assume new responsibilities for creatively 
intervening as stewards of the good creation.
4.3 Respect
Respect is a directive grounded in the dignity and integrity of created 
life (Exodus 20:11–17).  For Lutheran Christians, respect follows from 
God’s regard for all life as precious, from the amoeba to the person.  Hu-
man beings cannot love as God loves, but the minimal response of innova-
tive stewards to other members of the community of life is to recognize 
their givenness21 and to perceive their inherent or intrinsic value.
A Social Statement
16
The fact that creatures across the multitude of forms exhibit both pur-
posiveness22 and interdependence establishes the grounds for respect.  The 
community of life is sustained by individual activity and mutual interdepen-
dence as all creatures function together within a complex whole.
Respect constitutes a moral baseline that places limits on all relation-
ships, decisions and actions.  The placement of the directive to respect 
before the directive to promote indicates a priority for claims of integrity 
and dignity for members of the web of life.
This priority is consistent with the Lutheran understanding of the use 
of the law to protect from harm and restrain evil.23  It expresses the bibli-
cal recognition of the power of sin and self-deception evident even in the 
desire to seek the good (Romans 7:14–23).
While respect means Christians should practice regard for others in all 
their relations and actions, it does not mean that the interests of life forms 
do not conflict.  Everywhere on earth, life feeds on life.  It does not mean 
Christians can or must show equal regard for the amoeba and the person.  
When the interests of life forms conflict, Christians must discern morally 
relevant differences and seek to resolve these dilemmas in ways that respect 
all.
Christian faith views all life as precious and given, such that respect and 
gratitude must govern even the sacrifice of life in which humans are inevita-
bly involved, such as eating or aspects of scientific research.  The fecundity 
of the web of life calls forth awe and wonder as well as loss and mourning.  
Respect for life engenders both responses.
Respect requires significant constraints upon human action toward 
other human beings, even for the sake of helping or benefiting them.  For 
example, in the context of medical care, people are entitled, as an expres-
sion of their dignity, to informed consent that limits or constrains what 
medical staff properly can do.
In the domains of genetic research and application, whether upon 
plants, animals or humans, respect must continually guide and sometimes 
control human action.  This is true even with actions that seek to enhance 
or improve the community of life.  Given the complexity of the communi-
ty, with the interwoven and sometimes conflicting interests of its members, 
discerning what it means to respect life can be difficult.
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
17
Conflicting interests cannot always be reconciled.  The dignity of all 
life, however, calls for discernment of appropriate expressions of regard 
for others, which will vary across forms of life.  For example, genetic re-
search on competent human subjects should never be undertaken without 
informed consent.  For non-competent human subjects, respect requires 
more than surrogate informed consent, and it may allow research only un-
der conditions that limit risk and maximize benefit.
Genetic research on animals, such as mice, may require the death of 
individual experimental subjects.  The directive of respect, however, rules 
out frivolous or abusive treatment.
Genetic research on plants and animals should consider also what it 
means to respect a species in relation to the health and integrity of the 
biotic community.  Species come into existence, change continually, and 
sometimes go extinct due to natural and human causes.  The flourishing 
of life, however, depends upon complex capacities to deal with stress, to 
reproduce and to maintain optimum operations such as biodiversity.  When 
genetic science and technology intervene into the integrity of a plant or 
animal species, the wider web of life must be respected and regarded as 
morally relevant.24
Members of this church will not always agree about what it means to 
respect an individual life form, a species or the biotic community.  An ethic 
of responsibility requires this church to be in dialogue about how the direc-
tive of respect governs the many different domains of genetic science and 
its applications.
While the discernment of respectful action can sometimes be difficult 
and elusive, respect plays a vital protective role.  This role is critical in social 
contexts marked by an aggressive resistance to human suffering and death.  
It is critical in a century of burgeoning powers where the integrity of life 
can be compromised by the desire to make the world a better place.  Re-
spect challenges the temptation to achieve all the perceived “good” possible 
regardless of means.
This church believes all technologies deserve moral scrutiny because 
they bear on individual and corporate practices and the matter of respect 
for others.  It rejects ideological positions that portray scientific break-
throughs and new technologies as inherently valuable, progressive, inevi-
table and irreversible.25
A Social Statement
18
This church also rejects the tendency to cede moral deliberation to 
those whose primary interest is determining what kinds and levels of tech-
nology economic markets will bear.  Self-interested pursuits in an economic 
marketplace cannot serve as a substitute for direct and explicit respect for 
the needs of participants in the community of life.
As respect governs human relationships within the community of life 
today, it must also guide actions toward future members.  For example, 
human reproductive cloning might be possible given the development of 
mammalian cloning (1996).  As a matter of respect, however, the ELCA af-
firms the widely held rejection of research into human reproductive cloning 
because of the unacceptable risk of harm to experimental subjects.
This church will continue to reject human reproductive cloning as a 
matter of respect even if it becomes safe and economically feasible.  A per-
son should not be treated as a means to another person’s end.  Cloning for 
the sake of repeating another individual’s genotype violates this standard.  
Aims other than the replication of identity may be possible, but they are 
not compelling today.
If individuals are cloned despite societal and ELCA rejection, this 
church will respect their God-given dignity and will welcome them to the 
baptismal font, like any other child of God.
4.4 Promote
Promote is the other essential directive of the human vocation to be 
innovative stewards.  This directive is grounded in the character of God’s 
creative action, expressed in both the dynamic character of nature and the 
multiple gifts bestowed upon the human species.  Human beings cannot 
create as God does, but they are to be imaginative, inventive and respon-
sible caretakers (Psalm 115:16).
The minimal response to being a human part of the web of life is 
to:  (1) use our capacities for imagination and innovation to promote the 
well-being of the community and (2) resist the temptations to negligence 
or complacency.  Christians find their motivation to benefit others in Jesus’ 
example.  In him God’s love confronted and lessened or cured the ailments 
and misfortunes of those around him (Luke 10: 26-37).
Within the limits of respect, the golden rule today bids humans to 
promote the benefit and betterment of the community of life through 
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
19
creative intervention into its givenness.  Genetic knowledge and technology 
offer stunning means to advance such efforts.  The directive to promote 
the community of life today can include the enhancement of life processes 
and traits that are passed to future generations, such as developing domestic 
seeds or animals with improved nutritional qualities.
God’s intention for the fulfillment of creation will not be realized by 
human efforts to intervene in its processes, and God’s redemption will not 
come through genetics.  Human efforts to promote the flourishing of the 
community of life through genetic innovation, however, can contribute 
to the good of the whole community.  Such efforts also can be reminders, 
albeit fragmentary ones, of creativity and goodness that witness in history 
to the ultimate victory of God that is to come.
The priority of respect over that of promotion means that not every 
possible enhancement or innovation should be pursued.  Promotion must 
not violate the fundamental directive of respect.  Efforts toward enhance-
ment or innovation must be evaluated also through the norms of justice 
and wisdom.  This church rejects striving after some imagined perfection or 
idealized state of human life.
Qualified by these limits, the ELCA encourages human imagination and 
innovation in the use of genetic knowledge to address physical and mental 
conditions, relieve human suffering and improve the human situation.  It 
supports efforts to benefit general well-being within the rest of nature and 
the use of creative means to restore the environment that humans have 
destroyed or damaged.  It supports investment in such goals.26
4.5 Justice
Christians join with others who serve the call to “let justice roll down 
like waters, and righteousness like an everflowing stream” (Amos 5:24).  It 
is clear that justice is God’s intention for all relationships and that it means 
“honoring the integrity of creation, and striving for fairness within the hu-
man family.”27
Urged on by that vision, this church teaches that God holds govern-
ments accountable to ensure justice.  It also holds that every organization, 
business, profession and citizen has the common responsibility to pursue 
just arrangements in the exercise of social power and the making of eco-
nomic decisions.
A Social Statement
20
The uses of genetic knowledge occur within a network of relationships. 
 
Such uses depend upon social and natural resources, and rightfully are sub-
ject to concerns about a just society and care of the earth.
Previous ELCA social statements have identified four guiding prin-
ciples that spell out the meaning of justice relevant to the study of genetics 
and its use:  sufficiency, sustainability, solidarity and participation.28  These 
principles articulate essential criteria for discernment and deliberation in the 
quest to use genetic knowledge for good while avoiding harm.
These principles, taken together, attend to the temporality and inter-
dependence of the community of life and are critically necessary to guide 
moral decision-making in this century.  The principle of sufficiency guides 
decisions in the present while sustainability protects the future.  Together 
they express moral concern for consequences across time.
The principle of solidarity entails compassion and accountability for 
the interdependence of life.  The principle of participation insists all liv-
ing things be considered in calculations about the good of the community 
of life. 
Sufficiency
The principle of sufficiency obligates human beings to care for the ba-
sic needs of others and all other life forms.  It is grounded in the belief that 
God provides abundance that is sufficient for all.  The ELCA has taken the 
position that economic activities must be evaluated in terms of how they 
“enable people to meet their basic needs, including nutrition…health care, 
personal development, and participation in community with dignity.”29 
Genetic science and technology require an immense investment of hu-
man and economic resources. Accordingly, economic activity resulting from 
genetic knowledge and application should explicitly align with serving the 
basic needs of human beings and the natural environment.
Since agricultural biotechnology and many aspects of medical genetics 
directly concern the basic needs of human life, sufficiency reinforces the 
ELCA’s position that decisions about these goods cannot simply be left to 
the mechanisms of the market.30  This church defines the public good in 
terms of sufficiency and contends that genetic research, medicine, com-
merce and biotechnology should advance the common good rather than the 
economic gain of some.
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
21
The ELCA has called for scrutiny concerning “how specific policies 
and practices affect people and nations that are the poorest.”31   Such scru-
tiny involves, for instance, assessing whether corporate ownership of seed 
patents increases the availability and equitable distribution of food for peo-
ple who are hungry in the short-term while increasing the ability of people 
to feed themselves in the long-term.  This church encourages governments, 
universities, nongovernmental organizations and private companies to seek 
ways to contribute to meeting basic needs and to broaden access for all who 
might benefit from genetic applications.
Sustainability32  
ELCA statements have described the principle of sustainability as 
“providing an acceptable quality of life for present generations without 
compromising that of future generations.”33   In the past, Christians have 
supported this principle by appeal to the sabbath and jubilee laws (Leviti-
cus 25:1ff.).  Today, responsible people must embrace a larger scope of 
accountability to future generations because of increases in both human 
power and population. 
The ELCA has affirmed research and application that protects and 
promotes the capacity of natural and social systems to survive and thrive 
together over the long-term.  It also has encouraged respect for reasonable 
environmental limits.34
This church has long supported judicious government regulation to 
protect the needs and rights of individuals and communities and to pro-
mote the common good.35  It has considered social, economic and environ-
mental impacts to be legitimate criteria for consideration when developing 
national regulatory and product approval processes.  It affirms the work 
of regulatory science, risk assessment and risk management and impact 
assessment.  Such work should be aimed at fostering policies and practices 
consistent with long-term sustainability.
This church, however, believes overly restrictive regulation must not 
be a default response to novel genetic technology.  Regulation must be 
justified by specified concerns for the potential harm of a genetic appli-
cation and its delivery or by the necessity to regulate toward equal access 
and use.
In regulating new products and processes, government regulators and 
policy makers have historically relied on three standard criteria:  (1) human 
A Social Statement
22
risk and safety, (2) immediate animal and environmental risk and safety, and 
(3) technological efficacy.  The ELCA affirms these criteria and urges their 
continued, consistent and reasonable application.
In the assessment of genetic processes and products, however, the 
ELCA calls for the implementation of an additional criterion:  long-term eco-
logical, social and economic impact.36  The implementation of this criterion would 
introduce novel features into the current regulatory process and could slow 
development.  Its inclusion in models of risk assessment and regulation, 
therefore, must be judicious.  Its inclusion, though, is vital because the ap-
plication of genetic knowledge may have extraordinary impact on the bio-
sphere and future generations.  Its inclusion can help guard against extraor-
dinary unanticipated and unintended consequences on species (including on 
the human species).
This church recognizes that development of protocols for assessing 
long-term ecological, social and economic impact requires creating new 
and effective models to implement such assessment.  It will be a notable 
challenge to develop these models in the face of conflicting interests.  The 
ELCA calls upon its laity with appropriate expertise to be involved in such 
efforts as a part of their callings.
Solidarity
Solidarity recognizes a kinship within all of nature that issues from 
God’s creative activity (Psalms 104 and 148).  It recognizes the fundamental 
human continuity and interdependence with all living things and natural 
resources on the earth.  It expresses the contention that the interests of the 
entire community of life should be legitimate concerns when decisions are 
made and actions evaluated.
The principle of solidarity grounds the moral duty of human beings to 
stand together in interdependence to act locally and globally on behalf of 
individuals and cultures.37  It provides a check on the tendency of human 
endeavor to benefit primarily those who hold power or privilege at the 
expense of those who have little or no power.
This principle raises the question of benefit.  It asks how research pri-
orities are decided and registers concern about where time, dollars and ex-
pertise are invested.  It calls for weighing the needs and desires of relatively 
affluent populations over against the most pressing needs in resource-poor 
nations. It affirms a commitment to taking into account the needs of those 
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
23
who are marginalized by socio-economic class, limited political power, race, 
gender, sexual orientation and various disabilities.
Solidarity encourages the search for ways to direct genetic research with 
an eye toward whether or not the procedures and technologies will become 
widely available.  Solidarity stresses that those who set research priorities 
should keep these concerns in view, especially when research focuses on 
diseases or situations that affect relatively few numbers of people or when 
they address problems found especially among the more affluent.
This principle also bears on the way research is done. For instance, 
public and private sector research organizations have different institutional 
incentives and produce different types of knowledge and technology.  His-
torically speaking: 
• 
universities conduct research directed at the creation of public 
goods;
• 
industry conducts research directed at the creation of proprietary 
goods; and
• 
government provides funding for research and regulation for fair 
competition and public safety.
This arrangement has delivered products enhancing social welfare.  
Short-term gain or greed and bias, however, can cloud long-term vision.  This 
problem can be especially acute when profitability is the determining factor.  
Scientists in a private research organization may have different motivations 
and goals from those in public research organizations.  These differences can 
be especially significant with regard to what illnesses are researched, therapies 
developed, seeds marketed and the kinds of animals cloned.
A balance of proprietary and public goods is necessary to enhance 
social welfare.  It is important, then, that the society of the United States 
maintain robust public funding for genetic research and development.  
From the vantage point of solidarity, it is a worrisome trend when universi-
ties limit or withhold public access to their work for proprietary reasons 
such as patent rights and increased revenue streams.38
The ELCA encourages the establishment of policies ensuring that in-
tellectual property protections do not limit research or the development of 
new discoveries that might contribute to the social welfare.  In its advocacy 
work, this church must raise questions about whether for-profit genetic 
A Social Statement
24
science and technology serve the common good and whether states and na-
tions allocate sufficient public funding to meet the obligations of justice.
The ELCA calls upon those in government and commerce to give 
emphasis to seeking the means to direct equitably the benefits of genetic 
knowledge and application.  It urges attention to achieving access for all 
members of the human family regardless of which segments of society a 
person can be identified with.
Participation
The principle of participation recognizes that God’s creative activity 
invites the involvement of all creatures in the continuation and flourishing 
of the community of life.  It calls for human action to do the same.  This 
principle grounds the idea that human beings “are to participate actively in 
decisions that impact [their] lives.”39  This church maintains that marginal-
ized voices must be given particular opportunities for participation.
Participation guides the ELCA insofar as it seeks to be a community 
of moral deliberation.  It also authorizes this church’s advocacy—speaking 
alongside and for those who are marginalized.  Advocacy occurs as mem-
bers speak out individually or as part of activist groups.  It also includes 
the public witness coordinated by the advocacy offices of the ELCA or of 
Lutheran partner nongovernmental organizations.
As a principle of justice in the contemporary context, participation re-
quires that all living things be respected as “entitled to be heard and to have 
their interests considered when decisions are made” or when actions or 
policies are evaluated.  Human deliberation should “hear” the needs of all 
living things—present and future—with special regard given to the voices 
of those who work closest to the land and with living creatures.40
The principle of participation supports this church’s conviction that 
genetic research and its application require public accountability.  Such ac-
countability is especially relevant when novel products and procedures are 
being developed.
In those cases, the ELCA encourages that requisite time be taken for 
research, education and monitoring that allow large portions of the public 
to understand the issues and their ramifications.  If the interests of margin-
alized people are at stake, it is necessary that means be found to offer these 
individuals and groups the practical means to register their concerns.
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
25
This church encourages its members and all people of good will to 
be aware of, seek sound knowledge of and actively participate in debates 
concerning public policies related to the application of genetic knowledge.  
It calls upon government and businesses to ensure that procedures and suf-
ficient time provide the means for broad participation.
4.6 Wisdom
In a century of growing genetic knowledge and practical power, the 
golden rule demands wise use of that knowledge and power.  Wise use 
requires expert knowledge as well as humility and caution in the face of 
conflicting demands and uncertainty.
Knowledge of experts
The ELCA believes all people must seek and use the best knowledge 
available in making decisions and developing practices or protocols.  New 
scientific discoveries and technologies often raise moral questions that can-
not be addressed without complex knowledge.  In these situations, good 
character and “common sense” alone may not provide sufficient informa-
tion or insight to determine the most adequate course.  This requires seek-
ing out the knowledge and insight of specialists and experts. It also requires 
learning how to critically assess and employ their input.
Knowledge matters to moral insight.  Those who possess special or 
expert knowledge relevant to decision-making have a moral duty to share 
what they know with those engaged in the process of moral discernment 
and policy adoption.
At the same time the specialist has a responsibility to exercise humility 
about the range and durability of what specialists believe they know.  Their 
responsibility also includes enabling the participation of others in the pro-
cess of moral discernment and policy adoption.
Humility
Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition have encouraged the cultiva-
tion of humility to restrain sinful thought and action.  The moral ambiguity 
of modern science and technology points to the continuing importance 
of this virtue.  The unknowns, the conflicts and other challenges of moral 
discernment about genetics, even with the benefit of the best knowledge 
and sound principles, warrant the continued cultivation of personal and 
communal humility.
A Social Statement
26
In the case of genetic research and application, well-intentioned people 
can disagree over matters of knowledge and ways to respond to the state of 
knowledge.  Discernment may be further complicated by the question of 
what criteria should be given priority when evaluating promise or harm.  In 
some cases, the principles of sufficiency, sustainability, solidarity and partici-
pation will be in conflict.
Reasonable people, for instance, may observe that an existing technology 
with known risks will adequately solve a problem in question and that a ge-
netic technology is not necessary.  Others may claim that present technology 
is insufficient to solve the problems or will create unacceptable consequences 
in the long run.  Such differences in judgment may stem from questions of 
knowledge, and parties to these disagreements will bring different forms of 
knowledge, each of which may be needed for adequate deliberation.
 
In the face of differing analysis, conflicting principles and contrast-
ing knowledge claims, wise moral reasoning invokes the virtue of humility.  
It practices this virtue in listening to others with good will and in remaining 
open as others express their positions and interests.
Precautionary principle
The importance of humility in the face of uncertain knowledge leads 
to a principle of wisdom:  the precautionary principle.  The ELCA under-
stands this principle to mean “When human activities may lead to morally 
unacceptable harm that is scientifically plausible but uncertain, action shall 
be taken to avoid or diminish that harm.”41 
This principle covers only a limited class of risk-taking actions—but an 
exceedingly important one.42  In response to certain conditions, this prin-
ciple embodies caution grounded in respect for the community of life.  It 
does not apply where standard risk-benefit analysis can be used and present 
or future outcomes can be predicted and evaluated reliably.
Precaution comes into play when existing tools for risk assessment 
are overwhelmed by a high level of uncertainty and proposed actions may 
dramatically affect the integrity and limits of the earth or the existence of 
future generations.  In such cases, the burden to demonstrate safety rests 
upon those who promote the novel action.
Given the directive to promote the community of life, precaution does 
not intend to stifle exploration, innovation or new technology.  This church 
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
27
encourages these but calls for wise care and restraint in response to extraor-
dinary uncertainty, speed and potential harm due to technological innova-
tion.  As common human wisdom maintains, responsible people should, 
above all, do no harm in seeking to benefit others.
4.7 General convictions
The imperative to respect and promote the community of life with 
justice and wisdom provides a general orientation for the human vocation 
today.  As a framework for faith active in love of others, it provides for 
respectful deliberation, creative choices, sound advocacy, wise practices 
and life-giving decisions over the long run.  This framework leads this 
church to state some general convictions that can guide particular judg-
ments about the use of genetic technology and contribute to the common 
good of all.
The ELCA calls upon individuals, agencies, organizations, corporations 
and governments to pursue goals, set policies or establish practices that: 
• 
advocate for genetic research and discovery that advance the good 
of the present generation and those to come;
• 
affirm the good of genetic technologies and economic enterprises 
that enable the community of life to flourish;
• 
encourage varieties of research aimed at improving human health 
and well-being;
• 
give priority to global health issues and needs, particularly those 
which may benefit by genetic research, even when the economic 
return is small;
• 
maximize the use of medical genetic information to improve care 
without succumbing to discrimination or the abuse of privacy;
• 
affirm quality of human life improvement with reasonable life 
extension without expecting or seeking perfection, insofar as such 
research does not lead to unjust and disproportionately biased use 
of limited human and financial resources;
• 
encourage the development of genetic means to aid reversal of 
past human abuse of the environment without harming the future;
• 
promote greater dialogue, understanding and cooperation among 
organic and conventional farmers to solve production issues and 
lessen tensions;
A Social Statement
28
• 
implement long-term ecological, social and economic impact as-
sessment in regulatory protocols around genetic research; and
• 
encourage the development of means to enable marginalized 
voices to be heard in public policy debates.
Likewise, this church rejects beliefs, goals and policies that:
• 
rely upon or encourage fatalism and genetic determinism;
• 
use genetic knowledge or technology to create unsustainable practices 
or supposed states of perfection;
• 
use genetic information for discrimination in employment, health care 
or insurance coverage; 
• 
use personal genetic information without consent;
• 
expand genetic research or technology that endangers human bodies 
for the sake of economic gain or social power, which is a particular 
danger for marginalized racial and ethnic communities; and
• 
practice institutional or ideological human eugenic programs. 
Likewise, the ELCA will raise searching questions about goals and policies that:
• 
expand genetic research or technology while knowingly and unduly 
endangering plant and animal species, microflora or fauna or the exis-
tence of biodiversity;
• 
impact negatively on individual and community livelihoods and impede 
or harm cooperation and respect among affected people and commu-
nities; and
• 
direct genetic knowledge and technology in ways that further inequali-
ties or benefit the interests of the few at the expense of the many.
As a community in Christ engaged in moral discernment regarding is-
sues of research priorities and the just delivery of the products of research, 
and as a participant in public dialogue regarding genetic knowledge and its 
uses, this church will consistently articulate, argue for and apply such con-
victions as expressions of an ethics of reciprocity and responsibility.

V. Challenges and Commitments for Christian Community 
 
5.1 Changing contexts
In much wisdom is both vexation and satisfaction, and those who in-
crease knowledge increase both sorrow and possibility (Ecclesiastes 1:12–
18).  The ELCA recognizes that the 21st century seems certain to bring a 
tremendous increase in what rightly may be called ambiguous promise.
Opportunities afforded by the advance of genetics have brought or hold 
promise for new and exciting solutions to old problems.  They also will bring 
greater complexity and ambiguity into the decisions that have to be made in the 
pastor’s study, doctor’s offices, boardrooms and public policy debates.  Some-
times the answers will seem straightforward to some while not to others, and 
sometimes the personal decisions that must be made will be heart wrenching.  
The cumulative effect will introduce greater diversity into congregational life.
In the midst of ambiguous promise and greater diversity, the ELCA, 
thankfully, can call upon resources of the Christian faith with renewed em-
phasis and can take up long-standing responsibilities shaped in new ways.
5.2 Koinonia
The New Testament Greek word koinonia (coy-no-nee-ah) carries 
multiple and layered meanings evoking “community,” “mutuality,” “fel-
lowship,” “reciprocity,” “holding in common” and “union.”43  The term 
embraces all of these meanings to suggest a spirited commitment to 
bearing one another’s burdens and being one in Christ. The renewal of 
koinonia is vital for Christian identity today.
Koinonia has its origin in the life of the Triune God; it refers to the 
relationship of love and mutuality between the Father, Son and Holy 
Spirit.  God’s love is the basis, model, source and motivation for Chris-
tians dwelling together in this way (John 13:31–35).  As a vital dimension 
of Christian identity, it is a gift of the Holy Spirit. It is also a calling to 
cultivate Christian virtues and practices.
The increasing complexity and diversity of options, decisions and 
points of view represent a key challenge to Christian community in this 
age of genetic knowledge.  Christian community is an identity to be lived 
into, one that offers the basis for listening, speaking and being together as 
Christians.  It is one that embraces the difficulties and joys as well as the 
ambiguities brought about in a time of immense new powers.
A Social Statement
30
As places of koinonia, congregations and other ministry sites today 
are called to live into an identity in which all suffer in common when one 
suffers and all rejoice when one rejoices (1 Corinthians 12:1–26; Romans 
12:15; Philippians 2:1–4).  For instance, the knowledge that there is a genet-
ic source for an ailment or a new genetic intervention for a given diagnosis 
will bring relief and joy for some people.  For others this knowledge or a 
failed human intervention may well bring greater anguish and a sense of 
futility.  Some individuals will be able to take advantage of genetic advances 
and others will not. Some will choose not to do so.  In each case, as com-
munities of Christ, congregations are called to be places of compassion.
Genetic factors play a significant role in chronic physical conditions, 
mental illnesses and cognitive limitations.  Certain genetic mutations 
contribute positively to healing or aging while others are associated with dis-
abilities, chronic medical problems and shortened life spans.
As places of koinonia, this church urges its congregations, campus 
ministries and other ministry sites to welcome all.  This welcome includes 
seeking ways to enable all people both to participate in their ministry and 
mission44 and to receive competent and caring pastoral care appropriate to 
their situation.  This commitment to welcome, to participation and to ap-
propriate pastoral care will be important especially if genetic interventions 
were possible but decisions were made to forego them.
Congregations and other ministry sites also are called to practice koi-
nonia in encouraging respect between brothers or sisters in Christ who dis-
agree sharply (Romans 12:9–21).  It must be recognized that the choices of 
Christian people regarding genetic applications sometimes will disrupt the 
assumption of shared viewpoints and common values within congregations 
and places of ministry.  Respect for others when there are sharp differences 
can be especially challenging.
Christian community today does not mean benign tolerance.  It invites 
common discernment in respectful wrestling with and, sometimes, con-
structive challenge of each other’s beliefs and viewpoints.  In increasingly 
complicated and complex situations, congregations and ministry sites today 
will recognize that the will of God may not be absolutely clear, even while it 
is absolutely clear that the will of God must be sought (Romans 12:1–2).
In these times, congregations and other sites of ministry will need to 
give renewed attention to becoming lively places of common reflection, 
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
31
deliberation and discernment.  Given the highly polarized character of con-
temporary society, they must be, above all, places of constructive and civil 
dialogue.  Christian life together will mean careful discernment about when 
challenge or action is needed and when acceptance or accompaniment is 
called for.
Koinonia is an ancient dimension of life in Christ that has new implica-
tions today.  It calls forth shared practices and discernment, even if con-
clusions are not always shared.  It nurtures members both in sharing joys 
and in coping with suffering and sorrow.  It evokes re-imagining the future 
together when sorrows and anxiety cannot be removed.  It forms lives for 
service and responsible choices in times of amazing possibilities.
5.3 Leadership
The Lutheran tradition has a long history of preparing leaders who are 
learned in the general education of sciences and the humanities.  Leader-
ship in a time when genetic developments promise immense changes and 
challenges makes this education ever more crucial.  In addition to immer-
sion in the humanities, the ELCA urges its leaders and encourages its mem-
bers to seek a working knowledge of the natural world through the physical 
sciences and to seek knowledge of the forces that shape society through the 
social sciences.
In particular, this church urges present and, especially, future rostered 
leaders to gain a basic knowledge of genetics.  In this way, ELCA leadership 
will be better able to aid individuals struggling to make a faithful response 
to the challenges presented by genetic knowledge.  Likewise, they must be 
prepared to bring the wisdom of our faith tradition to those seeking to 
determine just and wise ways of using genetic applications, from debates in 
hospital ethics committees to questions of public policy.
This church encourages teaching theologians, bishops, pastors, chap-
lains and others to reflect anew biblically and theologically about the 
meaning of koinonia and the virtues and practices needed to live into that 
aspect of Christian identity. We affirm theological attention to other themes 
and practices that have been and increasingly will be crucial for preaching, 
teaching and practical ministry, such as baptismal vocation, moral formation 
and community deliberation. In addition, we encourage attention within 
seminary curriculums to pastoral care issues stemming from advances in 
genetic sciences.
A Social Statement
32
The ELCA encourages all rostered leaders to prepare reflectively to 
guide individuals through multiple misunderstandings about the meaning of 
genetic knowledge.  There will be those who mistakenly believe that genes 
alone determine the destiny of humanity and the world and who, accord-
ingly, approach life with a kind of fatalism.  There will be those who, given 
their genetic knowledge, believe that with genetic technologies all things 
are possible.  There also will be those, on the other hand, who mistakenly 
believe that all new technologies are to be feared or avoided.
The ELCA calls upon its pastors and other rostered leaders to minister 
wisely with individuals who are grappling with genetic information that 
increases uncertainties and probabilities in their lives.  It urges pastors and 
other rostered leaders to prepare to deal sensitively with those who experi-
ence the soul-searching anguish that results from genetically related condi-
tions or human interventions that fail.  As brothers and sisters in Christ, we 
also wish to find appropriate ways to rejoice with those for whom knowl-
edge of genetic causes or human intervention bring joy or benefit. 
This church urges pastors, parish nurses and other caregivers to seek 
out professionals, such as medical geneticists and genetic counselors, with 
whom they can work in care teams.  Leaders in conferences, synods or 
other appropriate bodies are encouraged to compile lists of resources for 
their jurisdictions to which pastors and care givers can turn for help.
5.4 Church in society  
 
 
 
 
The ELCA acts in the public sectors of society through its members, 
congregations, synods, social ministry organizations, related institutions and 
churchwide expression.  It commits itself to serve as a church that seeks to 
respect and promote the community of life by advocating for the just and 
wise application of genetic knowledge.  This commitment will be lived out 
in many ways.
The ELCA seeks to contribute its best insights regarding the character of 
life in Christ and the good of society.  It affirms that its members’ baptismal 
vocation includes a strong communal dimension.  It calls upon members and 
especially those who serve in social ministry organizations or advocacy to join 
together with all people of good will to support just and wise laws and poli-
cies that will guide the advance of genetic knowledge and its application.
The ELCA encourages its church-related schools, colleges and uni-
versities to prepare students in the sciences, applied sciences, humanities 
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
33
and business in such a way that they develop both expert knowledge and 
a service-oriented commitment to share what they know for the sake of 
others.  It encourages these institutions to help students explore the con-
nections between these arenas and faith.  It calls upon its youth to consider 
how they might contribute to society’s good by taking up such daily callings 
as medicine, research, commerce, agriculture, advocacy, political leadership, 
ethical reflection and rostered ministry.
The ELCA’s social ministry organizations and agencies are places of 
compassion and service that can practice just and wise use of medical and 
commercial applications.  This church encourages them to strengthen their 
role of sharing their informed perspectives in public debates regarding how 
genetic research and technology may be made available equitably and with 
appropriate access for those in need.
As a church in society, the ELCA recognizes that business decisions 
and public policy issues must be evaluated by key criteria informed by 
sound public reasoning available to all people.  The ELCA proposes for 
public consideration the ethic to respect and promote the community of 
life with justice and wisdom in the pursuit of genetic knowledge and its use. 
 
The ELCA contends that this ethic is essential for the web of life on earth 
to flourish.
In particular this church hopes that this framework will be a starting 
point for conversation about genetics and its use with Lutheran brothers 
and sisters and ecumenical partners around the globe.  It commits itself to 
joining with all others of good will in being directed by this imperative so 
that human beings can maximize the potential good and minimize the dan-
gers of genetic technology for the sake of the blessed creation.
VI. Confidence  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Genetic knowledge and its application introduce into the community 
of life a potentially mixed blessing.  The power now available through ge-
netic science and its various commercial and cultural uses requires diligent 
and sustained attention in order to direct its potential good and to limit its 
potential harm.
This church believes God, who is the beginning and the end of all, calls 
human beings to seek the good of the community of life of which it is a 
A Social Statement
34
part.  Human beings, as innovative stewards, have a distinctive freedom and 
power that are to be used for the sake of that community, but these powers 
are not unlimited, and we are accountable for their use.
Human beings must use these gifts without knowing all possible con-
tingencies or being able to guarantee outcomes.  This church recognizes 
that good and sin, possibility and finitude, hope and anguish are always 
mixed together in earthly life.  Lutheran Christians, nevertheless, claim with 
confidence that we are redeemed decision-makers who have been freed 
to discern and take actions using genetic knowledge in ways that strive to 
respect and promote the flourishing of the web of life.
The ELCA embraces the call to live into koinonia, leadership and public 
involvement in a time of ambiguity, possibility and challenge.  It recognizes 
its role as a public church and prays for God’s guidance even while ac-
knowledging that our best efforts sometimes will be creative and successful 
and sometimes confused or misdirected. 
This church will proceed with due caution to encourage the advance of 
genetic knowledge and technology, advocating for its just and wise use.  It 
calls upon all members of the human community—especially those who ex-
ercise social and economic power—to recognize the weighty choices facing 
the human race with its unprecedented power in this 21st century.  It calls 
for a sober analysis of how power is used in its social context.  It calls upon 
all to recognize the wisdom of emphasizing long-term ecological, social and 
economic needs and giving priority to the common good. 
It must be remembered that not all possibilities are equally acceptable 
and that choosing wisely now is crucial for the integrity of the community 
of life of which human beings are a part, upon which we depend and for 
which we are accountable.  The nature of responsibility in this age of un-
paralleled human power calls for wisdom, humility and courage in delibera-
tion, decision-making and action.
In this 21st century, the church’s trust exists not in human achieve-
ments, but in the Triune God who creates, redeems and will finish making 
all things new.  This One is the source of Christian confidence to live boldly 
in these times; it is a confidence that runs from the beginning to the end of 
faith and responsibility in any age.

the creation and God’s relation to it.  The ﬁ
 rst is found in Genesis 1:1–2:4a 
and the second in Genesis 2:4b–25.
10.  The Hebrew word “ADAM” used in Genesis 2:7–21 means “earth crea-
ture.”
11.  In Luther’s discussion of the First Commandment in the Large Catechism, 
sin is identiﬁ
 ed fundamentally as trust and faith of the heart alone directed to 
false gods.  Paul states,  “for whatever does not proceed from faith is sin” as he 
seeks to persuade his readers that sin, grown from lack of trust in God, leads 
them to cause other believers to stumble, thus destroying the work of God 
(Romans 14:13–23).
12.  Such claims have appeared in the work of some researchers especially, 
for instance, in the disciplines of behavioral genetics, sociobiology and 
evolutionary psychology.
13.  Original sin refers to the human state of alienation from God.  Some 
scientists assume or make express claims regarding genetic determinism.  
Other researchers and critics resist those claims, and the dispute is a lively 
one.  It is possible to recognize the explicit implications of some genetic 
sciences for inherited sin, the behavioral tendencies inﬂ
 uenced by genetic 
code.  The point here, though, is that claims about determinism must be 
resisted and that the understanding of original sin and human redemption 
are not determined by the results of scientiﬁ
 c disputes.  One illustration of 
attention to these matters may be found in Ted Peters, Sin: Radical Evil in 
Soul & Society (Grand Rapids Mich.: Eerdmans, 1994), chapter 10.
14.  To take on human ﬂ
 esh is of necessity to take on a human genome, as

cludes love of God in Mark 12:28–34, Matthew 22:34–40 and Luke 10:25–42. 
 
The double love commandment is formed by a blended and extended combi-
nation of Deuteronomy 6:4–5 and Leviticus 19:17–18.
19.  For reﬂ
 ection on an imperative of this kind see William Schweiker, 
Responsibility and Christian Ethics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,

 cient, Sustainable Lifespan for All: 
Responsible Biotechnology and ELCA Social Thought” in Theological Foun-
dations in an Age of  Biological Intervention, David C. Ratke, ed. (Minneapolis: 
Lutheran University Press, 2008).
20.  The theme of creation-centered stewardship developed in this state-
ment builds upon the direction initiated by the 1993 ELCA social state-
ment Caring for Creation: Vision, Hope, and Justice.  Both reject the view (often 
termed “anthropocentrism”) that the world was made for humans and that 
the rest of creation simply provides resources to serve human well-being.  
Anthropocentrism views non-human features of creation as lacking in 
moral standing.  Drawing upon Scripture and ecological science, both state-
ments understand humans to be essentially related to God’s interdependent 
creation yet unique within it.  Only humans can value other beings and 
systems beyond their own kind for their own sake as created and sustained 
by God.  Since human beings have powers of agency that differentiate them 
from other life forms, they have unique responsibility to support the sus-
tainability of all life on earth.  While some thinkers today argue Christianity 
should adopt an ecocentric ethic that calls for egalitarian relations between 
humanity and otherkind, neither statement takes that approach.
21.  “Givenness” here refers to how others are “given” to us as beings in 
themselves, as they are according to their received nature and agency.  This 
givenness does not mean nature is static or unmalleable but does establish 
that members of nature possess an integrity because of the “way things are.”
22.  It is widely accepted in the philosophy of science that nature does 
not exhibit an inherent teleology or purpose.  Living creatures, however, 
do express purposive effort on their own behalf in the sense of seeking 
nourishment, reacting to their environment and reproducing.  For more on 
how this purposive effort establishes a basis for respect, see Hans Jonas, The 
Imperative of  Responsibility: In Search of  an Ethics for the Technological Age (Chi-
cago: University of Chicago Press, 1985), chapter 3.
23. It also is evident in Luther’s explication of the Commandments in the 
Small Catechism, which presents the negative prohibition of each com-
mandment ﬁ
 rst.  The positive purpose is given second. The Small Cat-
echism, Kolb and Wengert, Book of  Concord, 352–354.
24.  The inclusion of the community of life within the scope and scale of 
Christian love of others has been made for some time now.  See, for example, 
James Nash, Loving Nature: Ecological Integrity and Christian Responsibility (Nash-
ville: Abingdon Press, 1991).  See also references in footnote number 19.

Glossary of Terms 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(This glossary is for the reader’s convenience only; it is not part of the 
adopted social statement.)
Base pairs:  nucleotides on complementary strands of DNA that are spe-
cifically paired with a partner and linked, forming the “rungs of the ladder” 
and giving DNA its double helix structure.  For example, guanine (G) al-
ways pairs with cytosine (C) and thymine (T) always pairs with adenine (A).
Biochemistry:  the scientific study of the chemistry of cells, tissues, organs 
and organisms.
Biodiversity:  the degree of variation of life forms within an ecosystem.
Biosphere:  the sum of all ecosystems; the whole of earth.
Biotechnology:  the use of biological processes of microbes and of plants 
or animal cells for the benefit of humans.  When used in conjunction with 
genetic engineering, it is the genetic modification of an organism’s DNA 
such that the transformed individuals have new traits that enhance survival 
or modify quality.  Modern biotechnology is being used in medicine, fuel 
production, agriculture and food production and criminal science, as well as 
in environmental activities.
Biotic community:  all interacting organisms living together along with the 
soil, water and other features of earth upon which they depend.
Chromosome:  physically separate packages of DNA located in the 
nucleus of a cell.  Different kinds of organisms have different numbers of 
chromosomes.  Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, 46 in all.
Clone:  a group of genetically identical genes, cells or organisms derived 
asexually from a single ancestral cell.
Cloning:  the process of making identical copies of an organism, cell or DNA.
• 
Human reproductive cloning uses genetic material from one person’s 
cells to grow an entire individual human being that has the same 
DNA as the donor
• 
Molecular cloning refers to the process of making multiple copies of a 
defined DNA sequence or fragment of DNA; this is used regularly 
in laboratories for a wide variety of clinical and research efforts.

• 
Reproductive cloning uses genetic material from one organism’s cells to grow 
an entire individual organism that has the same DNA as the donor.
• 
Therapeutic cloning harvests stem cells to study development and treat 
disease; it could also be used to make specific organs or tissues for 
transplant to reduce the risk of organ rejection.
Codon:  sequence of three consecutive nucleotides.
Community of  life:  as used in this document, indicates the web of life of 
all organisms and recognizes their interdependence.
Discernment:  the capacity or process of perceiving and evaluating the 
meaning of many factors in order to make an appropriate response to 
God; often used about theological or moral reflection that involves study, 
prayer and dialogue that leads to a judgment or understanding about a 
particular situation.
DNA:  deoxyribose nucleic acid, the substance of heredity; a large 
molecule that carries genetic information that cells need to replicate and 
to produce proteins.  It is mainly coiled up (as chromosomes) inside the 
control tower of the cell, the nucleus.  DNA is shaped as a twisted ladder, 
called a double helix.
Ecosystem:  a biological environment consisting of all the organisms 
living in a particular area, as well as all the nonliving physical components 
of the environment with which the organisms interact, such as air, soil, 
water, and sunlight.
Embryology:  the branch of biology that studies the formation and early 
development of living organisms.
Eugenics:  literally meaning “good genes,” the term usually indicates simply 
the study of hereditary improvement by genetic control.  It may also refer to 
any intentional strategy to direct the course of the human species through 
encouraging the transmission of “desired” traits while discouraging the “un-
desired” ones.  Such strategies could include selective mating, prenatal testing, 
selective abortion, forced sterilization, ethnic cleansing or others.  However, it 
also may apply to such benign processes as the choosing of a spouse and the 
planning of a pregnancy.

Gene:  the fundamental unit of inheritance; a working subunit of DNA.
Genetic determinism:  the notion that human health and illness, character 
and behavior are shaped by the genes that comprise the individual’s geno-
type rather than also being influenced importantly by culture, environment 
and individual choices.
Genetic engineering:  techniques used to manipulate genetic material 
(genes) of  living cells.  In the United States, under guidelines issued by 
the Department of  Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, genetic engineering is defined as the genetic modification of 
organisms by recombinant technology. Definitions used in Europe tend 
to be broader.
Genetic Profiling:  the use of  genomic information to define a particu-
lar group.
Genetically Modified (GM):  an organism (GMO) produced by genetic 
engineering techniques that allow the transfer of inherited characteris-
tics from one organism to another and occasionally between species (see 
“gene flow” above).  Living modified organisms (LMOs), genetically 
engineered (GE) foods and transgenic crops are other terms often used in 
place of GMOs.
Genetics:  the scientific study of heredity (how particular qualities or traits 
are transmitted from parents to offspring); the term is often used broadly to 
include the ethical, social and legal questions that result from the knowledge 
of genetic science and its application.
Genome:  the sum of the genetic material of a particular organism.
Genomics:  use of information reflecting segments of the genome, 
rather than single genes, in assigning risk for disease, response to treat-
ment or diagnosis.
Genotype:  the collection of actual gene variants (alleles) carried by a cell, 
an organism or an individual. The genotype is distinct from the phenotype, 
which is the sum total of expressed features, including physical characteris-
tics, resulting from a given genotype.

Global Village:  a metaphor for the way in which we experience our world more 
immediately in an age where electronic media allow rapid dissemination of news 
and other information, so that it seems as though the entire planet is shrunken to

Human Genome Project:  an international research effort (led in the United 
States by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy) to 
sequence the base pairs, identify the genes and understand the human genome.  It 
includes efforts to address the ethical, legal and social issues that arise from this 
knowledge. (See Genome)
Intellectual Property:  a term referring to the domain of law and patents refer-
ring distinct types of creations of the mind for which a set of exclusive rights is 
recognized.  Common types of intellectual property include copyrights, trade-
marks, patents, industrial design rights and trade secrets in some jurisdictions.
Koinonia:  Greek word typically translated as community or fellowship or com-
munion, but having implications that include mutuality, reciprocity and unity in 
diversity; these committed to generous caring and a sense of responsibility for 
bearing the burdens of others in the fellowship.
Molecular Biology:  the branch of biology that deals with formation, structure 
and function of molecules.
Molecular Medicine:  the branch of medicine that develops ways to diag-
nose and treat disease by understanding the way genes, proteins and other 
cellular molecules work.  Molecular medicine is based on research that shows 
how certain genes, molecules and cellular functions may become abnormal in 
diseases such as cancer.  Molecular medicine forms the basis for personalized 
medicine (see below).
Mutation:  a permanent and heritable change in the nucleotide sequence of 
DNA.  Mutations may change a single base pair, may insert or delete one or 
more base pairs or may result in complex genetic rearrangements of large 
strings of nucleotides.  In most cases, DNA changes either have no effect or 
cause harm, but occasionally a mutation can improve an organism’s chance of 
surviving and passing the beneficial change on to its descendants.  Larger and 
more complex mutations are more likely to result in a harmful outcome since 
they may impact more than one gene.
A Social Statement

Nucleotide:  the smallest integral subunit of information coded into the 
DNA (or RNA) molecule.
Original Sin:  this traditional Christian teaching refers to the human state 
of alienation from God; it has been understood as a universal and he-
reditary sinfulness or the unconscious human propensity to do evil.  It is 
differentiated from what is called “actual sin,” which is the self-conscious 
violation of God’s law.
Paleontology:  the study of the fossilized remains of life.
Patent:  when applied to genetics, the government regulations or require-
ments conferring the right or title to an individual or organization to genes 
if there has been substantial human intervention.
Pharming:  merger of “farming” and “pharmaceutical,” referring to the 
insertion of genes that code for useful pharmaceutical products into host 
organisms that would not otherwise express those genes.
Pharmacogenetics:  the branch of pharmacology that deals with the influ-
ence of genetic variation on drug response.
Physiology:  study of the functions and activities of living organisms and 
their parts, including all physical and chemical processes.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD):  procedures that are per-
formed on embryos prior to implantation, sometimes even on oocytes (egg 
cells) prior to fertilization, in order to determine the presence of a specific 
genetic sequence associated with a disorder.  PGD is considered an alterna-
tive to prenatal diagnosis.
Prenatal diagnosis:  the use of a wide variety of methods to learn about 
how a pregnancy is developing, with the intention of determining if a de-
tectable abnormality is present.  This includes imaging methods (ultrasound, 
etc.), measuring substances in the maternal blood, and removal of samples 
from the placenta, the amniotic fluid or the fetus itself.
Recombinant DNA:  DNA produced by joining together DNA extracted 
from two or more sources, such as cells or different organisms.
Genetics, Faith and Responsibility
45
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP):  differences in single nucleo-
tides that commonly occur in DNA.  These differences are generally benign 
and occur on average about every 1,000 base pairs.
Synthetic Biology:  design and construction of new biologic functions and 
systems that are not found in nature.
Vocation:  in this statement refers to a calling from God that comes both 
as gift and task.  The ELCA understands baptismal vocation as God’s sav-
ing call to us in baptism that is lived out in joyful response through service 
to the neighbor in daily life.  The human vocation here indicates God’s 
calling to the human race and each individual by virtue of being their Cre-
ator.  It concerns the purpose or goal of human life for every human being, 
whether Christian or not.
Web of  Life:  includes all organisms and recognizes their interdependence.
