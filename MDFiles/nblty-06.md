<b><center>Proposals for Reform<br>
Part II</center></b>
 
<blockquote><blockquote>
 
<p>15. Nor must I forget the poor convents! The evil spirit, who by human laws 
 now confuses all estates in life, and has made them unbearable, has taken 
 possession of certain abbots, abbesses and prelates also, and causes them so 
 to govern their brethren and sisters as to send them the more speedily to 
 hell, and make them lead a wretched life even here; for such is the log of all 
 the devil's martyrs. That is to say, they have reserved to themselves in 
 confession, all, or at least some, of the mortal sins which are secret, so 
 that no brother, on his obedience and on pain of the ban, can absolve another 
 from these sins.[1] Now we do not always find angels everywhere, but we find 
 also flesh and blood, which suffers all bannings and threatenings rather than 
 confess secret sins to the prelates and the appointed confessors. Thus they 
 go to the sacrament with such consciences that they become "irregular"[2] 
 and all sorts of other terrible things. O blind shepherds! O mad prelates! O 
 ravening wolves! </p>
 
<p>To this I say: If a sin is public or notorious, then it is proper that the 
 prelate alone should punish it, and of these sins only and no others he may 
 make exceptions, and reserve them to himself over secret sins he has no 
 authority, even though they were the worst sins that are or ever can be found, 
 and if the prelate makes exceptions of these sins, he is a tyrant, for he has 
 no such right and is interfering in the judgment of God. </p>
 
<p>And so I advise these children, brethren and sisters: If your superiors are 
 unwilling to grant you permission to confess your secret sins to whomever you 
 wish, then take them to whatever brother or sister you will and confess them, 
 receive absolution, and then go and do whatever you wish and ought to do; 
 only believe firmly that you are absolved, and nothing more is needed. And do 
 not allow yourself to be troubled by ban, "irregularity," or any of the other 
 things they threaten; these things are valid only in the case of public or 
 notorious sins which one is unwilling to confess; they do not affect you at 
 all. Why do you try by your threatenings, O blind prelate, to prevent secret 
 sins? Let go what you cannot publicly prove, so that God's judgment and grace 
 may also have its work in your subjects! He did not give them so entirely 
 into your hands as to let them go entirely out of His own! Nay, what you have 
 under your rule is but the smaller part. Let your statues be statutes, but do 
 not exalt them to heaven, to the judgment-seat of God. </p>
 
<p>16. It were also necessary to abolish all anniversary mortuary and "soul" 
 masses,[3] or at least to diminish their number, since we plainly see that 
 they have become nothing but a mockery, by which God is deeply angered, and 
 that their only purpose is money-getting, gorging and drunkenness. What kind 
 of pleasure should God have in such a miserable gabbing or wretched vigils and 
 masses, which is neither reading nor praying, and even when prayed,[4] they 
 are performed not for God's sake and out of willing love, but for money's sake 
 and because they are a bounden duty. Now it is not possible that any work not 
 done out of willing love can please God or obtain anything from Him. And so 
 it is altogether Christian to abolish, or at least diminish, everything which 
 we see growing into an abuse, and which angers rather than reconciles God. It 
 would please me more -- nay, it would be more acceptable to God and far better --  
 that a foundation, church or monastery should put all its anniversary masses 
 and vigils together, and on one day, with hearty sincerity, devotion and 
 faith, hold a true vigil and mass for all its benefactors, rather than hold 
 them by the thousand every year, for each benefactor a special mass, without 
 this devotion and faith. O dear Christians! God cares not for much praying, 
 but for true praying! Nay, He condemns the many and long prayers, and says in 
 Matthew 6:7; 23:14, they will only earn more punishment thereby. But 
 avarice, which cannot trust God, brings such things to pass, fearing that 
 otherwise it must die of hunger! </p>
 
<p>17. Certain of the penalties or punishments of the canon law should also be 
 abolished, especially the interdict, which is, beyond all doubt, an invention 
 of the evil Spirit. It is not a devil's work to try to atone for one sin with 
 many greater sins? And yet, to put God's Word and worship to silence, or to 
 do away with them, is a greater sin than strangling twenty popes at once, and 
 far greater than killing a priest or keeping back some Church property. This 
 is another of the tender virtues taught in the "spiritual law." For one of 
 the reasons why this law is called "spiritual" is because it comes from the 
 Spirit; not, however, from the Holy Spirit, but from the evil spirit. </p>
 
<p>The ban[6] is to be used in no case except where the Scriptures prescribe its 
 use, i.e., against those who do not hold the true faith, or who live in open 
 sin; it is not to be used for the sake of temporal possessions. But now it is 
 the other way around. Everyone believes and lives as he pleases, most of all 
 those who use the ban to plunder and defame other people, and all the bans are 
 now laid only on account of temporal possessions, for which we have no one to 
 thank but the holy "spiritual lawlessness."[7] Of this I have previously said 
 more in the Discourse.[8] </p>
 
<p>The other punishments and penalties, -- suspension, irregularity, aggravation, 
 reaggravation, deposition, lightnings, thunderings, cursings, damnings and the 
 rest of these devices, -- should be buried ten fathoms deep in the earth, so 
 that there should be neither name nor memory of them left on earth. The evil 
 spirit, who has been let loose by the "spiritual law" has brought this 
 terrible plague and misery into the heavenly kingdom of the holy Church, and 
 has accomplished by it nothing else than the destruction and hindrance of 
 souls, so that the word of Christ may well be applied to them[9]; Matthew 
 23:13: "Woe unto you scribes! Ye have taken upon your the authority to teach, 
 and ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men. Ye go not in yourselves, 
 and ye suffer not them that are entering." </p>
 
<p>18. All festivals[10] should be abolished, and Sunday alone retained. If it 
 were desired, however, to retain the festivals of Our Lady and of the greater 
 saints, they should be transferred to Sunday, or observed only by a morning 
 mass, after which all the rest of the day should be a working-day. The reason 
 is this: The feast-days are now abused by drinking, gaming, idleness and all 
 manner of sins, so that on the holy days we anger God more than on other days, 
 and have altogether turned things around; the hold days are not holy and the 
 working days are holy, and not only is no service done to God and His saints 
 by the many holy days, but rather great dishonor. There are, indeed, some mad 
 prelates who think they are doing a good work if they make a festival in honor 
 of St. Ottilia or St. Barbara or some other saint, according to the promptings 
 of their blind devotion; but they would be doing a far better work if they 
 honored the saint by turning a saint's-day into a working day. </p>
 
<p>Over and above the spiritual injury, the common man receives two material 
 injuries from this practice, i.e., he neglects his work and he spends more 
 than at other times; nay, he also weakens his body and unfits it for work. We 
 see this every day, yet no one thinks to make it better. We ought not to 
 consider whether or not the pope has instituted the feasts, and whether we 
 must have dispensation and permission to omit them. If a thing is opposed to 
 God, and harmful to man in body and soul, any community,[11] council[12] or 
 government has not only the right to abolish it and put a stop to it, without 
 the will or knowledge or pope or bishop, but they are bound on their souls' 
 salvation to prevent it, even against the will of pope and bishop, thought 
 these ought to be themselves the first to forbid it. </p>
 
<p>Above all, we ought utterly to abolish the consecration days,[13] since they 
 have become nothing else than taverns, fairs and gaming places,[14] and serve 
 only to the increase of God's dishonor and to the damnation of souls. All the 
 pretence about the custom having had the custom having had a good beginning 
 and being a good work is of no avail. Did not God Himself set aside His own 
 law, which He had given from heaven, when it was perverted and abused? And 
 does He not still daily overturn what He has appointed and destroy what He has 
 made, because of such perversion and abuse? As it is written of Him in Psalm 
 18:27, "With the perverted Thou wilt show Thyself perverse." </p>
 
<p>19. The grades or degrees within which marriage is forbidden should be 
 changed, as, for instance, the sponsorships and the third and fourth degrees 
 and if the pope can grant dispensation in these matters for money and for the 
 sake of the shameful traffic,[15] then every parish priest may give the same 
 dispensations gratis and for the salvation of souls. Yea, would to God that 
 all the things which we must buy at Rome to free ourselves from that 
 money-snare, the canon law, -- such things as indulgences, letters or 
 indulgence, "butter-letters,"[16] "mass-letters,"[17] and all the rest of the 
 <b>confessionalia</b>[18] and knaveries for the sale at Rome, with which the poor 
 folk are deceived and robbed of their money; would to God, I say, that any 
 priest could, without payment, do and omit all these things! For if the pope 
 has the authority to sell his snares for money and his spiritual nets (I 
 should say laws),[19] surely any priest has much more authority to rend his 
 nets and for God's sake to tread them under foot. But if he has not this 
 right, neither has the pope the right to sell them at his shameful fair.[20] </p>
 
<p>This is the place to say too that the fasts should be matters of liberty, and 
 all sorts of food made free, as the Gospel makes them. (Matthew 15:11) For 
 at Rome they themselves laugh at the fasts, making us foreigners eat the oil 
 with which they would not grease their shoes, and afterwards selling us 
 liberty to eat butter and all sorts of other things; yet the holy Apostle says 
 that in all these things we already have liberty through the Gospel. (1 Cor. 
 10:25 ff.) But they have caught us with their canon law and stolen our rights 
 from us, so that we may have to buy them back with money. Thus they have made 
 our consciences so timid and shy that it is no longer easy to preach about 
 this liberty because the common people take such great offense, thinking it is 
 a greater sin to eat butter than to lie, to swear, or even to live unchastely. 
 Nevertheless, what men have decreed, that is the work of man; put it where you 
 will,[21] nothing good ever comes out of it. </p>
 
<p>20. The forest chapels and rustic churches[22] must be utterly destroyed, --  
 those, namely, to which the recent pilgrimages have been directed, --  
 Wilsnack,[23] Sternberg,[24] Trier,[25] the Grimmenthal,[26] and now 
 Regensburg[27] and a goodly number of others. Oh, what a terrible and heavy 
 account will the bishops have to render, who permit this devilish deceit and 
 receive its profits.[28] They should be the first to forbid it, and yet 
they think 
 it a divine and holy thing, and do not see that it is the devil's doing, to 
 strengthen avarice, to create a false, feigned faith, to weaken the parish 
 churches, to multiply taverns and harlotry, to waste money and labor, and to 
 lead the poor folk by the nose. If they had only read the Scriptures to as 
 good purpose as they have read their damnable canon law, they would know well 
 how to deal with this matter. </p>
 
<p>That miracles are done at these places does not help things, for the evil 
 spirit can do miracles, as Christ has told us in Matthew 24:24. If they took 
 the matter seriously and forbade this sort of thing, the miracles would 
 quickly come to an end; (Acts 5:39) on the other hand, if the thing were of 
 God their prohibition would not hinder it. And if there were no other 
 evidence that it is not of God, this would be enough, -- that people run to 
 these places in excited crowds, as though they had lost their reason, like 
 herds of cattle; for this cannot possible be the God. Moreover, God has 
 commanded nothing of all this; there is neither obedience nor merit in it; 
 the bishops, therefore, should boldly step in and keep the folk away. For 
 what is not commanded -- and is concerned for self rather than for the commands 
 of God -- that is surely the devil himself. Then, too, the parish churches 
receive 
 injury, because they are held in smaller honor. In short, these things are 
 signs of great unbelief among the people; if they truly believed, they would 
 have all that they need in their own churches, for to them they are commanded 
 to go. </p>
 
<p>But what shall I say? Every one[29] plans only how he may establish and 
 maintain such a place of pilgrimage in his diocese and is not at all concerned 
 to have the people believe and live aright; the rulers are like the people; 
 one blind man leads another. (Matthew 13:14) Nay, where pilgrimages are not 
 successful, they begin to canonize saints,[30] not in honor of the saints --  
 for they are sufficiently honored without canonization -- but in order to draw 
 crowds and bring in money. Pope and bishop help along; it rains indulgences; 
 there is always money enough for that. But for what God has commanded no one 
 provides; no one runs after these things; there is no money for them. Alas, 
 that we should be so blind! We not only give the devil his own way in his 
 tricks, but we even strengthen him in his wantonness and increase his pranks. 
 I would that the dear saints were left in peace, and the poor folk not lead 
 astray! What spirit has given the pope the authority to canonize the saints? 
 Who tells him whether they are saints or not? Are there not already sins 
 enough on earth, that we too must tempt God, interfere in His judgment and set 
 up the dear saints as lures for money? </p>
 
<p>Therefore I advise that the saints be left to canonize themselves. Yea, it is 
 God alone who should canonize them. And let every man stay in his own parish, 
 where he finds more than in all the shrines of pilgrimage, even though all the 
 shrines were one. Here we find baptism, the sacrament, preaching and our 
 neighbor, and these are greater things, than all the saints in heaven, for it 
 is by God's Word and sacrament that they have all been made saints. So long 
 as we despise such great things God is just in the wrathful judgment by which 
 He appoints the devil to lead us hither and thither, to establish pilgrimages, 
 to found churches and chapels, to secure the canonization of saints, and to do 
 other such fool's-works, by which we depart from true faith into new, false 
 misbelief. This is what he did in olden times to the people of Israel, when 
 he led them away from the temple at Jerusalem to countless other places, 
 though he did it in the name of God and under the plausible guise of holiness, 
 though all the prophets preached against it and were persecuted for so doing. 
 But now no one preaches against it, perhaps for fear that pope, priests and 
 monks would persecute him also. In this way St. Antoninus of Florence[31] 
 and certain others must now be made saints and canonized, that their holiness, 
 which would otherwise have served only for the glory of God and as a good 
 example, may serve to bring in fame and money. </p>
 
<p>Although the canonizing of saints may have been good in olden times, it is not 
 good now; just as many other things were good in olden times and are now 
 scandalous and injurious, such as feast-days, church-treasures and 
 church-adornment. For it is evident that through the canonizing of saints 
 neither God's glory nor the improvement of Christians is sought, but only 
 money and glory, in that one church wants to be something more and have 
 something more than others, and would be sorry if another had the same thing 
 and its advantage were common property. So entirely, in these last, evil 
 days, have spiritual goods been misused and applied to the gaining of temporal 
 goods, that everything, even God Himself, has been forced into the service of 
 avarice. And even these special advantages lead only to dissensions, 
 divisions and pride, in that the churches, differing from one another, hold 
 each other in contempt, and exalt themselves one above another, though all the 
 gifts which God bestows are the common and equal property of all churches and 
 should only serve the cause of unity. The pope, too, is glad for the present 
 state of affairs; he would be sorry if all Christians were equal and were at 
 one. </p>
 
<p>This is the place to speak of the church licenses, bulls and other things 
 which the pope sells at his flaying-place in Rome. We should either abolish 
 them or disregard them, or at least make them the common property of all 
 churches. For if he sells or gives away licenses and privileges, indulgences, 
 graces, advantages, faculties[32] to Wittenberg, to Halle, to Venice and, 
 above, all to his own Rome, why does he not give these things to all churches 
 alike? Is he not bound to do for all Christians, gratis and for God's sake, 
 everything that he can, and even to shed his blood for them? Tell me, then, 
 why he gives or sells to one church and not to another? Or must the accursed 
 money make, in the eyes of His Holiness, so great a difference among 
 Christians, who all have the same baptism, Word, faith, Christ, God and all 
 things? (Eph. 4:4 f.) Are we to be blind while we have eyes to see, fools 
 while we have our reason, that they expect us to worship such greed, knavery 
 and humbug? He is a shepherd, -- yes, so long as you have money, and no 
 longer! And yet they are not ashamed of their knavery, leading us hither and 
 yon with their bulls! Their one concern is the accursed money, and nothing 
 else! </p>
 
<p>My advice is this: If such fool's-work cannot be abolished, then every pious 
 Christian man should open his eyes, and not be misled by the hypocritical 
 Roman bulls and seals, stay at home in his own church and be content with his 
 baptism, his Gospel, his faith, his Christ and with God, Who is everywhere the 
 same; and let the pope remain a blind leader of the blind. (Matt. 15:4) Neither 
 angel nor pope can give you as much as God gives you in your parish-church. 
 Nay, the pope leads you away from the gifts of God, which you have without 
 pay, to his gifts, which you must buy; and he have without pay, to his gifts, 
 which you must buy; and he gives you lead[33] for gold, hide for meat, the 
 string for the purse, wax for honey, words for goods, the letter for the 
 spirit. You see this before your very eyes, but you are unwilling to notice 
 it. If you are to ride to heaven on his wax and parchment, your chariot 
 will soon go to pieces, and you will fall into hell, not in God's name! </p>
 
<p>Let this be your fixed rule: What you must buy from the pope is neither good 
 nor of God; for what is from God, to wit, the Gospel and the works of God; for 
 what is from God, to wit, the Gospel and the works of God, is not only given 
 without money, but the whole world is punished and damned because it has not 
 been willing to receive it as a free gift. We have deserved of God that we 
 should be so deceived, because we have despised His holy Word and the grace of 
 baptism, as St. Paul says: 2 Thess. 2:11 f.: "God shall send a strong delusion 
 upon all those who have not received the truth to their salvation, to the end 
 that they may believe and follow after lies and knavery," which serves them 
 right. </p>
 
<p>21. One of our greatest necessities is the abolition of all begging 
 throughout Christendom. Among Christians no one ought to go begging! It 
 would also be easy to make a law, if only we had the courage and the serious 
 intention, to the effect that every city should provide for its own poor, and 
 admit no foreign beggars by whatever name they might be called, whether 
 pilgrims or mendicant monks. Every city could support its own poor, and if it 
 were too small, the people in the surrounding villages also should be exhorted 
 to contribute, since in any case they have to feed so many vagabonds and 
 knaves in the guise of mendicants. In this way, too, it could be known who 
 were really poor and who not. </p>
 
<p>There would have to be an overseer or warden who knew all the poor and 
 informed the city council or the priests what they needed; or some other 
 better arrangement might be made. In my judgment there is no other business 
 in which so much knavery and deceit are practiced as in begging, and yet it 
 could all be easily abolished. Moreover, this free and universal begging 
 hurts the common people. I have considered that each of the five or six 
 mendicant orders[34] visits the same place more than six or seven times every 
 year; besides these there are the common beggars, the "stationaries"[35] and 
 the palmers,[36] so that it has been reckoned that every town is laid under 
 tribute about sixty times a year, not counting what is given to the government 
 in taxes, imposts and assessments, what is stolen by the Roman See with its 
 wares, and what is uselessly consumed. Thus it seems to me one of God's 
 greatest miracles that we can continue to support ourselves. </p>
 
<p>To be sure, some think that in this way[37] the poor would not be so well 
 provided for and that not so many great stone houses and monasteries would be 
 built. This I can well believe. Nor is it necessary. He who wishes to be 
 poor should not be rich; and if he wishes to be rich, let him put his hand to 
 the plow and seek his riches in the earth! It is enough if the poor are 
 decently cared for, so that they do not die of hunger or of cold. It is not 
 fitting that one man should live in idleness on another's labor, or be rich 
 and live comfortably at the cost of another's discomfort, according to the 
 present perverted custom; for St. Paul says, 2 Thess. 3:10: "If a man will not 
 work, neither shall he eat." God has not decreed that any man shall live from 
 another's goods save only the priests, who rule and preach, and these because 
 of their spiritual labor, as Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9:14, and Christ also 
 says to the Apostles, Luke 10:7: "Every laborer is worthy of his hire." </p>
 
<p>22. It is also to be feared that the many masses which are endowed in the 
 foundation sand monasteries are not only of little use, but greatly arouse the 
 wrath of God. It would therefore be profitable not to endow any more, but 
 rather to abolish many that are already endowed, since we see that they are 
 regarded only as sacrifices and good works,[39] though they are really 
 sacraments, just like baptism and penance,[40] which profit only those who 
 receive them, and no others. But now the custom has crept in, that masses are 
 said for the living and the dead, and all hopes are built upon them; for this 
 reason so many of them have been founded and the present state of affairs has 
 come about. </p>
 
<p>My proposal is perhaps too novel an daring, especially for those who fear 
 that through the discontinuance of these masses their trade and livelihood may 
 be destroyed, and so I must refrain from saying more about it until we have 
 come back to a correct understanding of what the mass is and what it is good 
 for. These many years, alas, it has been made a trade practiced for a temporal 
 livelihood, so that I would henceforth advise a man to become a shepherd or 
 to seek some other trade rather than become a shepherd or to seek some 
 other trade rather than become a priest or a monk, unless he first knows 
 well what it is to celebrate mass. </p>
 
<p>I am not speaking, however, of the old foundations and cathedrals, which were 
 doubtless established in order that the children of the nobility (since, 
 according to the customs of the German nation not all of them can become heirs 
 or rulers), might be provided for in these foundations, and there be free to 
 serve God, to study, to become scholars and to make scholars. But I am 
 speaking of the new foundations, which have been established only for the 
 saying of prayers and masses; for after their example, even the old 
 foundations have been burdened with like prayers and masses, so that they are 
 of little or no profit; though it is also of God's grace that they too come at 
 last, as they deserve, to the dregs, i.e., to the wailing of organs and of 
 choral singers, and to dead, cold masses, by which the incomes of the worldly 
 endowments are gotten and spent. Such things pope, bishops and doctors should 
 examine and proscribe: but now it is they who are most given to them. They 
 let everything pass, if only it brings in money; one blind man is always 
 leading another. This is the work of avarice and of the spiritual law. </p>
 
<p>Again, no one person should be allowed any longer to hold more than one 
 canonry or prebend. He must be content with a modest position, that some one 
 else may also have something. This would do away with the excuses of those 
 who say that they must hold more than one such office to "maintain a proper 
 station." A "proper station" might be so broadly interpreted that a whole 
 land would not be enough to maintain it! Moreover avarice and veiled distrust 
 of God assuredly go with it, so that what is alleged to be the need of "a 
 proper station" is often nothing else than avarice and distrust. </p>
 
<p>23. Sodalities,[41] indulgences, letters of indulgence, "butter-letter,"[42] 
 mass-letters,[43] dispensations, and everything else of the sort, are to be 
 drowned and destroyed. There is nothing good in them. If the pope has the 
 power to grant you dispensation to eat butter and to absent yourself from 
 mass, then he ought also be able to leave this power to the priests, from 
 whom, indeed, he has no right to take it. I speak especially of those 
 fraternities in which indulgences, masses and good works are portioned out. 
 Dear friend, in your baptism you entered into a fraternity with Christ, all 
 the angels, saints and Christians on earth. Hold to this fraternity and live 
 up to its demands, and you have fraternities enough. The others -- let them 
 glitter as they will -- are but as counters compared with guldens. But if 
 there were a fraternity which contributed money to feed the poor or to help 
 somebody in some other way, such a one would be good, and would have its 
 indulgence and its merit in heaven. Now, however, they have become excuses 
 for gluttony and drunkenness. </p>
 
<p>Above all, we should drive out of German lands the papal legates with their 
 "faculties,"[45] which they sell us for large sums of money, though that is 
 sheer knavery. For example, in return for money they legalize unjust gains, 
 dissolve oaths, vows and agreements, break and teach men to break the faith 
 and fealty which they have pledged to one another; and they say the pope has 
 the authority to do this. It is the evil Spirit who bids them say this. Thus 
 they sell us a doctrine of devils, and take money for teaching us sin and 
 leading us to hell. </p>
 
<p>If there were no other evil wiles to prove the pope the true Antichrist, yet 
 this one thing were enough to prove it. Hearest thou this, O pope, not most 
 holy, but most sinful? O that God from heaven would soon destroy thy throne 
 and sink it in the abyss of hell! Who hath given thee authority to exalt 
 thyself above thy God, to break and to loose His commandments, and to teach 
 Christians, especially the German nation, praised in all history for its 
 nobility, its constancy and fidelity, to be inconstant, perjurers, traitors, 
 profligates, faithless? God hath commanded to keep oath and faith even with 
 an enemy, and thou undertakest to loose this His commandment, and ordainest in 
 thine heretical, antichristian decretals that thou hast His power. Thus 
 through thy throat and through thy pen the wicked Satan doth lie as he hath 
 never lied before. O Christ, my Lord, look down, let the day of thy judgment 
 break, and destroy the devil's nest at Rome! Here sitteth the man of whom St. 
 Paul hath said (2 Thess. 2:3 f.) that he shall exalt himself above Thee, sit 
 in Thy Church and set himself up as God, -- the man of sin and the son of 
 perdition! What else is the papal power than only the teaching and increasing 
 of sin and evil, the leading of souls to damnation under Thy name and guise? </p>
 
<p>In olden times the children of Israel had to keep the oath which they had 
 unwittingly been deceived into giving to their enemies, the Gibeonites, and 
 King Zedekiah was miserably lost, with all his people, because he broke this 
 oath to the King of Babylon. (Josh. 9:19 ff.; 2 Kings 24:20; 25:4 ff.) Even 
 among us, a hundred years ago, that fine king of Hungary and Poland, 
 Wladislav,[46] was slain by the Turk, with so many noble people, because he 
 allowed himself to be deceived by the papal legate and cardinal, and broke the 
 good and advantageous treaty which he had sworn with the Turk. The pious 
 Emperor Sigismund had no good fortune after the Council of Constance, when 
 allowed the knaves to break the safe-conduct which had been given to John Hus 
 and Jerome,[47] and all the trouble between us and the Bohemians was the 
 consequence. Even in our own times, God help us! How much Christian blood has 
 been shed over the oath and alliance which Pope Julius made between the 
 Emperor Maximilian and King Louis of France,[48] and afterwards broke? How 
 could I tell all the troubles which the popes have stirred up by the devilish 
 presumption with which they annul oaths and vows which have been made between 
 great princes, making a jest of these things, and taking money for it. I have 
 hopes that the judgment day is at the door; nothing can possibly be worse than 
 the Roman See. He suppresses God's commandment, he exalts his own commandment 
 over it; if he is not Antichrist, then let some one else tell who he can be! 
 But more of this another time, and better. </p>
 
<p>24. It is high time that we seriously and honestly consider the case of the 
 Bohemians,[49] and come into union with them so that the terrible slander, 
 hatred and envy on both sides may cease. As befits my folly, I shall be the 
 first to submit an opinion on this subject, with due deference to every one 
 who may understand the case better than I. </p>
 
<p>First, We must honestly confess the truth, stop justifying ourselves, and 
 grant the Bohemians that John Hus and Jerome of Prague were burned at 
 Constance in violation of the papal, Christian, imperial safe-conduct and 
 oath; whereby God's commandment was sinned against and the Bohemians were 
 given ample cause for bitterness; and although they ought to have been perfect 
 and to have patiently endured this great injustice and disobedience of God on 
 our part, nevertheless they were not bound to approve of it and to acknowledge 
 that it was well done. Nay, even to-day they should give up life and limb 
 rather than confess that it is right to violate an imperial, papal Christian 
 safe-conduct, and faithlessly to act contrary to it. So then, although it is 
 the impatience of the Bohemians which is at fault, yet the pope and his 
 followers are still more to blame for all the trouble, error and loss of souls 
 that have followed upon that council. </p>
 
<p>I have no desire to pass judgment at this time upon John Hus's articles or to 
 defend his errors, though I have not yet found any errors in his writings, and 
 I am quite prepared to believe that it was neither fair judgment nor honest 
 condemnation which was passed by those who, in their faithless dealing, 
 violated a Christian safe-conduct and a commandment of God. Beyond doubt they 
 were possessed rather by the evil spirit than by the Holy Spirit. No one will 
 doubt that the Holy Spirit does not act contrary to the commandment of God; 
 and no one is so ignorant as not to know that the violation of faith and of a 
 safe-conduct is contrary to the commandment of God, even though they had been 
 promised to the devil himself, still more when the promise was made to a mere 
 heretic. It is also quite evident that such a promise was made to John Hus 
 and the Bohemians and was not kept, but that he was burned in spite of it. I 
 do not wish, however, to make John Hus a saint or a martyr, as do some of the 
 Bohemians, though I confess that injustice was done him, and that his books 
 and doctrines were unjustly condemned; for the judgments of God are secret and 
 terrible, and no one save God alone should undertake to reveal or utter them. </p>
 
<p>All I wish to say is this: though he were never so wicked a heretic, 
 nevertheless he was burned unjustly and against God's commandment, and the 
 Bohemians should not be forced to approve of such conduct, or else we shall 
 never come into unity. Not obstinacy but the open admission of truth must 
 make us one. It is useless to pretend, as was done at the time, that a 
 safe-conduct given to a heretic need not be kept.[50] That is as much as to 
 say that God's commandments are not to be kept to the end that God's 
 commandments may be kept. The devil made them mad and foolish, so that they 
 did not know what they were saying or doing. God has commanded that a 
 safe-conduct shall be kept. This commandment we should keep though the world 
 fall. How much more, when it is only a question of freeing a heretic! We 
 should vanquish heretics with books, not with burning; for so the ancient 
 fathers did. If it were a science to vanquish the heretics with fire, then 
 the hangmen would be the most learned doctors on earth; we should no longer 
 need to study, but he who overcame another by force might burn him at the 
 stake. </p>
 
<p>Second, The emperor and the princes should send to the Bohemians some pious 
 and sensible bishops and scholars; but by no means a cardinal or papal legate 
 or inquisitor, for those people are utter ignoramuses as regards things 
 Christian; they seek not the welfare of souls but, like all the pope's 
 hypocrites, only their own power, profit and glory' indeed, they were the 
 prime movers in this miserable business at Constance. The men thus sent into 
 Bohemia should inform themselves about the faith of the Bohemians, and whether 
 it be possible to unite all their sects. Then the pope should, for their 
 souls' sake, lay aside his supremacy for the time being, and, according to the 
 decree of the most Christian Council of Nicaea,[51] allow the Bohemians to 
 choose one of their number to be Archbishop of Prague,[52] and he should be 
 confirmed by the bishop of Olmutz in Moravia, or the bishop of Gran in 
 Hungary, or the bishop of Gnesen in Poland, or the bishop of Magdeburg in 
 Germany.[53] It will be enough if he is confirmed by one or two of these, as 
 was the custom in the time of St. Cyprian.[54] The pope has no right to 
 oppose such an arrangement, and if he does oppose it, he becomes a wolf and a 
 tyrant; no one should follow him and his ban should be met with a counter-ban. </p>
 
<p>If, however, it were desired, in honor of the See of St. Peter, to do this 
 with the pope's consent, I should be satisfied, provided it does not cost the 
 Bohemians a heller and the pope does not bind them at all nor make them 
 subject to his tyrannies by oaths and obligations, as he does all other 
 bishops, in despite of God and of justice. If he will not be satisfied with 
 the honor of having his consent asked, then let them not bother any more about 
 him[55] and his rights, laws and tyrannies; let the election suffice, and let 
 the blood of all the souls which are endangered cry out against him, for no 
 one should consent to injustice; it is enough to have offered tyranny an 
 honor. If it cannot be otherwise, then an election and approval by the common 
 people can even now be quite as valid as a confirmation by a tyrant; but I 
 hope this will not be necessary. Some of the Romans or the good bishops and 
 scholars will sometime mare and oppose papal tyranny. </p>
 
<p>I would also advise against compelling them to abolish both kinds in the 
 sacrament,[56] since that is neither unchristian nor heretical, but they 
 should be allowed to retain their own practice, if they wish. Yet the new 
 bishop should be careful that no discord arise because of such a practice is 
 wrong;[57] just as it ought not to cause dissension that the clergy differ 
 from the laity in manner of life and in dress. In like manner if they were 
 unwilling to receive the Roman canon law, they should not be forced to do so, 
 but we should first make sure that they live in accordance with faith and with 
 the Scriptures. For Christian faith and life can well exist without the 
 intolerable laws of the pope, nay, they cannot well exist unless there be 
 fewer of these Roman laws, or none at all. In baptism we have become free and 
 have been made subject to God's Word only; why should any man ensnare us in 
 his words? As St. Paul says, 1 Cor. 7:23 and Gal. 5:1: "Ye have become free, 
 be not servants of men," i.e. of those who rule with man-made laws. </p>
 
<p>If I knew that the Picards[58] held no other error touching the sacrament of 
 the altar except that they believe that the bread and wine are present in 
 their true nature, but that the body and blood of Christ are truly present 
 under them, then I would not condemn them, but would let them enter the 
 obedience of the bishop of Prague. For it is not an article of faith that 
 bread and wine are not essentially and naturally in the sacrament, but this is 
 an opinion of St. Thomas[59] and the pope. On the other hand, it is an 
 article of faith that in the natural bread and wine the true natural body and 
 blood of Christ are present.[60] And so we should tolerate the opinions of 
 both sides until they come to an agreement, because there is no danger in 
 believing that bread is there or is not there. For we have to endure many 
 practices and ordinances so long as they are not harmful to faith. On the 
 other hand, if they had a different faith,[61] I would rather have them 
 outside the Church; yet I would teach them the truth. </p>
 
<p>Whatever other errors and schisms might be discovered in Bohemia should be 
 tolerated until the archbishop had been restored and had gradually brought all 
 the people together again in one common doctrine. They will assuredly never 
 be united by force, nor by defiance, nor by haste; it will take time and 
 forbearance. Had not even Christ to tarry with His disciples a long while and 
 bear with their unbelief, until they believed His resurrections? If they but 
 had again a regular bishop and church order, without Roman tyranny, I could 
 hope that things would soon be better. </p>
 
<p>The restoration of the temporal goods which formerly belonged to the Church 
 should not be too strictly demanded, but since we are Christians and each is 
 bound to help the rest, it is in our power, for the sake of unity, to give 
 them these things and let them keep them in the sight of God and men. For 
 Christ says, Matt. 18:19 f.: "Where two are at one with each other on earth, 
 there am I in the midst of them." Would to God that on both sides we were 
 working toward this unity, offering our hands to one another in brotherly 
 humility, and not standing stubbornly on our powers or rights! Love is 
 greater and more necessary than the papacy at Rome, for there can be papacy 
 without love and love without papacy. </p>
 
<p>With this counsel I shall have done what I could. If the pope or his 
 followers hinder it, (Phil. 2:4), they shall render an account for seeking 
 their own things rather than the things of their neighbor, contrary to the 
 love of God. The pope ought to give up his papacy and all his possessions and 
 honors, if he could by that means save one soul; but now he would let the 
 world go to destruction rather than yield a hair's-breadth of his presumptuous 
 authority. And yet he would be the "most holy"! Here my responsibility ends.</p>

<p>[23] A little town in East Prussia, where was displayed a sacramental wafer, 
 said to have been miraculously preserved from a fire which destroyed the 
 church in 1383. It was alleged that at certain times this wafer exuded drops 
 of blood, reverenced as the blood of Christ, and many miracles were said to 
 have been performed by it. Wilsnack early became a favorite resort for 
 pilgrims. In 1412 the archbishop of Prague, at the instigation of John Hus, 
 forbade the Bohemians to go there. Despite the protests of the Universities 
 of Leipzig and Erfurt, Pope Eugenius IV in 1446 granted special indulgences 
 for this pilgrimage, and the popularity of the shrine was undiminished until 
 the time the Reformation. Cf. Realencyk, xxi, pp. 347 ff. </p>
 
<p>[24] In Meckleburg, where another relic of "the Holy Blood" was displayed 
 after 1491. Cf. Benrath, pp. 104 f. </p>
 
<p>[25] The "Holy Coat of Trier" was believed by the credulous to be the 
 seamless coat of Christ, which the soldiers did not rend. It was first 
 exhibited in 1512, but was said to have been presented to the cathedral church 
 of Trier by the Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great. </p>
 
<p>[26] Pilgrimage to the Grimmenthal in Meiningen began in 1449. An image of 
 the Virgin, declared to have been miraculously created, was displayed there, 
 and was alleged to work wonderful cures, especially of syphilis. </p>
 
<p>[27] The "Fair Virgin (<b>die schone Maria</b>) of Regensburg" was an image of the 
 Virgin similar to that exhibited in the Grimmenthal. The shrine was opened 
 March 45, 1519, and within a month 50,000 pilgrims are said to have worshipped 
 there. (Weimar Ed., VI, 447, note 1). For another explanation see Benrath, 
 p. 105. </p>
 
<p>[28] The pilgrimages were a source of large revenue, derived from the sale of 
 medals which were worn as amulets, the fees for masses at the shrines, and the 
 free-will offerings of the pilgrims. A large part of this revenue accrued to 
 the bishop of the diocese, though the popes never overlooked the profits which 
 the sale of indulgences for worship at these shrines could produce. In the 
 Gravamina of 1521 complaint is made that the bishops demand at least 25 to 33 
 per cent of the offerings made at shrines of pilgrimage (WREDE, op. cit., II, 
 687). </p>
 
<p>[29] i.e., Every bishop. </p>
 
<p>[30] The possession of a saint gave a church a certain reputation and 
 distinction, which was sufficiently coveted to make local Church authorities 
 willing to pay roundly for the canonization of a departed bishop or other 
 local dignitary. Cf. Hutten's <b>Vadiscus</b> (Bocking, IV, 232). </p>
 
<p>[31] Archbishop of Florence (died 1459). He was canonized, May 31, 1523, by

 seals depend; "wax," the seal holding the cord to the parchment. </p>
 
<p>[34] Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians, Carmelites and Servites. </p>
 
<p>[35] <b>Botschaften</b>, interpreted by Benrath (p. 105), Clemen (I, 406, note) and 
 Weimar Ed. (VI, 406, note 1) as a reference to the <b>stationarii</b>. They were 
 wandering beggars who, for an alms, would enroll the contributor in the list 
 of beneficiaries of their patron saint, an alleged insurance against disease, 
 accident, etc. They were classified according to the names of their patron 
 saints, St. Anthony, St. Hurbert, St. Valentine, etc. Protest against their 
 operations were raised at the Diets of Worms (1521) and Nurnberg (1523). 
 Included in these protests are the <b>terminarii</b>, i.e., the collectors of alms 
 sent out by the mendicant orders. See WREDE, op. cit., II, 678, 688, III, 
 651, and Benrath, loc. cit. </p>
 
<p>[36] <b>Wallbruder</b>, the professional pilgrims who spent their lives in wandering 
 from one place of pilgrimage to another and subsisted on the alms of the 
 faithful. </p>
 
<p>[37] i.e., If the plan above proposed were adopted. </p>
 
<p>[38] See above, p. 129, note 1. </p>
 
<p>[39] See <b>Treatise on the New Testament</b>, Vol. I, pp. 308 ff. </p>
 
<p>[40] In the Babylonian Captivity (below, pp. 291 f.) Luther definitely 
 excludes penance from the number of sacraments, but see also p. 177. </p>
 
<p>[41] The <b>sodalities</b> ("fraternities," "confraternities"), still an important 
 institution in the Roman Church, flourished especially in the XVI Century. 
 They are associations for devotional purposes. The members of the sodalities 
 are obligated to the recitation of certain prayers and the attendance upon 
 certain masses at stipulated times. By virtue of membership in the 
 association each member is believed to participate in the benefits accruing 
 from these "good works" of all the members. In the case of most of the 
 <b>sodalities</b> membership entitled the member to the enjoyment of certain 
 indulgences. In 1520 Wittenberg boasted of 20 fraternities, Cologne of 80, 
 Hamburg of more than 100 (Realencyk., III, 437). In 1519 Degenhard 
 Peffinnger, of Wittenberg, was a member of 8 such fraternities in his home 
 city, and of 27 in other places. For Luther's view of the <b>sodalities</b> see 
 above, pp. 8, 26 ff. On the whole subject see Benrath, pp. 106 f.; KOLDE in 
 Realencyk., III, pp. 434 ff.; LEA, <b>Hist. Of Conf. And Indulg</b>, III, pp. 
470 ff. </p>
 
<p>[42] See above, p. 98, note 2. </p>
 
<p>[43] See above, p. 128, note 5. </p>
 
<p>[44] The excesses committed at the feasts of the religious societies were 
 often a public scandal. See LEA, <b>Hist. of Conf. and Indulg</b>, III, pp. 437 ff. </p>
 
<p>[45] "Faculties" were extraordinary powers, usually for the granting of 
 indulgences and of absolution in "reserved cases" (see above, p. 105, note 3). 
 They were bestowed by the pope and could be revoked by him at any time. 
 Sometimes they were given to local Church officials, but were usually held by 
 the legates or commissaries sent from Rome. Complaints were made at the Diet 
 of Worms (1520) and Nurnberg (1523) that the papal commissaries and legates 
 interfered with the ordinary methods of ecclesiastical jurisdiction and 
 appointment. See WREDE, op. cit., II, 673, III, 653. </p>
 
<p>[46] Wladislav I forced the Sultan to sue for peace in 1443. At the 
 instigation of the papal legate, Cardinal Caesarini, who represented that the 
 treaty had not been approved by the pope, and absolved the king from the 
 fulfillment of its conditions he renewed the war in 1444. At the battle of 
 Varna, Nov. 10th, 1444, the Hungarians were decisively defeated, and 
 Wladislav and Caesarini both killed. See CREIGHTON, <b>Hist. of the Papacy</b>, III, 
 67. </p>
 
<p>[47] John Hus and Jerome of Prague were convicted of heresy by the Council of 
 Constance and burned at the stake, the former July 6th, 1415, the latter May 
 30th, 1416. Hus had come to Constance under the safe-conduct of the Emperor 
 Sigismund. Luther is in error when he assumes that Jerome had a similar 
 safe-conduct. In September, 1415, the Council passed a decree which asserted 
 that "either by natural, divine or human law was any promise to be observed to 
 the prejudice of the catholic faith." On the whole matter of the safe-conduct 
 and its violation see LEA, <b>Hist. of the Inquisition in the MA</b>, II, pp. 
453 ff. </p>
 
<p>[48] The League of Cambray, negotiated in 1508 for war against Venice. In 
 1510 Venice made terms with the pope and detached him from the alliance, and 
 the result was war between the pope and the King of France. See <b>Cambridge 
 Modern History</b>, I, pp. 130 ff., and literature there cited. </p>
 
<p>[49] i.e., The Hussites. After the martyrdom of Hus his followers maintained 
 for a time a strong organization in Bohemia, and resisted with arms all 
 attempts to force them into conformity with the Roman Church. The Council of 
 Basel succeeded (1434) in reconciling the more moderate party among the 
 Bohemians (the Calixtines) by allowing the administration of the cup to the 
 laity. The more extreme party, however, refused to subscribe the Compactata 
 of Basel. Though they soon ceased to be a factor in the political situation, 
 they remained outside the Church and perpetuated the teachings of Hus in 
 sectarian organizations. The most important of these, the so-called Bohemian 
 Brethren, had extended into Poland and Prussia before Luther's time. See 
 Realencyk., III, 465-467. </p>
