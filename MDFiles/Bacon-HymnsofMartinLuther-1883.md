This

is commonly known under the
title,
" Es
ist gewisslicli an der Zeit,"
and, in a
modified
form,
in
England
and
America,
as
"Luther's Judgment Hymn,"
from
its
association with
a hymn
of W.

CoUyer,
partly derived

Psalm XII—Salvum me fac, Domine.
LOOK DOWN, O LORD, FROM HEA VEN BEHOLD.
Translation chiefly from Frances
Elizabeth Cox, in " Hymns from the German."
First Melody, 1524,
is the tune of the hymn of Paul Speratus,
" Es ist das Heil uns kommen
her,"
the singing
of which under Luther's window
at
Wittenberg
is
related
to
have
made so deep an impression on
the Reformer.
The
anecdote
is confirmed
by the
fact
that
in
the "Eight Songs," Luther's
three versions
of
Psalms
are
all
set
to this
tune.

This

INTRODUCTION.
A
FIT motto for the
history of the Reformation would be those words
out
of the
history of the Day of Pentecost, " How hear we, every
man
in our own tongue wherein we were born ....
the wonderful works
of God
! "
The ruling thought of the pre-reformation period was not more
the maintenance
of one Holy Roman Church than
of one Holy Roman
Empire, each of which was to comprehend
all Christendom.
The language
of the Roman Church and Empire was the sacred language
in comparison
with which the languages of men's common speech were reckoned common
and unclean.
The coming-in of the Reformation was the aw^akening of indi-
vidual life, by enforcing the sense of each man's direct responsibility to God
but
it was equally the quickening of a true national
life.
In the light of the
new era, the realization of the promise of the oneness of the Church was no
longer to be sought
in
the universal dominance of a
hierarchical corpora-
tion
; nor was the "mystery" proclaimed by Paul,
that "the nations were
fellow-heirs and of one body," to be fulfilled in the subjugation of all nations
to a central potentate.
According to the spirit of the Reformation, the One
Church was to be, not a corporation, but a communion—the communion of
saints
; and the unity of mankind, in
its many nations, was to be
a unity of
the spirit in the bond of mutual peace.
The two great works of Martin Luther were those by which he gave to
the common people a vernacular Bible and vernacular worship, that through
the one, God might speak directly to the people
; and in the other, the people
might speak directly to God.
Luther's Bible and Luther's Hymns gave life
not only to the churches of the Reformation, but to German nationality and
the German language.
xiv
INTRODUCTION.
Concerning the hymns of Luther the words of several notable writers
are on record, and are worthy to be prefixed to the volume of them.
Says Spangenberg, yet in Luther's life-time, in his Preface to the Citkara
Lutheri, 1545
:
" One must certainly let
this be true, and remain
true, that among all Master-
singers from the days of the Apostles until now, Luther is and always will be the best
and most accomplished
;
in whose hymns and songs one does not find a vain or need-
less word.
AH flows and falls in the sweetest and neatest manner, full of spirit and
doctrine, so that his every word gives outright a sermon of his own, or at least a sin-
gular reminiscence.
There is nothing forced, nothing foisted in or patched up, noth-
ing fragmentary.
The rhymes are easy and good, the words choice and proper, the
meaning clear and intelligible, the melodies lovely and hearty, and in siimuid all is so
rare and
majestic, so
full of pith and power,
so cheering and
comforting, that, in
sooth, you will not find his equal, much less his master." *
The follov/ing words have often been quoted from Samuel Taylor Cole-
ridge
:
" Luther did
as much for the Reformation by his hymns
as by his translation
of the Bible.
In Germany the hymns are known by heart by every peasant
; they
advise, they argue from the hymns, and every soul in the church praises God like a
Christian, with words which are natural and yet sacred to his mind."
A
striking passage
in
an
article by Heine
in
the Revue
des Deux
Mondes for March, 1834, is transcribed by Michelet in his Life of Luther:
" Not
less remarkable, not
less
significant than
his prose works, are Luther's
poems, those
stirring songs which, as
it were, escaped from him
in the very midst
of his combats and his necessities
like a flower making its way from between rough
stones, or a moonbeam gleaming amid dark clouds.
Luther loved music
;
indeed,
he wrote
treatises on the
art.
Accordingly his versification
is highly harmonious,
so that he may be called the Swan of Eisleben.
Not that he is by any means gentle
or swan-like in the songs which he composed for the purpose of exciting the'courage
of the people.
In these he is fervent, fierce.
The hymn which he composed on his
way to Worms, and which he and his companions chanted as they entered that city.f
* Quoted in the Christian Examiner, i860, p. 240
; transcribed by the Rev. Bernhard Pick in " Luther
as a Hymnist," p. 23
; Philadelphia, 1875.
t The popular impression that the hymn " Ein" feste Burg" was produced in these circumstances is
due, doubtless, to a parallel in the third stanza, to the famous saying imputed to Luther on
the eve of the
INTRODUCTION.

is a regular war-song.
The old cathedral trembled when
it heard these novel sounds.
The very rooks flew from their nests in the towers.
That hymn, the Marseillaise of
the Reformation, has preserved to this day its potent spell over German hearts."
The words of Thomas Carlyle
are not
less emphatic, while they pene-
trate deeper into the secret of the power of Luther's hymns
" The
great
Reformer's love
of music and
poetry,
it has often been remarked,
is one of the most significant
features
in
his
character.
But indeed
if every great
man is intrinsically a poet, an idealist, with more or
less completeness of utterance,
which of all our great men, in these modern
ages, had such an endowment
in
that
kind as Luther?
He
it was, emphatically, who stood based on
the
spiritual world
of man, and only by the footing and power he had obtained
there, could work such
changes on the material world.
As a participant and dispenser of divine
influence,
he shows himself among human affairs a true connecting medium and
visible mes-
senger between heaven and earth, a man, therefore, not only permitted to enter the
sphere of poetry, but to dwell in the purest centre thereof, perhaps the most inspired
of all
teachers
since
the Apostles.
Unhappily or
happily, Luther's poetic
feeling
did not so much learn to express itself in
fit words, that take captive every ear, as in
fit
actions, wherein, truly under
still more
impressive
manifestations, the
spirit of
spheral melody resides and still audibly addresses us.
In his written poems, we find
little save that strength of one
' whose words,'
it has been said,
' were half-battles
' *
little of that
still harmony and blending
softness
of union which
is the last perfec-
tion of strength—less of
it than even his conduct manifested.
With words he had
not learned to make music—it was by deeds of love
or heroic valor that he spoke
freely.
Nevertheless, though in
imperfect
articulation, the same voice,
if we
listen
well,
is to be heard also in
his writings, in
his poems.
The one
entitled Ein
Fcste
Burg, universally regarded as tjie best, jars upon our ears
; yet there
is something in
it like the sound of Alpine avalanches, or the
first murmur of earthquakes, in the
very vastness of which dissonance a higher unison
is revealed to us.
Luther wrote
this
song
in
timeG
of
blackest
threatenings,
which,
however,
could
in no
sense
become a time of despair.
In
these tones, rugged
and broken
as they are, do we
hear the accents of that summoned man, who answered
his
friends' warning not to
enter Worms, in
this wise
:—
' Were
there
as many devils
in Worms
as these
tile
Diet
of Worms;
"I'll
go, be there as many devils
in
the city as
there be tiles on the
roofs."
The time
of its composition was
in
the year
1529, just
before
the
Diet
of Augsburg.
If not written in his tem-
porary refuge, the noble " Burg" or " Festung" of Coburg,
it must often have been sung there by him
;
and
it was sung, says Merle d'Aubigne, "during the Diet, not only at Augsburg, but in all the churches
of Saxony."
* This much-quoted phrase is from Richter.
It is reported as an expression of Melanchthon, look-
ing on Luther's picture, " Fitlmina erant singula verba tua."
xvi
INTRODUCTION.
roofs,
I would on
'; of him who, alone
in
that assemblage before
all emperors and
principalities and powers, spoke forth these final and forever memorable words,—
' It
is neither
safe nor prudent to do aught against conscience.
Till such time as either
by proofs from holy Scripture, or by fair reason or argument,
I have been
confuted
and convicted,
I
cannot and will
not
recant.
Here
I
stand—I
cannot do
other-
wise—God be my help. Amen.'
It
is evident enough
that
to this man
all popes,
cardinals, emperors, devils, all hosts and nations were but weak, weak as the
forest
with all its strong trees might be to the smallest spark of electric fire."
In a very different style of language, but in a like strain of eulogy, writes
Dr. Merle d'Aubigne, in the third volume of his History of the Reformation
:
" The church was no longer composed
of priests and monks;
it was now the
congregation of believers.
All were to take
part
in worship, and the chanting
of
the
clergy was
to
be succeeded by the psalmody of the
people.
Luther, accord-
ingly, in translating the psalms, thought of adapting them to be sung by the church.
Thus a taste for music was
diffused throughout
the
nation.
From
Luther's time,
the people sang
; the Bible inspired their songs.
Poetry received the same impulse.
In celebrating the praises of God, the people could not
confine themselves
to mere
translations of ancient anthems.
The souls of Luther and of several of his contem-
poraries, elevated by their faith to thoughts the most sublime, excited to enthusiasm
by the struggles and dangers by which the church at its birth was unceasingly threat-
ened, inspired by the poetic genius of the Old Testament and by the
faith
of the
New, ere long gave vent to their feelings in hymns, in which all that is most heavenly
in poetry and music was combined and blended.
Hence the revival, in the sixteenth
century, of hymns, such as in the first century used to cheer the martyrs in their suf-
ferings.
We have seen Luther, in 1523, employing
it
to
celebrate the martyrs
at
Brussels
;
other
children
of the Reformation
followed
his
footsteps
; hymns were
multiplied
; they spread
rapidly among
the people, and powerfully contributed to
rouse
it from sleep."
It
is not
difficult to come approximately at the order of composition
of Luther's hymns.
The earliest hymn-book of the Reformation—if not the
earliest of all printed hymn-books—was published at Wittenberg in 1524, and
contained eight hymns, four of them from the pen of Luther himself; of the
other four not less than three were by Paul Speratus, and one of these three,
the hymn Es
ist das Hcil, which caused Luther such delight when sung
beneath his window by a wanderer from Prussia.*

tributions to this little book were versions of Psalms—the xii, xiv, and cxxx
—and the fourth was that touching utterance
of personal
religious experi-
ence, Nttn freut euch, liebcn Christen gmeiii.
But the
critics can hardly
be mistaken in assigning as early a date to the ballad of the Martyrs of Brus-
sels.
Their martyrdom took place July
i, 1523, and the "New Song'" must
have
been
inspired
by the
story
as
it was
first brought
to
Wittenberg,
although
it is not found in print
until the Enchiridion, which
followed
the
Eight Hymns, later in the same year, from the press of Erfurt, and contained
fourteen of Luther's hymns beside the four already published.
In the hymn-book pubHshed in 1525 by the composer Walter, Luther's
friend, were
six more
of the
Luther hymns.
And
in
1526 appeared
the
" German Mass
and
Order
of Divine
Service,"
containing
" the German
Sanctus," a versification of Isaiah vi.
Of the remaining eleven, six appeared
first
in
the
successive
editions of Joseph
Klug's hymn-book, Wittenberg,
1535 and 1543.
It is appropriate to the commemorative character of the present edition
that in
it the hymns should be disposed in chronological order.
The TUNES which
are
here
printed with
the hymns of Luther are
of
those which were set to them
during
his
lifetime.
Some of them, like the
hymns to which they were set, are derived from
the more ancient hymnody
of the German and
Latin
churches.
Others,
as
the
tunes Vom Himmel
hoch, Ach
Gott vom Himmel, and
Christ tmser Hcrr ziim Jordan kam,
are conjectured to have been
originally secular
airs.
But that many of the
tunes that appeared simultaneously and
in connection with
Luther's hymns
were
original with
Luther
himself, there seems no good reason to doubt.
Luther's singular delight and proficiency in music are certified by a hundred
contemporary testimonies.
His enthusiasm
for
it overflows
in
his Letters
and
his
Table
Talk.
He
loved
to
surround
himself with
accomplished
musicians, with whom he would practise the
intricate motets of the masters
of that age
; and
his
critical remarks on their several styles are on
record.
At least one autograph document proves him
to have been a composer
of
melodies to his own words
: one may see, appended to von Winterfeld's fine
quarto edition of Luther's hymns (Leipzig, 1840) a fac-simile of the original
draft of Vater Unser, with a melody sketched upon a staff of
five lines, and
then cancelled, evidently by a hand practised in musical notation.
But
per-
xviii
INTRODUCTION.
haps the most direct testimony to his actual work as a composer
is found in
a
letter from
the composer John Walter, capellmeister to
the
Elector of
Saxony, written
in
his
old
age
for the
express purpose of embodying his
reminiscences of his illustrious friend as a church-musician.
" It
is to my certain knowledge," writes Walter, " that
that
holy man of God,
Luther, prophet and apostle to the German nation, took great delight in music, both
in choral and in figural composition.
With whom
I have passed many a delightful
hour in singing; and oftentimes have seen the dear man wax so happy and merry
in heart over the singing as that
it was well-nigh impossible to weary or content him
therewithal.
And his discourse concerning music was most noble.
" Some forty years ago, when he would set up the German Mass at Wittenberg,
he wrote
to the
Elector of Saxony and Duke
Johannsen,
of illustrious memory,
begging to invite to Wittenberg the old musician Conrad Rupff and myself, to con-
sult with him as to the character and
the proper notation of the Eight Tones; and
he finally himself decided to appropriate
the Eighth Tone
to
the
Epistle and the
Sixth Tone to the Gospel, speaking on this wise
: Our Lord Christ
is a good Friend,
and his words are full of love
;
so we will take the Sixth Tone for the Gospel.
And
since Saint Paul
is a very earnest apostle we will set the Eighth Tone to the Epistle.
So he himself made the notes over the Epistles, and
the Gospels, and the Words of
Institution of the true Body and Blood of Christ, and sung them over to me to get
my judgment thereon.
He kept me
three weeks long
at Wittenberg, to write out
the notes over some
of the Gospels and Epistles, until
the
first German Mass was
sung in the parish church.
And I must needs stay to hear
it, and
take with me a
copy of the Mass
to Torgau and present
it
to His Grace the Elector from Doctor
Luther.
" Furthermore, he gave
orders
to
re-establish
the
Vespers, which
in many
places were fallen into
disuse, with
short
plain
choral hymns
for the students and
boys
;
withal, that the charity-scholars, collecting their bread, should sing from door
to door Latin Hymns, Anthems and
Responses, appropriate
to the season.
It was
no satisfaction to him that the scholars should
sing
in the
streets nothing but Ger-
man songs.
.
.
.
The most profitable songs for the common multitude are the plain
psalms and hymns, both
Luther's and the
earlier ones
; but the
Latin songs
are
useful
for the
learned and
for students.
We
see, and hear, and clearly apprehend
how the Holy Ghost himself wrought not only in
the authors of the
Latin hymns,
but also in Luther, who in our time has had the chief part both
in writing the Ger-
man choral hymns, and in setting them to tunes;
as may be seen, among others
in
the German Sanctus {Jcsaia dan Prophcten
das geschah) how masterly and well he
has fitted
all the notes to the
text, according
to the just
accent and
concent.
At
the time,
I was moved by His Grace
to put the question how or where he had got

this composition, or this instruction
; whereupon
the dear man laughed
at my sim-
pHcity, and said
:
I learned this of the poet Virgil, who has the power so artfully to
adapt his verses and his words to the story he
is telling
;
in
like manner must Music
govern all its notes and melodies by the text." *
It seems superfluous to add to this testimony the word of Sleidan, the
nearly contemporary historian, who
says
expressly concerning
" Eiii
feste
Burg" that Luther made for
it
a tune
singularly suited to
the words, and
adapted to stir the heart.f
If ever there were hymn and tune that told their
own story of a common and simultaneous
origin, without need of confirma-
tion by external evidence,
it
is these.
To an extent
quite without parallel in the history of music, the power
of Luther's
tunes, as well as of his words, is manifest
after three
centuries,
over the masters of the art, as well as over the common
people.
Peculiarly
is this true of the great song Ein! feste Burg, which Heine not vainly pre-
dicted would again be heard in Europe in like manner as of old.
The com-
posers of the
sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries practised their elaborate
artifices upon
it.
The supreme genius of Sebastian Bach made
it the sub-
ject of
study.;}:
And
in our own times
it has been used with conspicuous
effect in Mendelssohn's Reformation Symphony, in an
overture by Raff, in
the noble Festouvcrture of Nicolai, and in Wagner's Kaisermarsch
; and
is
introduced
with
recurring
emphasis
in
Meyerbeer's
masterpiece
of The
Huguenots.
It
is needless
to
say
that
the
materials
of this
Birth-day Edition
of
Luther's Hymns and Tunes have been prepared in profusion by the diligence
of German
scholars.
But very thankful acknowledgments are
also due to
English
translators, who
have made
this work
possible
within
the
very
scanty time allotted to
it.
Full credit
is given
in the table

volume were peculiarly severe, inasmuch as the translation was to be printed
over against the original, and also under the music.
Not
ev'^en Mr. Richard

that
I have

the

for these

rest of the volume, is in so slight a degree the work of the
editor, is to add
the successive prefaces from the pen of Luther which accompanied

That
it
is good, and pleasing to God, for us to sing spiritual songs
is,
I
think, a truth whereof no Christian can be ignorant
;
since not only the example
of the prophets and kings of the Old Testament (who praised God with singing
and music, poesy and all kinds of stringed instruments) but also the like practice
of all Christendom from
the beginning, especially
in
respect to psalms, is well
known to every one: yea, St. Paul doth also appoint the same (i Cor xiv.) and
command the Colossians, in the third chapter, to sing spiritual songs and psalms
from the heart
unto
the
Lord,
that thereby the word of God and
Christian
doctrine be in every way furthered and practised.
Accordingly, to make a good beginning and to encourage others who can do
it better,
I have myself, with some others, put together a few hymns, in order to
bring into full play the blessed Gospel, which by God's grace hath again risen
that we may boast, as Moses doth in his song (Exodus xv.) that Christ is become
our praise and our
song,
and
that,
whether we
sing
or
speak, we may not
know anything save Christ our Saviour, as St. Paul saith (i Cor.
ii.).
These songs have been set in four
parts,
for no other reason than because I
wished to provide our young people (who both
will and ought to be instructed
in music and other sciences) with something whereby they might rid themselves
of amorous and carnal songs, and in their stead learn something wholesome, and
so apply themselves to what is good with pleasure, as becometh the young.
Beside this,
I am not of opinion that all sciences should be beaten down and
made to cease by the Gospel, as some
fanatics pretend
; but I would fain see all
the arts, and music in particular, used in the service of Him who hath given and
created them.
Therefore
I entreat every pious Christian
to give a favorable reception to
these hymns, and to help forward my undertaking, according as God hath given
him more
or
less
ability.
The world
is,
alas, not
so mindful and diligent to
train and teach our poor youth, but that we ought to be forward in promoting
the same.
God grant us his grace.
Amen.

SBtttembctg, Anno m.
d. xlii."
DR. MARTIN LUTHER TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.
St. Paul writes to
the Thessalonians, that they should not sorrow
for the
dead as others who have no hope, but should comfort one another with God's
word, as they who have a sure hope of life and of the resurrection of the dead.
For that they should sorrow who have no hope is not to be wondered at, nor
indeed are they to be blamed for it, since, being shut out from the faith of Christ,
they must either regard and love the present
life only, and be loth to lose
it, or
after this life look for everlasting death and the wrath of God
in
hell, and be
unwilling to go thither.
But we Christians who from
all this have been redeemed by the
precious
blood of the Son of God, should exercise and wont ourselves in faith to despise
death, to look on
it as a deep, sound, sweet
sleep, the
coffin no other than the
bosom
of our Lord
Christ,
or paradise, the grave nought
but a soft couch
of
rest;
as indeed it is in the sight of God, as he
saith in St. John, xi., "our friend
Lazarus sleepeth
; " Matthew ix., " the maid is not dead but sleepeth."
In
like manner also
St. Paul,
i Cor. xv., doth put out of sight the unlovely
aspect of death in our perishing body, and bring forward nought but the lovely
and delightsome view of
life, when he
saith
:
" It
is sown
in corruption
;
it
is
raised in incorruption
;
it
is sown
in dishonor (that is, in
a loathsome and
vile
form)
;
it is raised in glory
:
it is sown
in weakness
;
it
is raised in power
:
it
is
sown a natural body
;
it is raised a spiritual body."
Accordingly have we, in our churches, abolished, done away, and out-and-out
made an end of the popish horrors, such as wakes, masses for the soul, obsequies,
purgatory, and all other mummeries
for the dead, and will no longer have our
churches turned into wailing-places and houses of mourning, but, as the primitive
Fathers called them, " Cemeteries," that is, resting and sleeping places.
We
sing,
withal,
beside our dead
and over their
graves, no
dirges
nor
lamentations, but comforting songs of the forgiveness of sins, of rest, sleep, life
and resurrection of the departed believers, for the strengthening
of our
faith,
and the stirring up of the people to a true devotion.
For it is meet and right to give care and honor to the burial of the dead, in a

manner worthy of that blessed article of our creed, the resurrection of the dead,
and to the spite of that dreadful enemy, death, who doth so shamefully and con-
tinually prey upon us, in every horrid way and shape.
Accordingly, as we read, the holy patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph,
and the rest, kept their burials with great pomp, and ordered them with much
diligence
; and afterwards the kings of Judah held splendid ceremonials over the
dead, with costly incense of all manner of precious herbs, thereby to hide the
offense and shame of death, and acknowledge and
glorify the resurrection of the
dead, and so to comfort the weak in faith and the sorrowful.
In like manner, even down to this present, have Christians ever been wont to
do honorably by the bodies and the graves of the dead, decorating them, singing
beside them and
adorning them with monuments.
Of
all importance
is that
doctrine of the resurrection, that we be firmly grounded
therein
;
for
it
is our
lasting,
blessed,
eternal comfort and joy, against death,
hell, the
devil and
all
sorrow of heart.
As a good example of what should
be used
for this end, we have taken the
sweet music or melodies which under popish
rule are
in use at wakes, funerals
and masses for the dead, some of which we have printed
in this little book
; and
it is in our thought, as time shall serve, to add others to them, or have this done
by more competent hands.
But we have set other words
thereto, such as shall
adorn our doctrine of the resurrection, not that of purgatory with its pains and
expiations, whereby the dead may neither sleep nor rest.
The notes and melodies
are of great price
;
it were pity to let them perish
; but the words to them were
unchristian and uncouth, so let these perish.
It is just as in other matters they do greatly excel us, having splendid rites of
worship,
magnificent convents and abbeys
; but the preachings and doctrines
heard therein do
for
the most
part
serve
the devil and
dishonor God; who
nevertheless is Lord and God over
all the
earth, and should have of everything
the fairest, best and noblest.
Likewise have they
costly
shrines of gold and
silver, and images
set with
gems and jewels
; but within are dead men's bones, as foul and corrupt as in any
charnel-house.
So also have they costly vestments, chasubles, palliums, copes,
hoods, mitres, but what are they that be clothed therewithal? slow-bellies, evil
wolves, godless swine, persecuting and dishonoring the word of God.
Just in the same way have they much noble music, especially
in the abbeys
and parish churches, used to adorn most
vile, idolatrous words.
Wherefore we
have undressed
these
idolatrous,
lifeless, crazy words, stripping
off the noble
music, and putting it upon the living and holy word of God, wherewith to sing,
praise and honor the same, that so the beautiful ornament of music, brought back
to its right use, may serve its blessed Maker and his Christian people
;
so that he
xxiv
INTRODUCTION.
shall be praised and glorified, and that we by his holy word impressed upon the
heart with sweet songs, be builded up and
confirmed
in the
faith.
Hereunto
help us God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Yet is it not our purpose that these precise notes be sung in all the churches.
Let each church keep its own notes according to its book and use.
For I myself
do not listen with pleasure in cases where the notes to a hymn or a responsorium
have been changed, and it is sung amongst us in a different way from what I have
been used to from my youth.
The main point is the correcting of the words,
not of the music.
[Then follow selections of Scripture recommended as suitable for epitaphs.]

preface.
To
the Hj'mn-book
printed
at Wittenberg
bj' Joseph Klug, 1543.
There are certain who, by their additions to our hymns, have clearly shown
that they far excel me
in this matter, and may well be called my masters.
But
some, on the other hand, have added
little of value.
And inasmuch
as
I
see
that there is no limit to this perpetual amending by every one indiscriminately
according to his own liking, so that the earliest of our hymns are more perverted
the more they are printed,
I am fearful that it will fare with
this
little book as it
has ever fared with good books, that through tampering by incompetent hands
it may get to be so overlaid and spoiled that the good will be
lost out of
it, and
nothing be kept in use but the worthless.
We see in the first chapter of St. Luke that in the beginning every one wanted
to write a gospel, until among the multitude of gospels the true Gospel was well-
nigh lost.
So has it been with the works of St. Jerome and
St. Augustine, and
with many other books.
In
short, there will always be tares sown among the
wheat.
In order as
far
as may be
to avoid
this
evil,
I have once more revised this
book, and put our own hymns in order by themselves with name attached, which
formerly
I would not do for reputation's sake, but am now constrained to do by
necessity, lest strange and unsuitable songs come
to be
sold under our name.
After these, are arranged the others, such as we deem good and useful.
I beg and beseech all who prize God's pure word that henceforth without our
knowledge and consent no further additions or alterations be made
in
this book
of ours
; and that when it is amended without our knowledge,
it be fully under-
stood to be not our book published at Wittenberg.
Every man can
for himself
make his own hymn-book, and leave this of ours alone without additions
; as we
here
beg, beseech and
testify.
For we
like
to keep our coin up
to our own
standard, debarring no man from making
better
for
himself.
Now
let God's
name alone be praised, and our name not sought.
Amen.

INTRODUCTION.
lutDer's
jFourtfj
preface.
To Valentine
Bapst's Hymn-book,
Leipzig,
1545.
The xcvi Psalm saith
:
" Sing to the Lord a new song
; sing to the Lord, all
the earth."
The service of God in the old dispensation, under the law of Moses,
was hard and wearisome.
Many and divers sacrifices had men to offer, of all that
they possessed, both in house and in field, which the people, being idle and cov-
etous, did grudgingly or for some temporal advantage
;
as the prophet Malachi
saith, chap,
i.,
" who
is there even among you
that would shut the doors for
naught ? neither do ye kindle
fires on my altars for naught."
But where there
is such an idle and grudging heart there can be no singing, or at least no singing
of anything good.
Cheerful and merry must we be in heart and mind, when we
would
sing.
Therefore
hath God
suffered such idle and grudging service to
perish, as he saith further
:
" I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of Hosts,
neither will
I accept an offering at your hand
:
for from the rising of the sun even
to the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles
; and
in every place incense
shall be offered in my name and a pure offering
;
for my
name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of Hosts."
So that now in the New Testament there is a better service, whereof the psalm
speaketh
:
" Sing to the Lord a new song
; sing to the Lord all the earth."
For
God hath made our heart and mind joyful through
his dear Son whom he hath
given for us to redeem us from sin, death and the devil.
Who earnestly believes
this cannot but sing and speak thereof with joy and delight, that others also may
hear and come.
But whoso will not speak and sing thereof,
it
is a sign that he
doth not believe it, and doth not belong to the cheerful New Testament but to
the dull and joyless Old Testament.
Therefore it is well done on the part of the printers that they are diligent to
print good hymns, and make them agreeable to the people with all sorts of embel-
lishments, that they may be won to this joy in believing and gladly sing
of
it.
And inasmuch as this edition of Valtin Bapst [Pope]
is prepared
in
fine
style,
God grant that it may bring great hurt and damage to that Roman Bapst who by
his accursed, intolerable and abominable ordinances has brought nothing into the
world but wailing, mourning and misery.
Amen.
INTRODUCTION.
xxvii
I must give notice that the song which is sung at funerals,
" Nun
lasst uns den Lcib begraben,"
which bears my name is not mine, and my name is henceforth not to stand with
it.
Not that I reject it, for
I like
it very much, and it was made by a good poet,
Johannes Weis
'^ by name, only a little visionary about the Sacrament
; but
I will
not appropriate to myself another man's work.
Also in the Dc Profiuidis, read thus
:
Des muss dich
fiirchten jedermann.
Either by mistake or of purpose this is printed in most books
Des muss
sich
fiirchten jedermann.
Ut timearis.
The Hebrew reading
is
as
in Matthew
xv.
:
" In
vain do
they
fear me teaching doctrines of men."
See also Psalms xiv. and liii.
:
" They call
not on the Lord
; there feared they where no fear was."
That is, they may have
much show of humiliation and bowing and bending in worship where
I will have
no worship.
Accordingly
this
is the meaning
in this place
: Since forgiveness
of sins
is nowhere
else
to be found but only with thee, so must they let go all
idolatry, and come with a willing heart bowing and bending before thee, creeping
up to the cross, and have thee alone in honor, and take refuge
in thee, and serve
thee, as living by thy grace and not by their own righteousness, etc.

Speaketk.
Of all the joys that are on earth
Is none more dear nor higher worth,
Than what in my sweet songs is found
And instruments of various sound.
Where friends and comrades sing in tune,
All evil passions vanish soon
;
Hate, anger, envy, cannot stay.
All gloom and heartache melt away;
The lust of wealth, the cares that cling,
Are all forgotten while we sing.
Freely we take our joy herein,
For this sweet pleasure is no sin,
But pleaseth God far more, we know.
Than any joys the world can show
The Devil's work
it doth impede,
And hinders many a deadly deed.
Se fared
it with King Saul of old
;
When David struck his harp of gold.
So sweet and clear its tones rang out,
Saul's murderous thoughts were put to rout.
The heart grows
still when
I am heard,
And opens to God's Truth and Word;
So are we by Elisha taught,
Who on the harp the Spirit sought.
The best time of the year
is mine,
When all the little birds combine
To sing until the earth and air
Are filled with sweet sounds everywhere
;
And most the tender nightingale
Makes joyful every wood and dale.
Singing her love-song o'er and o'er.
For which we thank her evermore.
But yet more thanks are due from us
To the dear Lord who made her thus,
A singer apt to touch the heart,
Mistress of all my dearest art.
To God she sings by night and day.
Unwearied, praising Him alway
;
Him I, too, laud in every song.
To whom all thanks and praise belong.

Dear Christians, one and all rejoice,
With exultation springing,
And with united heart and voice
And holy rapture singing,
Proclaim the wonders God hath done,
How his right arm the victory won
;
Right dearly it hath cost him.
Fast bound in Satan's chains
I
lay,
Death brooded darkly o'er me
Sin was my torment night and day,
Therein my mother bore me.
Deeper and deeper still I fell,
Life was become a living hell.
So firmly sin possessed me.
My good works could avail me naught,
For they with sin were stained
;
Free-will against God's judgment fought.
And dead to good remained.
Grief drove me to despair, and I
Had nothing left me but to die.
To hell
I fast was sinking.
God saw, in his eternal grace,
My sorrow out of measure
;
He thought upon his tenderness
To save was his good pleasure.
He turn'd to me a Father's heart-
Not small the cost—to heal my smart
He gave his best and dearest.
He spake to his beloved Son
'Tis time to take compassion
;
Then go, bright jewel of my crown,
And bring to man salvation
;
From sin and sorrow set him free.
Slay bitter death for him, that he
May live with thee forever.

CHRISTIANS, ONE AND ALL REJOICE.

6 The Son delighted to obey,
And born of Virgin mother,
Awhile on this low earth did stay
That he might be my brother.
His mighty power he hidden bore,
A servant's form like mine he wore,
To bind the devil captive.
7 To me he spake
:
cling fast to me,
Thou'lt win a triumph worthy
;
I wholly give myself for thee,
I strive and wrestle for thee
;
For I am thine, thou mine also
;
And where I am thou art.
The foe
Shall never more divide us.
8 For he shall shed my precious blood.
Me of my life bereaving
;
All this I suffer for thy good
;
Be steadfast and believing.
My life from death the day shall win,
My righteousness shall bear thy sin,
So art thou blest forever.
9 Now to my Father I depart.
From earth to heaven ascending
Thence heavenly wisdom to impart.
The Holy Spirit sending.
He
shall in trouble comfort thee,
Teach thee to know and follow me,
And to the truth conduct thee.
10 What I have done and taught, do thou
To do and teach endeavor
;
So shall my kingdom flourish now.
And God be praised forever.
Take heed lest men with base alloy
The heavenly treasure should destroy.
This counsel I bequeath tliee.

1 Look down, O Lord, from heaven behold,
And let thy pity waken
!
How few the flock within thy fold.
Neglected and forsaken
!
Almost thou'lt seek for faith in vain,
And those who should thy truth maintain
Tliy Word from us have taken.
2 With frauds which they themselves invent
Thy truth they have confounded
;
Their hearts are not with one consent
On thy pure doctrine grounded
;
And, whilst they gleam with outward show.
They lead thy people to and fro,
In error's maze astounded.
3 God surely will uproot all those
With vain deceits who store us.
With haughty tongue who God oppose,
And say, " Who'll stand before us ?
By right or might we will prevail
What we determine cannot fail,
For who can lord
it o'er us ?"
4 For this, saith God,
I will arise,
These wolves my flock are rending
;
I've heard my people's bitter sighs
To heaven my throne ascending
Now will
I up, and set at rest
Each weary soul by fraud opprest.
The poor with might defending.
5 The silver seven times tried is pure
From all adulteration
;
So, through God's word, shall men endure
Each trial and temptation
:
Its worth gleams brighter through the cross.
And, purified from human dross.
It shines through every nation.
6 Thy truth thou wilt preserve, O Lord,
From this vile generation
;
Make us to lean upon thy word,
With calm
anticipation.
The wicked walk on every side
When, 'mid thy flock, the vile abide
In power and exaltation.

The Lord looked down from his high tower
On all mankind below him,
To see
if any owned his power,
And truly sought to know him
Who all their understanding bent
To search his holy Word, intent
To do his will in earnest.
But none there was who walked with God,
For all aside had slidden,
Delusive paths of folly trod,
And followed lusts forbidden
;
Not one there was who practiced good.
And yet they deemed, in haughty mood.
Their deeds must surely please him.
How long, by folly blindly led,
Will ye oppress the needy.
And eat my people up like bread ?
So fierce are ye, and greedy
In God they put no trust at all,
Nor will on him in trouble call,
But be their own providers.
Therefore their heart is never still,
A falling leaf dismays them
;
God
is with him who doth his will,
Who tmsts him and obeys Him
;
But ye the poor man's hope despise.
And laugh at him, e'en v.'hen he cries,
That God
is his sure comfort.
Who shall to Israel's outcast race
From Zion bring salvation
?
God will himself at length show grace,
And loose the captive nation
;
That will he do by Christ their King
Let Jacob then be glad and sing,
And Israel be joyful.

Out of the deep I cry to thee
;
O Lord God, hear my crying
:
Incline thy gracious ear to me,
With prayer to thee applying.
For if thou fix thy searching eye
On all sin and iniquity,
Who, Lord, can stand before thee ?
But love and grace with thee prevail,
O God, our sins forgiving
The holiest deeds can naught avail
Of all before thee living.
Before thee none can boast him clear
Therefore must each thy judgment
fear,
And live on thy compassion.
For this, my hope in God shall rest.
Naught building on my merit
My heart confides, of him possest,
His goodness stays my spirit.
His precious word assureth me
;
My solace, my sure rock
is he,
Whereon my soul abideth.
And though I wait the livelong night
And
till the morn returneth,
My heart undoubting trusts his might
Nor in impatience mourneth.
Born of his Spirit, Israel
In the right way thus fareth well.
And on his God reposeth.
What though our sins are manifold ?
Supreme his mercy reigneth
;
No limit can his hand withhold.
Where evil most obtaineth.
He the good Shepherd
is alone,
Who Israel will redeem and own,
Forgiving all transgression.

I By help of God
I fain would tell
A new and wondrous story,
And sing a marvel that befell
To his great praise and glory.
At Brussels in the Netherlands
He hath his banner lifted,
To show his wonders by the hands
Of two youths, highly gifted
With rich and heavenly graces.
2 One of these youths was called John,
And Henry was the other
;
Rich in the grace of God was one,
A Christian true his brother.
For God's dear Word they shed their blood,
And from the world departed
Like bold and pious sons of God
;
Faithful and lion-hearted,
They won the crown of
martyrs.
3 The old Arch-fiend did them immure.
To terrify them seeking
;
They bade them God's dear \\^ord abjure,
And fain would stop their speaking.
From Louvain many Sophists came.
Deep versed in human learning,
God's Spirit foiled them at their game
Their pride to folly turning.
They could not but be losers.
4 They spake them fair, they spake them foul,
Their sharp devices trying.
Like rocks stood firm each brave young soul
The Sophists' art defying.
The enemy waxed fierce in hate.
And for their life-blood thirsted
;
He fumed and chafed that one so great
Should by two babes be worsted,
And straightway sought to burn them.

5 Their monkish garb from them they take,
And gown of ordination
;
The youths a cheerful Amen spake,
And showed no hesitation.
They thanked their God that by his aid
They now had been denuded
Of Satan's mock and masquerade,
Whereby he had deluded
The world with false pretences.
6 Thus by the power of grace they were
True priests of Gods own making,
Who offered up themselves e'en there,
Christ's holy orders taking
;
Dead to the world, they cast aside
Hypocrisy's sour leaven,
That penitent and justified
They might go clean to heaven,
And leave all monkish follies.
7 They then were told that they must read
A note which was dictated
;
They straightway wrote their fate and creed,
And not one jot abated.
Now mark their heresy
!
" We must
In God be firm believers
In mortal men not put our trust,
For they are all deceivers ;"
For this they must be burned
!
8 Two fires were lit
; the youths were brought.
But all were seized with wonder
To see them set the flames at naught.
And stood as struck with thunder.
With joy they came in sight of
all.
And sang aloud God's praises
;
The Sophists' courage waxdd small
Before such wondrous traces
Of God's almighty finger.
9 The scandal they repent, and would
Right gladly gloss
it over
;
They dare not boast their deed of blood.
But seek the stain to cover.

All praise to Jesus' hallowed name
Who of virgin pure became
True man for us
! The angels sing
As the glad news to earth they bring.
Hallelujah

For a manger leaves his throne.
Disguised in our poor flesh and blood
See now the everlasting Good.
Hallelujah!

3 He whom the world could not inwrap
Yonder lies in Mary's lap
He is become an infant small,
Who by his might upholdeth

Hallelujah
4 Th' eternal Light, come down from heaven,
Hath to us new sunshine given

It shineth in the midst of

And maketh us the sons of light.
Hallelujah
5 The Father's Son, God everblest.
In the world became a guest
He leads us from this vale of

And makes us in his kingdom heirs.
Hallelujah
6 He came to earth so mean and poor,
Man to pity and restore.
And make us rich in heaven above.
Equal with angels through his love.
Hallelujah

All this he did
to show his grace:
To our poor and sinful race
;,
For this let Christendom adore
And praise his name for evermore.

Thus came Death upon us
all,
Bound the captive world in thrall,
Held us 'neath his dread dominion.
Hallelujah
I
3 Jesus Christ, God's only Son,
To our low state descending,
All our sins away hath done
Death's power forever ending.
Ruined all his right and claim
Left him nothing but the name,
For his sting is lost forever.
Hallelujah
4 Strange and dreadful was the fray,
When Death and Life contended ;
But 'twas Life that won the day,
And Death's dark sway was ended.
Holy Scripture plainly saith.
Death is swallowed up of Death,
Put to scorn and led in triumph.
Hallelujah
5
This, the Paschal Lamb, the Christ,
Whom God so freely gave us.
On the cross is sacrificed
In flames of love to save us.
On our door the blood-mark
;—Faith
Holds
it in the face of Death.
The Destroyer can not harm us.
Hallelujah
!
6 Therefore let us keep the feast
With heartfelt exultation
God to shine on us
is pleased,
The Sun of our salvation.
On our hearts, with heavenly grace,
Beams the brightness of his face.
And the night of sin has Vanished.
Hallelujah
7 Eat th' unleavened bread to-day,
And drink the paschal chalice
;
From God's pure word put away
The leaven of guile and malice.
Christ alone our souls will feed
He is meat and drink indeed.
Faith no other life desireth.
Hallelujah
!

1 Come, God Creator, Holy Ghost,
And visit thou these souls of men
;
Fill them with graces, as thou dost,
Thy creatures make pure again.
2 For Cwnforter thy name we call.
Sweet gift of God most high above,
A holy unction to us all
O Fount of
life. Fire of
love,
3 Our minds illumine and refresh,
Deep in our hearts let love burn bright
Thou know'st the weakness of our flesh
;
And strengthen us with thy might.
4 Thou with thy wondrous sevenfold gifts
The finger art of God's right hand
The Father's word thou sendest
swift
On tongues of
fire to each land.
5
Drive far from us our wily foe
Grant us thy blessdd peace within.
That in thy footsteps we may go,
And shun the dark ways of
sin.
6 Teach us the Father well to know.
Likewise his only Son our Lord,
Thyself to us believing show,
Spirit of both, aye adored.
COME, GOD

irregularities of the German versification may be explained

No other God besides me own

On my great mercy venture thee.
With all thy heart love thou me.

5 Give to thy parents honor due,
Be dutiful and loving too
And help them when their strength decays ;
So shalt thou have length of days.
Have mercy, Lord.
6
Kill thou not out of evil will,
Nor hate, nor render
ill for
ill
Be patient and of gentle mood,
And to thy foe do thou good.
Have mercy, Lord.
7 Be faithful to thy marriage vows.
Thy heart give only to thy spouse
Keep thy life pure, and lest thou sin
Keep thyself with discipline.
Have mercy. Lord.
8
Steal not ; oppressive acts abhor
Nor wring their life-blood from the poor
But open wide thy loving hand
To all the poor in the land.
Have mercy. Lord.
9 Bear not false witness, nor belie
Thy neighbor by foul calumny ;
Defend his innocence from blame.
With charity hide his shame.
Have mercy. Lord.
10 Thy neighbor's wife desire thou not.
His house, nor aught that he hath got
But wish that his such good may be
As thy heart doth wish for thee.
Have mercy. Lord.
1
God these commandments gave, therein
To show thee, son of man, thy sin.
And make thee also well perceive
How man for God ought to live.
Have mercy, Lord.
12 Help us. Lord Jesus Christ, for we
A Mediator have in thee
;
Without thy help our works so vain
Merit naught but endless pain.
Have mercy. Lord.

For the sick who would be mended

Those whose heav^-laden breast
Groans with sin, and is seeking rest.

Art thou well

Avoid this board.
Else thou reapest an
ill reward.
7 Lo
! he saith himself, "Ye weary,
Come to me, and
I will cheer ye ;"
Needless were the leech's skill
To the souls that be strong and well.
8 Couldst thou earn thine own salvation.
Useless were my death and passion
;
Wilt thou thine own helper be
?
No meet table
is this for thee.
9
If thou this believest truly.
And confession makest duly.
Thou a welcome guest art here.
This rich banquet thy soul shall cheer.
lo Sweet henceforth shall be thy labor.
Thou shalt truly love thy neighbor
So shall he both taste and see
What thy Saviour hath done in thee.

Thou only, Lord, canst do
it
It moves thy tender heart to see
Our great sin and misery.
Holy and gracious God
!
Holy and mighty God
!
Holy and all merciful Saviour
!
Thou eternal God
Let not hell dismay us
With its deep and burning flood.
Kyrie eleison.
3
Into hell's fierce agony
Sin doth headlong drive us
:
Where shall we for succor flee,
Who, O, who will hide us
?
Thou only, blessed Saviour.
Thy precious blood was shed to win
Peace and pardon for our sin.
Holy and gracious God
!
Holy and mighty God
Holy and all-merciful Saviour
!
Let us not, we pray,
From the true faith's comfort
Fall in our last need away.
Kyrie eleison.

'Tis Christ that wrought
this work for me,
The faithful Saviour
Whom thou hast made mine eyes to see
By thy favor.
In him I behold my
life,
My help in need and dying.
3 Him thou hast unto all set forth,
Their great salvation,
And to his kingdom called the earth
Every nation.
By thy daar, health-giving word.
In every land resounding.
4 He is the Health and blessed Light
Of lands benighted
By him are they who dwelt in night
Fed and
lighted.
While his Israel's hope he
is,
Their joy, reward and glory.

We all believe in one true God,
Maker of the earth and heaven,
The Father who to us the power
To become his sons hath given.
He will us at all times nourish,
Soul and body, guard us, guide us,
'Mid all harms will keep and cherish,
That no
ill shall ever betide us.
He watches o'er us day and night
All things are governed by his might.
And we believe in Jesus Christ,
Lord and Son of God confessed.
From everlasting days with God,
In like power and glory blessed.
By the Holy Ghost conceived,
Born of Mar}', virgin mother.
That to lost men who believed
He should Saviour be and brother
;
Was crucified, and from the grave.
Through God,
is risen, strong
to save.
3 We in the Holy Ghost believe,
\\'ho with Son and Father reigneth,
One true God.
He, the Comforter,
Feeble souls with gifts sustaineth.
All his saints, in every nation.
With one heart this faith receiving.
From all sin obtain salvation.
From the dust of death reviving.
These sorrows past, there waits in store
For us, the life for evermore.

I Had God not come, may Israel say,
Had God not come to aid us,
Our enemies on tliat sad day
Would surely have dismayed us
;
A remnant now, and handful small.
Held in contempt and scorn by all
Who cruelly oppress us.
Their furious wrath, did God permit,
Would surely have consumed us.
And in the deep and yawning pit
With life and limb entombed us
;
Like men o'er whom dark waters roll,
The streams had gone e'en o'er our soul.
And mightily o'erwhelmed us.
Thanks be to God, who from the pit
Snatched us, when
it was gaping
;
Our souls, like birds that break the net.
To the blue skies escaping
;
The snare
is broken—we are free
The Lord our helper praised be.
The God of earth and heaven.

The
genuine te.xt is here given, and the English version is conformed to

Strong tower and refuge is our God,
Right goodly shield and weapon
;
He helps us free in every need,
That hath us now o'ertaken.
The old evil foe,
Means us deadly woe
;
Deep guile and great might
Are his dread arms in fight
On earth is not his equal.
With our own might we nothing can,
Soon are we lost and fallen
;
But for us fights the righteous man,
Whom God himself hath callen.
Ask ye, Who is this ?
Jesus Christ it is,
Our sole King and Lord,
As God of Hosts adored
He holds the field forever.
Though earth all full of devils were.
Wide roaring to devour us
;
Yet fear we no such grievous fear,
They shall not overpower us.
This world's prince may
still
Scowl fierce as he will,
He can harm us none,
He's judged
; the deed is done
;
One
little word can fell him.
His Word they
s;ill shall
let abide,
And little thank have for
it
Through all the fight he's on our side
With his good gifts and Spirit.
Take they then our life,
Wealth, fame, child and wife,
Let these all be gone.
No triumph have they won.
The kingdom ours remaineth.

1 From heaven above to earth I come,
To bear good news to every home
;
Glad tidings of great joy I bring,
Whereof I now will say and sing,
2 To you, this night,
is born a child
Of Mary, chosen Mother mild
;
This tender child of lowly birth.
Shall be the joy of all your earth.
3
'Tis Christ our God, who far on high
Had heard your sad and bitter cry
;
Himself will 3-our salvation be,
Himself from sin will make you free.
4 He brings those blessings long ago
Prepared by God for all below
;
That in his heavenly kingdom blest
You may with us forever rest.
5 These are the tokens ye shall mark.
The swaddling-clothes and manger dark
;
There shall ye find the young child laid.
By whom the heavens and earth were made.
FROM HEAVEN ABOVE
TO EARTH
I
COME.

6 Now let us all, with gladsome cheer,
Follow the shepherds, and draw near
To see this wondrous gift of God,
Who hath his own dear Son bestowed.
7
Give heed, my heart,
lift up thine eyes
!
What is it
in yon manger lies ?
Who is this child, so young and fair ?
The blessed Christ-child lieth there
!
8 Welcome to earth, thou noble guest,
Through whom e'en wicked men are blest
Thou com'st to share our misery.
What can we render, Lord, to thee
!
9 Ah, Lord, who hast created all,
How hast thou made thee weak and small.
To lie upon the coarse dry grass.
The food of humble ox and ass.
10 And were the world ten times as wide.
With gold and jewels beautified.
It would be far too small to be
A little cradle. Lord, for thee.
11 Thy silk and velvet are coarse hay.
Thy swaddling bands the mean array,
With which even thou, a King so great,
Art clad as with a robe of state.
12 Thus hath it pleased thee to make plain
The truth to us, poor fools and vain.
That this world's honor, wealth and might
Are naught and worthless in thy sight.
13 Ah, dearest Jesus, holy child,
Make thee a bed,
soft, undefiled.
Here in my poor heart's inmost shrine.
That I may evermore be thine.
14 My heart for ver}' joy doth leap,
My lips no more can silence keep,
I too must sing, with joyful tongue.
That sweetest ancient cradle song
:
15 Glory to God in highest heaven,
Who unto man his Son hath given.
While angels sing, with pious mirth,
A glad New Year to all the e-rth.

Dear is to me the holy Maid,
I never can forget her
For glorious things of her are said
;
Than life I love her better
:
So dear and good,
That
if I should
Afflicted be,
It moves not me
;
For she my soul will ravish
With constancy and love's pure fire,
And with her bounty lavish
Fulfil my heart's desire.
She wears a crown of purest gold,
Twelve shining stars attend her
;
Her raiment, glorious to behold.
Surpasses far in splendor
The sun at noon
;
Upon the moon
She stands, the Bride
Of him who died
:
Sore travail
is upon her
She bringeth forth a noble Son
Whom all the world doth honor
;
She bows before his throne.
Thereat the Dragon raged, and stood
W'ith open mouth before her
;
But vain was his attempt, for God
His buckler broad threw o'er her.
Up to his throne
He caught his Son,
But left the foe
To rage below.
The mother, sore
afflicted,
Alone into the desert fled.
There by her God protected.
By her true Father fed.

3 Thy kingdom come
!
Thine let
it be
In time, and through eternity
!
O let thy Holy Spirit dwell
With us, to rule and guide us well
From Satan's mighty power and rage
Preserve thy Church from age to age.
4 Thy will be done on earth, O Lord,
As where in heaven thou art adored
!
Patience in time of grief bestow,
Thee to obey through weal and woe
;
Our sinful flesh and blood control
That thwart thy will within the soul.
5
Give us this day our daily bread,
Let us be duly clothed and fed,
And keep thou from our homes afar
Famine and pestilence and war,
That we may live in godly peace,
Unvexed by cares and avarice.
6 Forgive our sins, O Lord, that they
No more may vex us, day by day,
As we forgive their trespasses
Who unto us have done amiss
;
Thus let us dwell in charity,
And serve each other willingly.
7
Into temptation lead us not
And when the foe doth war and plot
Against our souls on every hand.
Then, armed with faith, O may we stand
Against him as a valiant host,
Through comfort of the Holy Ghost.
8
Deliver us from evil. Lord
!
The days are dark and foes abroad
;
Redeem us from eternal death
;
And when we yield our dying breath.
Console us, grant us calm release.
And take our souls to thee in peace.
9 Amen
!
that
is, So let it be
!
Strengthen our faith and trust in thee.
That we may doubt not, but believe
That what we ask we shall receive
;
Thus in thy name and at thy word
\N'e say Amen, now hear us, Lord
!

Christ Jesus, thy beloved Son.
2 Lord Jesus Christ, thy power make known,
For thou art Lord of lords alone.
Shield thy poor Christendom, that we
May evermore sing praise to thee.
3 God, Holy Ghost, our joy thou art

Give to thy flock on earth one heart.
Stand by us in our latest need.
And us from death to glory lead.

To Jordan came our Lord the Christ,
To do God's pleasure wiUing,
And there was by Saint John baptized,
All righteousness fuliiUing
;
There did he consecrate a bath
To wash away transgression,
And quench the bitterness of death
By his own blood and passion
;
He would a new life give us.
So hear ye
all, and well perceive
What God doth call baptism,
And what a Christian should believe
Who error shuns and schism
:
Thai we should water use, the Lord
Declareth
it his pleasure
;
Not simple water, but the Word
And Spirit without measure
;
He is the true Baptizer.
TO JORDAN CAME OUR LORD THE
CHRIST.

3 To show us this, he hath his word
With signs and symbols given
;
On Jordan's banks was plainly heard
The Father's voice from heaven
:
" This is my well-beloved Son,
In whom ray soul delighteth
;
Hear him."
Yea, hear him every one
Whom he himself inviteth,
Hear and obey his teaching.
4 In tender manhood Jesus straight
To holy Jordan wendeth
;
The Holy Ghost from heaven's gate
In dovelike shape descendeth
;
That thus the truth be not denied,
Nor should our faith e'er waver,
That the Three Persons all preside
At Baptism's holy laver,
And dwell with the believer.
5 Thus Jesus his disciples sent
Go, teach ye every nation,
That lost in sin they must repent.
And flee from condemnation
:
He that believes and is baptized,
Obtains a mighty blessing
;
A new-born man, no more he dies.
Eternal life possessing,
A joyful heir of heaven.
6 Who in this mercy hath not faith,.
Nor aught therein discerneth.
Is yet in sin, condemned to> deathy
And fire that ever bumeth
;
His holiness avails him not,
Nor aught which he is doing
;
His inborn sin brings all to naught.
And maketh sure his ruin
;
Himself he cannot succor.
7 The eye of sense alone
is dim.
And nothing sees but water ;
Faith sees Christ Jesus, and in him
The lamb ordained for slaughter ;
She sees the cleansing fountain red
With the dear blood of Jesus,
Which from the sins inherited
From fallen Adam frees us,
And from our own misdoings.

1 Why, Herod, unrelenting foe,
Doth the Lord's coming move thee so ?
He doth no earthly kingdom seek
Who brings his kingdom to the meek.
2 Led by the star, the wise men find
The Light that lightens all mankind
;
The threefold presents which they bring
Declare him God, and Man, and King.
3
In Jordan's sacred waters stood
The meek and heavenly Lamb of God,
And he who did no sin, thereby
Cleansed us from all iniquity!
4 And now a miracle was done
Six waterpots stood there of stone
;
Christ spake the word with power divine.
The water reddened into wine.
5
All honor unto Christ be paid.
Pure offspring of the holy maid.
With Father and with Holy Ghost,
Till time in endless time be lost.
