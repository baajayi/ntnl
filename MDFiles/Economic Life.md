A Social Statement on Economic Life
Sufficient, Sustainable Livelihood for All
A Social Statement on:
Adopted by a more than two-thirds majority vote by the sixth Churchwide Assembly of  the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, meeting in Denver, Colorado, August 16-22, 1999.

conomic life pervades our lives—the work we do, the income we receive,
how much we consume and save, what we value, and how we view one another.
An economy (oikonomia or “management of the household”) is meant to meet people’s
material needs. The current market-based economy does that to an amazing degree;
many are prospering as never before. At the same time, others continue to lack what
they need for basic subsistence. Out of deep concern for those affected adversely, we of
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America here assess economic life today in light of
the moral imperative to seek sufficient, sustainable livelihood for all.
To an unprecedented degree, today’s market economy has become global in scope,
intensity, and impact. Common brand names appear throughout the world. Many
companies based in the United States generate most of their revenues and profits
abroad. Daily foreign exchange trading has increased a hundredfold over the past
quarter century. Billions of dollars of capital can flow out of one country and into
another with a few computer keystrokes. This economic globalization has brought new
kinds of businesses, opportunities, and a better life for many. It also has resulted in
increasing misery for others. Intensive global competition can force a company to
relocate if it is to survive—generating jobs elsewhere, while leaving behind many
workers who lose their jobs. Sudden shifts in globalized capital and financial markets
can dramatically affect the economic wellbeing of millions of people, for good or for ill.
Human beings are responsible and accountable for economic life, but people often feel
powerless in the face of what occurs. Market-based thought and practices dominate our
world today in ways that seem to eclipse other economic, social, political, and religious
perspectives. To many people, the global market economy feels like a free-running
system that is reordering the world with few external checks or little accountability to
values other than profit. Economic mandates often demand sacrifices from those least
able to afford them. When any economic system and its effects are accepted without
Sufficient, Sustainable Livelihood for All
question—when it becomes a “god-like” power reigning over people, communities, and
creation—then we face a central issue of faith.
The Church confesses
If the economic arena becomes a reigning power for us, the question arises: in what or
whom shall we place our trust and hope? The First Commandment is clear: “You shall
have no other gods before me” (Exodus 20:3). Or as Jesus said, “You cannot serve God
and wealth” (Matthew 6:24c, Luke 16:13). To place our trust in something other than
God is the essence of sin. It disrupts our relationships with God, one another, and the
rest of creation, resulting in injustices and exploitation: “For from the least to the
greatest of them, everyone is greedy for unjust gain” (Jeremiah 6:13).
As a church we confess that we are in bondage to sin and submit too readily to the idols
and injustices of economic life. We often rely on wealth and material goods more than
God and close ourselves off from the needs of others. Too uncritically we accept
assumptions, policies, and practices that do not serve the good of all.
Our primary and lasting identity, trust, and hope are rooted in the God we know in Jesus
Christ. Baptized into Christ’s life, death, and resurrection, we receive a new identity and
freedom, rather than being defined and held captive by economic success or failure. In
the gathered community of Christ’s Body, the Church, we hear the Word and partake of
the Supper, a foretaste of the fullness of life promised by Jesus, “the bread of life” (John
6:35). Through the cross of Christ, God forgives our sin and frees us from bondage to
false gods. Faith in Christ fulfills the First Commandment. We are called to love the
neighbor and be stewards in economic life, which, distorted by sin, is still God’s good
creation.
God who “executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food to the hungry” (Psalm
146:7) is revealed in Jesus, whose mission was “to bring good news to the poor . . .
release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to
proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor” (Luke 4: 18-19). The kingdom of God he
proclaimed became real through concrete acts of justice: feeding people, freeing them
from various forms of bondage, embracing those excluded by the systems of his day,
and calling his followers to a life of faithfulness to God.
God’s reign is not a new system, a set of prescriptive laws, or a plan of action that
depends on what we do. Nor is it a spiritual realm removed from this world. In Jesus
Christ, God’s reign intersects earthly life, transforming us and how we view the systems
of this world. Our faith in God provides a vantage point for critiquing any and every
system of this world, all of which fall short of what God intends. Human impoverish-
ment, excessive accumulation and consumerism driven by greed, gross economic

disparities, and the degradation of nature are incompatible with this reign of God.
Through human decisions and actions, God is at work in economic life. Economic life is
intended to be a means through which God’s purposes for humankind and creation are
to be served. When this does not occur, as a church we cannot remain silent because of
who and whose we are.
Our obligation and ongoing tensions
Based on this vantage point of faith, “sufficient, sustainable livelihood for all” is a
benchmark for affirming, opposing, and seeking changes in economic life. Because of
sin we fall short of these obligations in this world, but we live in light of God’s prom-
ised future that ultimately there will be no hunger and injustice. This promise makes us
restless with less than what God intends for the world. In economic matters, this draws
attention to:
•
the scope of God’s concern “for all,”
•
the means by which life is sustained “livelihood,”
•
what is needed “sufficiency,” and
•
a long-term perspective “sustainability.”
These criteria often are in tension with one another. What benefits people in one area,
sector, or country may harm those elsewhere. What is sufficient in one context is not in
another. What is economically sufficient is not necessarily sustainable. There are
difficult and complex trade-offs and ambiguities in the dynamic processes of economic
life. As believers, we are both impelled by God’s promises and confronted with the
practical realities of economic life. We often must choose among competing claims,
conscious of our incomplete knowledge, of the sin that clouds all human judgments and
actions, and of the grace and forgiveness given by Christ.
Economic assumptions can conflict with what we as a church confess. Who
we are
in Christ places us in tension with priorities given to money, con
sumption, competition, and profit in our economic system.
•
While autonomy and self-sufficiency are highly valued in our society, as
people of faith we confess that we depend on God and are interdependent
with one another. Through these relationships we are nurtured, sustained,
and held accountable.
•
While succeeding or making something of themselves is what matters to
many in economic life, we confess that in Christ we are freely justified by
grace through faith rather than by what we do.
Sufficient, Sustainable Livelihood for All
•
While a market economy emphasizes what individuals want and are willing
and able to buy, as people of faith we realize that what human beings want is
not necessarily what they need for the sake of life.
•
While a market economy assumes people will act to maximize their own
interests, we acknowledge that what is in our interest must be placed in the
context of what is good for the neighbor.
•
While competitiveness is key to economic success, we recognize that intense
competitiveness can destroy relationships and work against the reconciliation
and cooperation God desires among people.
•
While economic reasoning assumes that resources are scarce relative to
people’s wants, we affirm that God promises a world where there is enough
for everyone, if only we would learn how to use and share what God has
given for the sake of all.
•
While economic growth often is considered an unconditional good, we insist
that such growth must be evaluated by its direct, indirect, short-term, and
long-term effects on the wellbeing of all creation and people, especially
those who are poor.
When we pray in the Lord’s Prayer, “Give us this day our daily bread,” we place
ourselves in tension with economic assumptions of our society. Rather than being self-
sufficient, we need and depend on what God gives or provides through people, prac-
tices, and systems. “Daily bread” is not earned by efforts of individuals alone, but is
made possible through a variety of relationships and institutions.1 God gives in ways that
expand our notions of who “us” includes, from people close at hand to those around the
globe. In stark contrast to those who seek unchecked accumulation and profit, our
attention is drawn to those who are desperate for what will sustain their lives for just this
day.
For all: especially those living in poverty
“For all” refers to the whole household of God—all people and creation throughout the
world. We should assess economic activities in terms of how they affect “all,” espe-
cially people living in poverty.
We tend to view economic life by how it affects us personally. The cross of Christ
challenges Christians to view this arena through the experience of those of us who are
impoverished, suffering, broken, betrayed, left out, without hope. Through those who
are “despised” and “held of no account” (Isaiah 53:3) we see the crucified Christ
(Matthew 25:31-46), through whom God’s righteousness and justice are revealed. The
A Social Statement on Economic Life
power of God’s suffering, self-giving love transforms and challenges the Church to
stand with all who are overlooked for the sake of economic progress or greed. Confes-
sion of faith ought to flow into acts of justice for the sake of the most vulnerable.
Outrage over the plight of people living in poverty is a theme throughout the Bible. The
poor are those who live precariously between subsistence and utter deprivation. It is not
poor people them selves who are the problem, but their lack of access to the basic
necessities of life. Without such, they cannot maintain their human dignity. Strong
themes in Scripture indicate that people are poor because of circumstances that have
afflicted them (such as “aliens, orphans, widows”), or because of the greed and unjust
practices of those who “trample on the poor” (Amos 5:11). The basic contrast is
between the weak and the greedy. The psalmist decries that “the wicked draw the sword
and bend their bows to bring down the poor and needy” (Psalm 37:14). The prophet
rails against those “who write oppressive statutes to turn aside the needy from justice”
(Isaiah 10:1-2). Their moral problem is that they have followed greed rather than God.
As a result, the poor lose their basic productive resource (their land), and fall into cycles
of indebtedness. Poverty is a problem of the whole human community, not only of those
who are poor or vulnerable.
In relation to those who are poor, Martin Luther’s insights into the meaning of the
commandments against killing, stealing, and coveting are sobering. We violate “you
shall not kill” when we do not help and support others to meet their basic needs. As
Luther explained, “If you see anyone suffer hunger and do not feed [them], you have let
[them] starve.”2  “To steal” can include “taking advantage of our neighbor in any sort of
dealing that results in loss to him [or her] . . . wherever business is transacted and money
is exchanged for goods or labor.”3 “You shall not covet” means “God does not wish you
to deprive your neighbor of anything that is [theirs], letting [them] suffer loss while you
gratify your greed.”4 Related Hebraic laws called for leaving produce in the fields for
the poor (Deuteronomy 24:21), a periodic cancellation of debts (Deuteronomy 15:1),
and a jubilee year in which property was to be redistributed or restored to those who had
lost it, so that they might again have a means of livelihood (Leviticus 25).
Today, well over a billion people in the world are deprived of what they need to meet
their basic needs. Far more lack clean water, adequate sanitation, housing, or health
services. They use whatever limited options are available to them in their daily struggle
to survive. Thousands die daily. Millions pursue economic activities that are part of the
underground or informal economy, and are not counted in economic statistics. Children
often have no option but to labor under unjust conditions to provide for themselves and
their families. Political struggles, militarism, and warfare add to this travesty, displacing
masses of people from their homes.5 In many of the poorest countries, incomes continue
to decline, and people subsist on less and less. Although most of the impoverished live
in developing countries, where their numbers continue to grow at alarming rates, many
millions are in the industrial ized countries. Millions of poor people live in communities
Sufficient, Sustainable Livelihood for All
in the United States and the Caribbean where the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America is present.
Developing countries that have opened their economies to global markets have gener-
ally reduced poverty over time more than those that have not, but the terms of trade
often work to the disadvan tage of developing countries. Seeking more just exchanges
“for all” through investment and trade is a significant challenge. The danger is that less
developed parts of the world, or less powerful groups within a country, will be exploited
or excluded from participation in global markets.
When a developing country becomes heavily indebted, the poorest are usually the most
adversely affected. A huge share of a country’s income must be used to pay off debt,
which may have been incurred unjustly or under corrupt rulers. Structural adjustment
programs to pay off debt typically divert funds from much needed educational, health,
and environmental efforts, and from infrastruc tures for economic development.
God stands in judgment of those in authority who fall short of their responsibility, and is
moved with compassion to deliver the impoverished from all that oppresses them:
“Give justice to the weak and the orphan; maintain the right of the lowly and the
destitute” (Psalm 82:3). The rich are expected to use wealth to benefit their neighbors
who live in poverty here and throughout the world.
In light of these realities, we commit ourselves as a church 6 and urge members to:
•
address creatively and courageously the complex causes of poverty;
•
provide opportunities for dialogue, learning, and strategizing among people
of different economic situations and from different regions who are harmed
by global economic changes;
•
give more to relieve conditions of poverty, and invest more in initiatives to
reduce poverty.
We call for:
•
scrutiny of how specific policies and practices affect people and nations that
are the poorest, and changes to make policies of economic growth, trade, and
investment more beneficial to those who are poor;
•
efforts to increase the participation of low-income people in political and
civic life, and citizen vigilance and action that challenges governments and
other sectors when they become captive to narrow economic interests that do
not represent the good of all;
•
shifts throughout the world from military expenditures to purposes that serve
the needs of low-income people;
A Social Statement on Economic Life
•
support for family planning and enhanced opportunities for women so that
population pressures might be eased; 7
•
reduction of overwhelming international debt burdens in ways that do not
impose further deprivations on the poor, and cancellation of some or all debt
where severe indebtedness immobilizes a country’s economy;
•
investments, loan funds, hiring practices, skill training, and funding of
micro-enterprises and other community development projects that can
em-
power low-income people economically.
Livelihood: vocation, work, and human dignity
Vocation: Our calling from God begins in the waters of Baptism and is lived out in a
wide array of settings and relationships. Freed through the Gospel, we are to serve
others through arenas of responsibility such as family, work, and community life.
Although we continue to be ensnared in the ambiguities and sin of this world, our
vocation is to seek what is good for people and the rest of creation in ways that glorify
God and anticipate God’s promised future.
“Livelihood” designates our means of subsistence or how we are supported economi-
cally. This occurs through paid jobs, self-employment, business ownership, and accu-
mulated wealth, as well as through support of family, community networks, and
government assistance.
Strong families, neighborhoods, and schools should support and help prepare persons
for livelihood. Churches, businesses, financial institutions, government, and civil society
also play key roles. Through these relationships people can be enabled and obligated to
pursue their livelihoods as they are able. When these infrastructures for livelihood are
absent, weak, or threatened (as they are for many today), people are more likely to be
impoverished materially, emotionally, or spiritually.
Through these relationships and structures, individuals can learn important virtues, such
as:
•
trust, accountability, and fidelity in relationships;
•
discipline, honesty, diligence, and responsibility in work;
•
frugality, prudence, and temperance in the use of resources;
•
compassion and justice toward other people and the rest of creation.
These virtues, along with perspectives and skills acquired through education and
training, make it more likely that individuals will be able to flourish in their livelihood.
We commit ourselves as a church and urge members to:
Sufficient, Sustainable Livelihood for All
•
develop God-given capacities and provide stable, holistic, loving develop
ment of children and youth through families, neighborhoods, congregations,
and other institutions;
•
support and encourage one another as we live out our vocation in ways that
serve the neighbor and contribute to family and community vitality;
•
pray and act to provide livelihood for ourselves and others through the
institutions of our day, trusting in God’s providential care for all.
We call for:
•
policies that promote stable families, strong schools, and safe neighbor
hoods;
•
addressing the barriers individuals face in preparing for and sustaining a
livelihood (such as lack of education, transportation, child care, and health
care).
Work: In Genesis, work is to be a means through which basic needs might be met, as
human beings “till and keep” the garden in which God has placed them (Genesis 2:15).
Work is seen not as an end in itself, but as a means for sustaining humans and the rest of
creation. Due to sin, the work God gives to humans also becomes toil and anguish
(Genesis 3:17,19). Injustice often deprives people of the fruits of their work (Proverbs
13:23), which benefits others instead.
God calls people to use their freedom and responsibility, their capacities and know-how
to participate productively in God’s world. As stewards of what God has entrusted to us,
we should use available resources to generate jobs for the livelihood of more people, as
well as to create capital for the growth needed to meet basic needs. Wealth should serve
or benefit others so that they also might live productively.
What matters in many jobs today, rather than a sense of vocation, is the satisfaction of
wants or desires that the pay from work makes possible. Work becomes a means toward
increased consumerism. Many also feel a constant sense of being judged, having to
measure up according to an unrelenting bottom line of productivity or profit. We are
freed from such economic captivity by the forgiveness, new life, and dignity that is ours
in Christ.
Competitive economic forces, as well as changing technologies and consumer demands,
significantly affect the kinds of jobs available and the nature of work. Increased produc-
tivity and technological innovation continue to make some jobs obsolete, while creating
others. A growing proportion of jobs are part-time, temporary, or contractual, without
the longevity and security assumed in the past. Workers in the United States increas-
ingly produce services rather than tangible goods. Many people choose to be self-
A Social Statement on Economic Life
employed. A large number lose their jobs when companies merge, downsize, or move
to areas with lower labor costs.
Job transitions can be enriching, but also painful. Feeling invested in one’s job as a
calling or being able to count on a future livelihood can be difficult when work is
continually in flux. Many workers feel treated as if they are dispensable. Amid these
changes, our faith reminds us that our security and livelihood rest ultimately on God.
Our hope is grounded in God’s promise—that people “shall long enjoy the work of their
hands” (Isaiah 65:21). This gives us courage to ask why changes are occurring, to
challenge forces of greed and injustice when they deny some people what they need to
live, and, when necessary, to seek new possibilities for livelihood.
Therefore, we commit ourselves as a church and urge members to:
•
deliberate together about the challenges people face in their work;
•
counsel and support those who are unemployed, underemployed, and under
going job transitions;
•
provide skill and language enhancement training that will enable the most
vulnerable (including new immigrants) to become better prepared for jobs.
We call for:
•
public and private sector partnerships to create jobs and job retention pro
grams;
•
national economic policies that support and advance the goal of low unem
ployment.
Human dignity: Human beings are created “in God’s image” (Genesis 1:27) as social
beings whose dignity, worth, and value are conferred by God. Although our identity
does not depend on what we do, through our work we should be able to express this
God-given dignity as persons of integrity, worth, and meaning. Yet work does not
constitute the whole of our life. When we are viewed and treated only as workers, we
tend to be exploited.
Employers have a responsibility to treat employees with dignity and respect. This
should be reflected in employees’ remuneration, benefits, work conditions, job security,
and ongoing job training. Employees have a responsibility to work to the best of their
potential in a reliable and responsible manner. This includes work habits, attitudes
toward employers and co-workers, and a willingness to adapt and prepare for new work
situations. No one should be coerced to work under conditions that violate their dignity
or freedom, jeopardize their health or safety, result in neglect of their family’s
wellbeing, or provide unjust compensation for their labor.
Sufficient, Sustainable Livelihood for All
Our God-given dignity in community means that we are to participate actively in
decisions that impact our lives, rather than only passively accept decisions others make
for us. People should be involved in decision making that directly affects their work.
They should also be free to determine their lives independent of particular jobs. Public
policy can provide economic and other conditions that protect human freedom and
dignity in relation to work.
Power disparities and competing interests are present in most employment situations.
Employers need competent, committed workers, but this does not necessarily presume
respect for the personal lives and needs of individual workers. Individual workers
depend on the organization for employment as their means of livelihood, but this does
not necessarily presume respect for the organization’s interest and goals. Management
and employees move toward justice as they seek cooperative ways of negotiating these
interests when they conflict. Because employees often are vulnerable and lack power in
such negotiations, they may need to organize in their quest for human dignity and
justice. When this occurs, accurate information and fair tactics are expected of all parties
involved.
We commit ourselves as a church to:
•
hire without discriminating on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, age, disabilities,
sexual orientation, or genetic factors;
•
compensate all people we call or employ at an amount sufficient for them to live in
dignity;
•
provide adequate pension and health benefits, safe and healthy work conditions,
sufficient periods   of rest, vacation, and sabbatical, and family-friendly work schedules;
•
cultivate participatory workplaces, support the right of employees to organize for
the sake of better working conditions and to engage in collective bargaining, and refrain
from inten tionally undercutting union organizing activities, or from permanently
replacing striking workers.
We call for:
•
other employers to engage in similar practices;
•
government enforcement of regulations against discrimination, exploitative
work conditions and labor practices (including child labor), and for the right
of workers to organize and bargain collectively;
•
public policies that ensure adequate social security, unemployment insur
ance, and health care coverage;
•
a minimum wage level that balances employees’ need for sufficient income
with what would be significant negative effects on overall employment;
•
tax credits and other means of supplementing the insufficient income of low-

paid workers in order to move them out of poverty.
Sufficiency: enough, but not too much
“Sufficiency” means adequate access to income and other resources that enable people
to meet their basic needs, including nutrition, clothing, housing, health care, personal
development, and participa tion in community with dignity. God has created a world of
sufficiency for all, providing us daily and abundantly with all the necessities of life.8 In
many countries, the problem is not the lack of resources, but how they are shared,
distributed, and made accessible within society. Justice seeks fairness in how goods,
services, income, and wealth are allocated among people so that they can acquire what
they need to live.
Human need and the right to ownership often are in tension with each other. The
biblical understand ing of stewardship is that what we have does not ultimately belong
to us. We are called to be stewards of what God has given for the sake of all. This
stewardship includes holding economic, political, and social processes and institutions
responsible for producing and distributing what is needed for sufficiency for all. Private
property is affirmed insofar as it serves as a useful, yet imperfect means to meet the
basic needs of individuals, households, and communities.
Government is intended to serve God’s purposes by limiting or countering narrow
economic interests and promoting the common good. Paying taxes to enable govern-
ment to carry out these and other purposes is an appropriate expression of our steward-
ship in society, rather than something to be avoided. Government often falls short of
these responsibilities. Its policies can harm the common good and especially the most
vulnerable in society. Governing leaders are to be held accountable to God’s purposes:
“May [they] judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice. . . . May
[they] defend the cause of the poor of the people” (Psalm 72:2).
The lack of material sufficiency for some within the human community is itself a
spiritual problem. “How does God’s love abide in anyone who has the world’s goods
and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses to help?” (1 John. 3:17). Sin disrupts
our bonds with and our sense of responsibility for one another. We live separated from
others on the basis of income and wealth, and resent what others have. Huge disparities
in income and wealth, such as those we face in this country, threaten the integrity of the
human community.
Those who are rich and those who are poor are called into relationships of generosity
from which each can benefit. Within the Church, those in need and those with abun-
dance are brought together in Christ. On this basis and in the face of disparities in the
church of his day, Paul calls for “a fair balance between your present abundance and
their need, so that their abundance may be for your need.” In so doing, “the one who
Sufficient, Sustainable Livelihood for All
had much did not have too much, and the one who had little did not have too little.” (2
Corinthians 8:9, 13-15).
God’s mandate is clear. “Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice
. . . and to break every yoke? Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and bring the
homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked to cover them, and not to hide
yourself from your own kin?” (Isaiah 58:6-7). God’s lavish, justifying grace frees us
from self-serving preoccupations and calls us to a life of mutual generosity as we relate
to all who are our neighbors. Faith becomes active through personal relationships, direct
assistance, and wider policy changes in society.
Not enough: In the United States, tens of millions of people live in poverty, although
many refuse to think of themselves as “poor.” Some make daily choices as to which
necessities they will have to live without. Many work part- or full-time, but on that
basis, are still unable to lift their families out of poverty. Others are physically or
mentally unable to work. Many lack the family, educational, and community support
important for making good choices in their lives. Although those living in poverty are
particularly visible in cities, their more hidden reality in suburban, small town, and rural
areas can be just as painful. A greater proportion of people of color live in conditions of
poverty. The poor are disproportionately women with their children.9 Systemic racism
and sexism continue to be evident in the incidence of poverty.
In light of these realities, we commit ourselves as a church and urge members to:
•
provide counsel, food, clothing, shelter, and money for people in need, in
ways that respect their dignity;
•
develop mutual, face-to-face, empowering relationships between people who
have enough and people living in poverty, especially through congregational
and synodical partnerships;
•
advocate for public and private policies that effectively address the causes of
poverty;
•
generously support organizations and community-based efforts that enable
low-income people to obtain more sufficient, sustainable livelihoods;
•
continue working to eradicate racism and sexism.
We call for:
•
government to provide adequate income assistance and related services for
citizens, documented immigrants, and refugees who are unable to provide for
their livelihood through employment;
•
adequate, consistent public funding for the various low-income services non-
profit organiza tions provide for the common good of all;
•
scrutiny to ensure that new ways of providing low-income people with
A Social Statement on Economic Life
assistance and services (such as through the private sector) do not sacrifice
the most vulnerable for the sake of economic efficiency and profit;
•
correction of regressive tax systems, so that people are taxed progressively in
relation to their ability to pay;
•
opposition to lotteries and other state-sponsored gambling because of how
these regressive means of raising state revenues adversely affect those who
are poor.10
Too much: Because most of us in the United States have far more than we need, we can
easily fall into bondage to what we have. We then become like the young man Jesus
encountered, whose bondage to his possessions kept him from following Jesus (Mat-
thew 19:16-22; Mark 10:17-22; Luke 18:18-25).
We consume goods and use services to meet our needs. To increase consumption and
expand sales, businesses stimulate ever new wants. Rather than human need shaping
consumption, advertising and media promotion both shape and expand wants. Our very
being becomes expressed through what we have or desire to possess. When consuming
to meet basic needs turns into consumerism as an end in itself, we face a serious crisis of
faith.
Endless accumulation of possessions and pursuit of wealth can become our god as we
yearn for a life without limits. “Ah, you who join house to house, who add field to field,
until there is room for no one but you” (Isaiah 5:8). Many look to material possessions
and money as the means for participating in the “fullness of life,” and thus become ever
more dependent on economic transactions. But Jesus asks, “What does it profit them if
they gain the whole world, but lose or forfeit themselves?” (Luke 9:25).
In the United States, people’s worth and value tend to be measured by the size of their
income and wealth. If judged by their multimillion dollar compensations, top corporate
officers and sports superstars would seem to be the most highly valued in our society.
Enormous disparities between their compensations and the average wages of workers
are scandalous.
The economic power of large transnational corporations continues to grow, making
some of them larger than many national economies. Along with this financial strength
comes an inordinate potential to influence political decisions, local and regional
economies, and democratic processes in society. The power they wield, enhanced
through mergers and buyouts, can have positive effects, but it can also hold others
captive to transnational corporate interests. The global community must continue to
seek effective ways to hold these and other powerful economic actors more accountable
for the sake of sufficient, sustainable livelihood for all.
In light of these realities, we commit ourselves as a church and urge members to:
Sufficient, Sustainable Livelihood for All
•
examine how we are in bondage to our possessions and can be freed to be
faithful stewards of them;
•
serious and ongoing consideration in our families and congregations of how
to resist the allure of consumerism and live lives less oriented toward the
accumulation of goods and financial assets;
•
educate one another, beginning with the young, on how to deal responsibly
with money, credit, and spending within one’s means;
•
give generously of our wealth (for example, through tithing and planned
giving), especially for purposes that serve the needs of others.
We call for:
•
corporate policies that lessen the disparities between compensations of top
corporate executives and that of the workers throughout an organization;
•
corporate governance that is accountable for the effects of a company’s
practices on workers, communities, and the environment here and throughout
the world;
•
scrutiny of the tax breaks, subsidies, and incentives many companies receive,
to assure that they serve the common good;
•
enforcement of laws to prevent the exercise of inordinate market power by
large corporations;
•
appropriate government regulatory reform so that governments can monitor
private sector practices more effectively and efficiently in an ever-changing
global economy.
Sustainability: of the environment, agriculture, and low-
income communities
“Sustainability” is the capacity of natural and social systems to survive and thrive
together over the long term. What is sufficient in providing for people’s wants often is
in tension with what can be sustained over time. Sustainability has implications for how
we evaluate economic activity in terms of its ongoing effects on the wellbeing of both
nature and human communities. Economic life should help sustain humans and the rest
of creation—now and in the future.
Efforts to provide a sufficient livelihood must be sustainable economically. Individuals
and families should not borrow more than they are able to pay back and still meet their
future needs. Governments should not finance their spending by excessive borrowing or
money creation that reduces national income and production, and threatens the liveli-

hood of future generations. Tax rates and government regulations must not be so
burdensome as to stifle the production of the very goods and services people need to
live.
“The earth is the Lord’s and all that is in it, the world, and those who live in it” (Psalm
24:1). As God created, so God also sustains: “When you send forth your spirit . . . you
renew the face of the ground” (Psalm 104:30). God makes a covenant with Noah, his
descendants, and every living creature that they will not be destroyed (Genesis 9:8-17).
In God’s promise of “new heavens and a new earth . . . they shall build houses and
inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit” (Isaiah 65:17, 21). The
vantage point of the kingdom of God motivates us to focus on more than short-term
gains. Humans, called to be stewards of God’s creation, are to respect the integrity and
limits of the earth and its resources.
Sustaining the environment: The growth of economic activity during the twentieth
century, and the industrialization and consumerism that fueled it, radically changed the
relationship between humans and the earth. Too often the earth has been treated as a
waste receptacle and a limitless storehouse of raw materials to be used up for the sake of
economic growth, rather than as a finite, fragile ecological system upon which human
and all other life depends.
Instead of being stewards who care for the long-term wellbeing of creation, we confess
that we have depleted non-renewable resources, eroded topsoil, and polluted the air,
ground, and water. Without appropriate environmental care, economic growth cannot be
sustained. Caring for creation means that economic processes should respect environ-
mental limits. “When we act interdependently and in solidarity with creation, we do
justice. We serve and keep the earth, trusting its bounty can be sufficient for all, and
sustainable.” 11
We commit ourselves as a church and urge members to:
•
use less, re-use, recycle, and restore natural resources;
•
plan for careful land use of church property, and receive and manage gifts of
land and real estate in sustainable ways.
We call for:
•
appropriate policies and regulations that help reverse environmental destruc
tion;
•
planning that accounts for the impact of regional growth on communities and
ecosystems;
•
ending subsidies for economic activities that use up non-renewable natural
resources;
Sufficient, Sustainable Livelihood for All
•
companies to pay more fully for the wider social and environmental costs of
what they produce; the development and use of more energy-efficient
technologies.
Sustaining agriculture: Agriculture is basic to the survival and security of people
throughout the world. Through the calling of agriculture, farmers produce the grain for
our daily bread and the rest of our food supply. Without a bountiful and low-cost food
supply, most Americans would not enjoy the livelihood they do. Farmers face the
challenge of producing this food in ways that contribute to the regeneration of the land
and the vitality of rural communities. At the same time, society as a whole must address
the high levels of risk farmers face and the low prices they often receive. Changing
agricultural policies and the growing power of large agribusiness corporations make this
even more challenging.
We commit ourselves as a church and urge members to:
•
pray for and support those who farm the land;
•
pursue new ways for consumers to partner with small farmers in sharing the
risks and yields of farming.
We call for:
•
changes to assure that farmers will receive a greater proportion of the retail
food dollar;
•
adequate prices for agricultural products so that farmers can be compensated
fairly for their labor and production costs;
•
sustainable agricultural practices that protect and restore the regenerative
capacities of the land, rather than practices that deplete the land (for ex
ample,
by measuring productivity only by short-term agricultural yields);
•
more just work conditions for farm workers, especially immigrants, and
opportunities for them to acquire their own land.
Sustainable development of low-income communities: In many low-income communi-
ties, disinvestment and neglect have taken their toll. In contrast to this are examples of
sustainable community economic development that take into account the overall health
and welfare of people, the environment, and the local economy. Such an approach
creates jobs, prepares people for work, generates income that is re-circulated several
times in the community, and sustains and renews environmental resources, all for the
sake of a community’s long-term viability.
Instead of a top-down approach focused on a community’s deprivation and its lack of
economic growth, effective community development draws upon its assets and empha-
A Social Statement on Economic Life
sizes quality and diverse production. Effective policies build and enhance a
community’s social relationships, values, and institutions, which together can further
economic development. Local residents determine the future of their community by
initiating, supporting, and sustaining new projects. Their capacities, skills, and assets
help shape the vision and plan for the community.
Through broad-based community organizing people can be mobilized to address
economic and other issues that directly affect them. Government and the private sector
also must invest in health, education, and infrastructures necessary for sustainable
development. When people and resources are connected in ways that multiply their
power and effectiveness, this will help bring about productive results and meaningful
participation in community and economic life.
Therefore, we commit ourselves as a church and urge members to:
•
learn about, participate in, and provide financial support for community
economic development and organizing strategies that enhance the current
and future wellbeing of communities and the environment;
•
support community development corporations and locally-owned or pro
ducer-owned cooperatives;
•
integrate social values into our investment decisions, and invest more in
socially responsible companies and funds that sustain businesses as well as
workers, consumers, the environment, and low-income communities.
We call for:
•
support of the above strategies by governments, financial institutions, and
the wider society;
•
alternatives to gambling as a means of community economic development;
•
grants and low-interest loans that enable small companies and farms to get
started, develop, and expand in order to provide livelihood for more people
in low-income communities.
In conclusion, a vision renewed
Pursuing policies and practices that will lead to “sufficient, sustainable livelihood for
all” is such a formidable challenge that to many it seems unrealistic or not worth the
effort. The Church as an employer, property owner, consumer, investor, and community
of believers can be as caught up in the reigning economic assumptions as the rest of
society. But despite the Church’s failings, through the Word and the sacraments, we are
forgiven, renewed, and nourished. At the Table, we together receive the same bread and
drink of the same cup. What we receive is sufficient; it does sustain us. We are strength-
Sufficient, Sustainable Livelihood for All
ened to persist in the struggle for justice as we look forward to the coming of God’s
kingdom in all its fullness.
We are sent forth into the world to bear witness to God’s promised reign. The world is
the whole household of God that economic life is intended to serve. The Spirit of God
expands our vision and transforms our priorities. We realize that we do not eat alone;
everyone needs to eat. The multitudes present around God’s global table become our
neighbors rather than competitors or strangers. Empowered by God, we continue to act,
pray, and hope that through economic life there truly will be sufficient, sustainable
livelihood for all.
