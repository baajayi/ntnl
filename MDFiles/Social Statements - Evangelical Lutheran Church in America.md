Social Statements
“This church shall develop social statements … that will guide the life of this church as an institution
and inform the conscience of its members in the spirit of Christian liberty.” (ELCA social statement,
“The Church in Society: A Lutheran Perspective (https://elca.org/Faith/Faith-and-Society/Social-
Statements/Church-in-Society)”)
ELCA social statements are teaching and policy documents that provide broad frameworks to assist
us in thinking about and discussing social issues in the context of faith and life. They are meant to
help communities and individuals with moral formation, discernment and thoughtful engagement with
current social issues as we participate in God’s work in the world. Social statements also set policy for
the ELCA and guide its advocacy and work as a publicly engaged church. They result from an
extensive process of participation and deliberation and are adopted by a two-thirds vote of an ELCA
churchwide assembly.
The description and procedures for developing and adopting these social teaching and policy
documents are established by “Policies and Procedures of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America for Addressing Social Concerns.” (https://www.elca.org/en/Faith/Faith-and-
Society/Addressing-Social-Concerns?_ga=1.147733054.825230763.1464708174)
