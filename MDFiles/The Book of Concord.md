Preface to the Christian Book of Concord
1] To the Readers, one and all, of these Writings of ours, we, the Electors, Princes, 
and Deputies of the Holy Roman Empire in Germany, adherents of the Augsburg 
Confession, who have subscribed our names to the same, announce and declare, ac-
cording to the dignity and rank of each one, our devotion, friendship, and greeting, 
combined with willing service.
The Issues
2] It is a remarkable favor of Almighty God that in these last times and in this 
old age of the world He has willed, according to His unspeakable love, forbear-
ance, and mercy, that after the darkness of papistical superstitions the light of His 
Gospel and Word, through which alone we receive true salvation, should arise and 
shine clearly and purely in Germany, our most beloved fatherland. And on this 
account, indeed, a brief and succinct confession was prepared from the Word of 
God, and the most holy writings of the Prophets and Apostles, and at the Diet of 
Augsburg, in the year 1530, was offered, by our most godly ancestors, in the Ger-
man and Latin languages, to the Emperor Charles V, of excellent memory, and laid 
before [all] the deputies of the Empire, and finally, being circulated publicly among 
all men professing Christian doctrine, and thus in the entire world, was diffused 
everywhere, and began to be current in the mouths and speech of all.
3] Afterwards many churches and schools embraced and defended this Confession 
as a symbol of the present time in regard to the chief articles of faith, especially 
those involved in controversy with the Romanists and various corruptions of 
the heavenly doctrine [sects], and with perpetual agreement have appealed to it 
without any controversy and doubt. The doctrine comprised in it, which they knew 
both to be supported by firm testimonies of Scripture, and to be approved by the 
ancient and accepted symbols, they have also constantly judged to be the only and 
perpetual consensus of the truly believing Church, which was formerly defended 
against manifold heresies and errors, and is now repeated.
4] But it can be unknown to no one that, immediately after Dr. Martin Luther, that 
most distinguished hero, endowed with most eminent piety, was removed from 
human affairs, Germany, our dear fatherland, experienced most perilous times 
and most severe agitations. In these difficulties, and in the sad distraction of a 
government before flourishing and well regulated, the enemy of mortals cunning-
ly labored to scatter in the churches and schools the seeds of false doctrine and 
dissensions, to excite divisions combined with offense, and by these arts of his to 
The Lutheran Confessions

corrupt the purity of the heavenly doctrine, to sever the bond of Christian love 
and godly agreement, and to hinder and retard to a greater degree the course of 
the most holy Gospel. It, is also known to all in what manner the enemies of the 
heavenly doctrine seized this opportunity to disparage our churches and schools, 
to find covering for their errors, to draw alarmed and erring consciences away 
from the purity of the Gospel-doctrine, in order to render them more compliant 
in bearing and tolerating the yoke of the papal slavery, and in embracing also other 
corruptions conflicting with God’s Word.
5] To us, indeed, nothing could happen, either more agreeable, or which, we would 
judge, should be sought for more earnestly and prayerfully from Almighty God, 
than that both our churches and our schools should have persevered in the pure 
doctrine of God’s Word and in that longed-for and godly unanimity of mind, and, 
as was the case while Luther was still alive, that they should have been regulated 
according to the rule of the divine Word, and handed down to posterity in a godly 
and excellent way. We notice, however, that, just as in the times of the Apostles, 
into those churches in which they themselves had planted the Gospel of Christ 
corruptions were introduced by false brethren, so, on account of our sins and the 
looseness of these times, this has been allowed by an angry God against our church-
es also.
6] Wherefore, mindful of our duty, which, we know, has been divinely enjoined 
upon us, we think that we ought diligently to apply ourselves to the labor of 
attacking in our provinces and realms the false teachings which have been dissemi-
nated there, and are gradually insinuating themselves, as it were, into the intimate 
acquaintance and familiarity of men, and that we should see to it that the subjects 
in our government may persevere in the straight way of godliness and in the truth 
of the heavenly doctrine, acknowledged and thus far retained and defended, and 
not be suffered to be led away from it. In this matter, indeed, partly our most wor-
thy predecessors, partly we ourselves, were eagerly at work, when, in the year of 
Christ 1558, on the occasion of the Diet which was then being held by the Electors 
at Frankfort on the Main, the resolution was adopted by a unanimous vote that 
a special, general assembly should be held, where in a thorough, but nevertheless 
amicable manner there might be a conference among us concerning such matters 
as are maliciously charged, by our adversaries, against [us and] our churches and 
schools.

The Naumburg Conference of 1561
7] And, indeed, after these deliberations our predecessors, of godly and excellent 
memory, together with some of us, assembled at Naumburg in Thuringia. On 
that occasion we took in hand the Augsburg Confession, offered to the Emperor 
Charles V in the great assembly of the Empire at Augsburg in the year 1530, and 
mentioned by us several times previously, and to that godly confession, built upon 
solid testimonies of the truth, which cannot be shaken, and is expressed in the 
Word of God, we all subscribed with one mind. In this way, of course, we meant 
to provide for the interests of posterity, and to enable and urge them, as far as we 
could, to avoid false doctrines conflicting with God’s Word. This we did also with 
the design that, both with his Imperial Majesty, our most clement lord, and also 
universally among all, there might be a permanent testimony that it has never been 
our intention to wish to defend or spread any new and strange dogma, but that 
we desired, God aiding us, to constantly support and retain the truth which we 
professed at Augsburg in the year 1530. We were also led to entertain a not uncer-
tain hope that in this way not only those who oppose the pure evangelical doctrine 
would abstain from fabricated charges and accusations, but also other good and 
well-disposed men would be attracted by this renewed and repeated confession of 
ours, and, with greater zeal and care, would seek and investigate the truth of the 
heavenly doctrine, which alone is our guide to salvation, and, out of regard for 
the salvation of the soul and their eternal happiness, would assent to it, all further 
controversies and disputations being rejected.
The Naumburg Conference Failed
8] But, not without agitation of mind, we were informed that this declaration of 
ours and that repetition of a godly confession had too little weight with our adver-
saries, and that neither we nor our churches were delivered from the most grievous 
slanders, arising from prejudice, which they had circulated against us among the 
people; also, that those things which we have done, with the best intention and 
purpose, have been received by the adversaries of the true religion in such a way as 
though we were so uncertain concerning our [confession of faith and] religion, and 
so often had transfused it from one formula to another that it was no longer clear 
to us or our theologians what is the Confession once offered to the Emperor at 
Augsburg. These fictions of the adversaries have deterred and alienated many good 
men from our churches, schools, doctrine, faith, and confession. To these disad-
vantages there is also added that, under the pretext of the Augsburg Confession, 
the teaching conflicting with the institution of the Holy Supper of the body and 
The Lutheran Confessions
4
blood of Christ and also other corruptions were introduced here and there into the 
churches and schools.
9] When some godly men, lovers of peace and harmony, besides also learned theo-
logians, had noticed all these things, they judged that these slanders and the dis-
sensions in religion which were constantly increasing more and more, could not be 
better met than if the controverted articles would be thoroughly and accurately set 
forth and explained from the Word of God, the false teachings would be rejected 
and condemned, and, on the other hard, the truth divinely delivered be clearly and 
lucidly presented; because they were convinced that by this method both silence 
could be imposed upon the adversaries, and the more simple and godly be shown 
a sure way and plan as to how they should act in these dissensions, and, aided by 
divine grace, could also in the future avoid corruptions of doctrine.
10] In the beginning, therefore, the theologians communicated to one another 
certain writings concerning this subject, sufficiently comprehensive, and derived 
from the Word of God, in which they showed clearly and skilfully how these 
controversies, which were not without offense to the churches, could be put to rest 
and removed from sight without any loss to the truth of the Gospel; for the result 
would be that the opportunities and pretexts sought for slander would be cut off 
and removed from the adversaries. Finally they took up and accurately and in the 
fear of God pondered and explained the controverted articles, and accordingly 
in a special writing stated comprehensively in what way and by what method the 
dissensions which had arisen could be settled in a right and godly manner.
11] Having been informed of this godly purpose of the theologians, we have not 
only approved it, but have also judged that it ought to be promoted by us with 
great earnestness and zeal, in view of the office and duty divinely committed to us.
The Torgau Conference of 1576
12] And accordingly, upon the counsel of some other Electors and Princes agreeing 
with us in religion, we, by the grace of God, Duke of Saxony, Elector, etc., sum-
moned certain eminent and least suspected theologians, who were also experienced 
and endowed with preeminent learning, to Torgau in the year 1576, for the purpose 
of promoting the godly design of harmony among the teachers of the Church. 
When they had assembled, they conferred devoutly with one another concerning 
the controverted articles and the peace document which we have just mentioned. 
And indeed, after prayers had first been offered to Almighty God, and His praise 
and glory, they comprised, with extraordinary care and diligence,â€”the Spirit of 
the Lord aiding them by His grace,â€”all those things which seemed to pertain 
Preface to the Christian Book of Concord

to, and to be required for, this deliberation in a very good and suitable document. 
Afterwards this book was transmitted to some chief adherents of the Augsburg 
Confession, Electors, Princes, and Deputies, with the request that they themselves, 
calling to their aid the most eminent and most learned theologians, should read it 
with anxious care and godly zeal, should diligently examine it, and commit their 
opinion and criticism upon it to writing, and, finally, express their judgment and 
the reasons therefore concerning the whole and each part.
13] Therefore, when we had received these criticisms, we found in them many 
godly and useful suggestions how the transmitted declaration of the pure Christian 
doctrine could be fortified and strengthened against corruptions and perversions 
by the testimonies of Holy Scripture, in order that in the course of time, under its 
guise, godless doctrines might not be concealed, but an altogether unvarnished dec-
laration of the pure truth might be transmitted to posterity. Therefore, out of those 
things which had been considered best when they came to us, that book of godly 
concord of which we spoke was composed, and completed in the form in which it 
will be submitted.
14] Then some of our rank (for at that time not all of us, nor some others as well, 
were able to do this, on account of certain causes which were in the way), have 
caused this book to be recited article by article and distinctly to the theologians, 
and the ministers of the church and of the schools collectively and individually, 
and have caused them to be urged to a diligent and accurate consideration of those 
parts of the doctrine which are contained in it.
15] Accordingly, when they perceived that the explanation of the controverted 
articles, indeed, agreed especially with the Word of God, and then with the Augs-
burg Confession, they received this Book of Concord with a very ready mind and 
an expression of their gratitude towards God, as expressing the godly and genuine 
meaning of the Augsburg Confession, having voluntarily, and indeed accurately, 
pondered and considered it, and they approved it and subscribed to it, and public-
ly bore witness concerning it with heart, mouth, and hand. Wherefore that godly 
agreement is called, and forever will be, not only the harmonious and concordant 
confession of some few of our theologians, but, in general, of the ministers of our 
churches and rectors of schools, jointly and severally, in our provinces and realms.
The Role of the Augsburg Confession
16] Now, our conferences and those of our illustrious predecessors which were 
undertaken with a godly and sincere intention, first at Frankfort on the Main, and 
afterward at Naumburg, and were recorded in writing, not only did not accomplish 
The Lutheran Confessions
6
that end and peaceful settlement which was desired, but from them even a defense 
for errors and false doctrines was sought by some, while it had never entered our 
mind, by this writing of ours, either to introduce, furnish a cover for, and establish 
any false doctrine, or in the least even to recede from the Confession presented in 
the year 1530 at Augsburg, but rather, as many of us as participated in the trans-
actions at Naumburg wholly reserved it to ourselves, and promised besides that 
if, in the course of time, anything would be desired with respect to the Augsburg 
Confession, or as often as necessity would seem to demand it, we would further 
declare all things thoroughly and at length. And that is the reason why we have 
elaborated in this Book of Concord with great and godly agreement a declaration 
of our constant and perpetual, wish, and a repetition of our Christian faith and 
confession. Accordingly, in order that no persons may permit themselves to be dis-
turbed by the charges of our adversaries spun out of their own mind, by which they 
boast that not even we are certain which is the true and genuine Augsburg Confes-
sion, but that both those who are now among the living and posterity also may be 
clearly and firmly taught and informed what that godly Confession is which both 
we and the churches and schools of our realms at all times professed and embraced, 
we emphatically testify that after the pure and immutable truth of God’s Word we 
wish to embrace the first Augsburg Confession alone which was presented to the 
Emperor Charles V, in the year 1530, at the famous Diet of Augsburg (this alone we 
say), and no other; copies of which, deposited in the archives of our predecessors, 
of excellent memory, who presented it in the Diet to Charles V himself, we caused 
to be compared by men worthy of confidence (lest we should be found wanting 
in most accurate regard for diligence) with the copy which was presented to the 
Emperor himself, and is preserved in the archives of the Holy Roman Empire, 
and we are sure that our copies, both the Latin and the German, in all things 
correspond to it, with like meaning. For this reason also we wished to insert the 
confession then presented in our explanation, which will be submitted herewith or 
in the Book of Concord, in order that all may understand that we have resolved to 
tolerate in our realms, churches, and schools no other doctrine than that which, in 
the year 1530, was approved at Augsburg in a solemn confession, by the above-men-
tioned Electors, Princes, and Deputies of the Empire. This Confession also, by the 
help of God, we will retain to our last breath, when we shall go forth from this life 
to the heavenly fatherland, to appear with joyful and undaunted mind and with a 
pure conscience before the tribunal of our Lord Jesus Christ. We hope, therefore, 
that our adversaries will hereafter spare both us and the ministers of our churches, 
and not employ these customary and most grievous accusations, that we cannot 
decide among ourselves upon anything as certain concerning our faith, and that, 
on this account, we are forging new confessions almost every year, yea, even every 
month.

The Second Edition of the Augsburg Confession
17] Moreover, as to the second edition of the Augsburg Confession, of which 
mention is made also in the transactions at Naumburg, we notice, what is also 
known to all, that, under the pretext of the words of this latter edition, some have 
wanted to cover and conceal corruptions with respect to the Lord’s Supper and 
other errors, and by means of published writings have attempted to obtrude them 
upon an ignorant populace; nor have they been moved by the distinct words of the 
Augsburg Confession, (which was first presented,) by which these errors are openly 
rejected, and from which a far different meaning than they wish can be shown. 
Therefore we have decided in this writing to testify publicly, and to inform all, that 
we wished neither then nor now in any way to defend, or excuse, or to approve, 
as though agreeing with the Gospel doctrine, false and godless doctrines and 
opinions which may lie concealed under certain coverings of words. We, indeed, 
never received the latter edition in a sense differing in any part from the former 
which was presented. Neither do we judge that other useful writings of Dr. Philip 
Melanchthon, or of Brenz, Urban Rhegius, Pomeranus, etc., should be rejected and 
condemned, so far as, in all things, they agree with the norm which has been set 
forth in the Book of Concord.
18] Now, although some theologians, and among them Luther himself, when they 
treated of the Lord’s Supper, were drawn, against their will, by their adversaries to 
disputations concerning the personal union of the two natures in Christ, neverthe-
less our theologians in the Book of Concord, and by the norm of sound doctrine 
which is in it, testify that both our constant and perpetual opinion and that of this 
book is that with regard to the Lord’s Supper godly men should be led to no other 
foundations than to those of the words of institution of the testament of our Lord 
Jesus Christ. For since He is both almighty and true, it is easy for Him to do those 
things which He has both instituted and promised in His Word. And indeed, when 
this foundation will not be assailed by their adversaries, they will not contend in 
this kind of argument concerning other methods of proof, but, in true simplicity 
of faith, will firmly insist upon the very plain words of Christ, which method is 
the safest, and is best suited to the instruction of uneducated men; for those things 
which have been discussed with greater exactness they do not understand. But 
indeed, since this our assertion and the simple meaning of the words of Christ’s 
testament are assailed by the adversaries, and rejected as godless and conflicting 
with the nature of true faith, and finally are claimed to be contrary to the Apostles’ 
Creed (especially to the statements concerning the incarnation of the Son of God, 
His ascension into heaven, and His sitting at the right hand of the almighty power 
and majesty of God) and therefore to be false, it must be shown by a true and 
The Lutheran Confessions
8
thorough interpretation of these articles that our opinion differs neither from the 
words of Christ nor from these articles.
The Book of Concord
19] As to the phrases and forms of expression which are employed in this Book 
of Concord, when we treat of the majesty of the human nature in the person of 
Christ, elevated and placed at the right hand of God, in order to remove all subtle 
suspicions and causes of offense which might arise from the different significations 
of the word abstract, (as both the schools and the fathers have hitherto employed 
this term,) our theologians in distinct and express words wish to testify that this 
majesty is in no way to be ascribed to the human nature of Christ outside of the 
personal union, neither are we to grant that the human nature possesses this majes-
ty as its own or by itself (even in the personal union) essentially, formally, habitu-
ally, subjectively. (The schools like these terms, although they are not good Latin.) 
For if we would adopt this method both of speaking and teaching, the divine 
and human natures with their properties would be confounded, and the human, 
with respect to its essence and properties, would be made equal to the divine, yea, 
indeed, would be altogether denied. Therefore the theologians judge that we ought 
to believe that this occurs according to the method and economy of the hypostatic 
union, as learned antiquity has spoken cautiously concerning this subject, that it 
is a mystery so great as to exceed all the powers of our natural ability and under-
standing.
20] As to the condemnations, censures, and rejections of godless doctrines, and 
especially of that which has arisen concerning the Lord’s Supper, these indeed 
had to be expressly set forth in this our declaration and thorough explanation 
and decision of controverted articles, not only that all should guard against these 
condemned doctrines, but also for certain other reasons could in no way have been 
passed by. Thus, as it is in no way our design and purpose to condemn those men 
who err from a certain simplicity of mind, but are not blasphemers against the 
truth of the heavenly doctrine, much less, indeed, entire churches, which are either 
under the Roman Empire of the German nation or elsewhere; nay, rather has it 
been our intention and disposition in this manner openly to censure and condemn 
only the fanatical opinions and their obstinate and blasphemous teachers, (which, 
we judge, should in no way be tolerated in our dominions, churches, and schools,) 
because these errors conflict with the express Word of God, and that, too, in such 
a way that they cannot be reconciled with it. We have undertaken this also for this 
reason, viz., that all godly persons might be warned diligently to avoid them. For 
we have no doubt whatever that even in those churches which have hitherto not 
Preface to the Christian Book of Concord
9
agreed with us in all things many godly and by no means wicked men are found 
who follow their own simplicity, and do not understand aright the matter itself, 
but in no way approve the blasphemies which are cast forth against the Holy 
Supper as it is administered in our churches, according to Christ’s institution, 
and, with the unanimous approval of all good men, is taught in accordance with 
the words of the testament itself. We are also in great hope that, if they would be 
taught aright concerning all these things, the Spirit of the Lord aiding them, they 
would agree with us, and with our churches and schools, to the infallible truth of 
God’s Word. And assuredly, the duty is especially incumbent upon all the theolo-
gians and ministers of the Church, that with such moderation as is becoming they 
teach from the Word of God also those who either from a certain simplicity or 
ignorance have erred from the truth, concerning the peril of their salvation, and 
that they fortify them against corruptions lest perhaps, while the blind are leaders 
of the blind, all may perish. Wherefore, by this writing of ours, we testify in the 
sight of Almighty God and before the entire Church that it has never been our 
purpose, by means of this godly formula for union to create trouble or danger to 
the godly who to-day are suffering persecution. For, as we have already entered into 
the fellowship of grief with them, moved by Christian love, so we are shocked at 
the persecution and most grievous tyranny which with such severity is exercised 
against these poor men, and sincerely detest it. For in no way do we consent to the 
shedding of that innocent blood, which undoubtedly will be required with great 
severity from the persecutors at the awful judgment of the Lord and before the 
tribunal of Christ, and they will then certainly render a most strict account, and 
suffer fearful punishment.
21] In regard to these matters (as we have mentioned above) it has always been our 
purpose that in our lands, dominions, schools, and churches no other doctrine be 
proclaimed and accurately set forth than that which is founded upon the Word of 
God, and contained in the Augsburg Confession and the Apology, (and that, too, 
when understood properly in its genuine sense,) and that opinions conflicting with 
these be not admitted; and indeed, with this design, this formula of agreement was 
begun and completed. Therefore before God and all mortals we once more declare 
and testify that in the declaration of the controverted articles, of which mention 
has already been made several times, we are not introducing a new confession, or 
one different from that which was presented in the year 1530 to Charles V, of happy 
memory, but that we wished indeed to lead our churches and schools, first of all, 
to the fountains of Holy Scripture, and to the Creeds, and then to the Augsburg 
Confession, of which we have before made mention. We most earnestly exhort 
that especially the young men who are being educated for the holy ministry of the 
churches and schools be instructed in this faithfully and diligently, in order that 
the pure doctrine and profession of our faith may, by the help of the Holy Ghost, 
The Lutheran Confessions
10
be preserved and propagated also to our posterity, until the glorious advent of 
Jesus Christ, our only Redeemer and Savior. Since, therefore, such is the case, and 
being instructed from the Prophetic and Apostolic Scriptures, we are sure con-
cerning our doctrine and confession, and by the grace of the Holy Ghost our minds 
and consciences have been confirmed to a greater degree, we have thought that this 
Book of Concord ought to be published. For it seemed exceedingly necessary that, 
amidst so many errors that had arisen in our times, as well as causes of offense, 
variances, and these long-continued dissensions, there should exist a godly explana-
tion and agreement concerning all these controversies, derived from God’s Word, 
according to the terms of which the pure doctrine might be discriminated and 
separated from the false.
22] Besides, this matter is of importance also in this respect, viz., that troublesome 
and contentious men, who do not suffer themselves to be bound to any formula of 
the pure doctrine, may not have the liberty, according to their good pleasure, to 
excite controversies which furnish ground for offense, and to publish and con-
tend for extravagant opinions. For the result of these things, at length, is that the 
pure doctrine is obscured and lost, and nothing is transmitted to posterity except 
academical opinions and suspensions of judgment. To these considerations was also 
added this that, agreeably to the office committed to us by God, we understand 
that we owe our subjects this, viz., that we should diligently care for the things 
which pertain to this life and the life to come, and that we should take pains, with 
the greatest earnestness and to our utmost ability, to attend to those matters which 
promote the extension of God’s name and glory, the propagation of His Word, 
(from which alone we hope for salvation,) the peace and tranquillity of churches 
and schools, and the instruction and consolation of disturbed consciences, espe-
cially since it is certainly a settled fact with us that this salutary work of Christian 
concord has already been longed for and expected with anxious prayers and the 
greatest desire by many good and sincere men both of the highest and the lowest 
rank. For from the beginning of this work of peaceful settlement, indeed, we have 
not been of the opinion, neither are we even now, that this work of concord, which 
is so salutary and exceedingly necessary, should be removed from the eyes of men, 
and altogether concealed, and that the light of heavenly truth should be placed un-
der a bushel or table; wherefore we ought in no wise to defer its publication. Nor 
do we doubt that all the godly who are lovers of the heavenly truth, and of concord 
pleasing to God, will approve, together with us, of this salutary, useful, godly, and 
very necessary undertaking, and that they will act so that nothing may be wanting 
in them, even to the greatest effort, whereby the glory of God and the common 
welfare in both temporal and eternal things may be promoted.
Preface to the Christian Book of Concord

Conclusion
23] We indeed (to repeat in conclusion what we have mentioned several times 
above) have wished, in this work of concord, in no way to devise what is new, or 
to depart from the truth of the heavenly doctrine which our ancestors, renowned 
for their piety, as well as we ourselves, have acknowledged and professed. We 
mean that doctrine, which, having been derived from the Prophetic and Apostolic 
Scriptures, is contained in the three ancient Creeds, in the Augsburg Confession, 
presented in the year 1530 to the Emperor Charles V, of excellent memory, then in 
the Apology, which was added to this, in the Smalcald Articles, and lastly in both 
the Catechisms of that excellent man, Dr. Luther. Therefore we also have deter-
mined not to depart even a finger’s breadth either from the subjects themselves, or 
from the phrases which are found in them, but, the Spirit of the Lord aiding us, to 
persevere constantly, with the greatest harmony, in this godly agreement, and we 
intend to examine all controversies according to this true norm and declaration of 
the pure doctrine. Then, also with the rest of the Electors, Princes, and Deputies of 
the Holy Roman Empire, and other kings, princes, and magnates of the Christian 
state, in accordance with the constitution of the Holy Empire, and the agreements 
which we have with them, we determined and desired to cultivate peace and har-
mony, and to render to each one, according to his rank, all duties belonging to us, 
together with the offices of friendship.
24] Besides, having made known our objects, we will also earnestly apply ourselves 
with great strictness and the most ardent zeal to the defense of this work of con-
cord, by diligent visitations of the churches and schools in our realms, oversight of 
printing offices, and other salutary means, according to occasions and circumstanc-
es which may be offered to ourselves and others. We will also take pains, if either 
controversies already composed should be renewed, or new controversies concern-
ing religion should arise, to remove and settle them betimes, for the purpose of 
avoiding offense, without long and dangerous digressions.

The Apostles’ Creed
I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.
And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy 
Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, 
and buried; He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He 
ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; 
from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy catholic* Church, the communion of saints; 
the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting. Amen.
The Nicene Creed
I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all 
things visible and invisible.
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Fa-
ther before all worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, 
not made, being of one substance with the Father; by whom all things were made; 
who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate 
by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified also 
for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose 
again according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the 
right hand of the Father; and He shall come again with glory to judge the quick 
and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.
And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life, who proceedeth from 
the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped 
and glorified; who spake by the Prophets. And I believe in one holy catholic and 
apostolic Church.I acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of sins; and I look 
for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

The Lutheran Confessions

The Athanasian Creed
Written against the Arians.
Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic 
faith. Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he 
shall perish everlastingly.
And the catholic faith is this, that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in 
Unity; Neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance. For there is 
one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghost. But 
the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is all one: the glory 
equal, the majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the 
Holy Ghost. The Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the Holy Ghost uncre-
ated. The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy Ghost 
incomprehensible. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost eternal. 
And yet they are not three Eternals, but one Eternal. As there are not three Uncre-
ated nor three Incomprehensibles, but one Uncreated and one Incomprehensible. 
So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Ghost almighty. 
And yet they are not three Almighties, but one Almighty. So the Father is God, the 
Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet they are not three Gods, but one 
God. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Ghost Lord. And 
yet not three Lords, but one Lord. For like as we are compelled by the Christian 
verity to acknowledge every Person by Himself to be God and Lord, So are we 
forbidden by the catholic religion to say, There be three Gods, or three Lords.
The Father is made of none: neither created nor begotten. The Son is of the Father 
alone; not made, nor created, but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of 
the Son: neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding. So there is one 
Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy 
Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is before or after other; none is greater or less 
than another; But the whole three Persons are coeternal together, and coequal: so 
that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to 
be worshiped. He, therefore, that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.
Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also believe faithfully 
the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right faith is, that we believe and 
confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man; God of the 
Substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and Man of the substance of 
His mother, born in the world; Perfect God and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul 
and human flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and in-
The Three Ecumenical or Universal Creeds
15
ferior to the Father as touching His manhood; Who, although He be God and Man, 
yet He is not two, but one Christ: One, not by conversion of the Godhead into 
flesh, but by taking the manhood into God; One altogether; not by confusion of 
Substance, but by unity of Person. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, 
so God and Man is one Christ; Who suffered for our salvation; descended into hell, 
rose again the third day from the dead; He ascended into heaven; He sitteth on the 
right hand of the Father, God Almighty; from whence He shall come to judge the 
quick and the dead. At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies, 
and shall give an account of their own works. And they that have done good shall 
go into life everlasting; and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire.
This is the catholic faith; which except a man believe faithfully and firmly, he 
cannot be saved.

The Augsburg Confession
The Confession of Faith which was submitted to His Imperial Majesty Charles V at 
the Diet of Augsburg in the year 1530 by certain princes and cities
I will speak of thy testimonies before kings, and will not be put to shame. ~ 
Psalm 119:46
Preface to the Emperor Charles V.
1] Most Invincible Emperor, Caesar Augustus, Most Clement Lord: Inasmuch as 
Your Imperial Majesty has summoned a Diet of the Empire here at Augsburg to de-
liberate concerning measures against the Turk, that most atrocious, hereditary, and 
ancient enemy of the Christian name and religion, in what way, namely, effectually 
to withstand his furor and assaults by strong and lasting military provision; 2] and 
then also concerning dissensions in the matter of our holy religion and Christian 
Faith, that in this matter of religion the opinions and judgments of the parties 
might be heard in each other’s presence; and considered and weighed 3] among 
ourselves in mutual charity, leniency, and kindness, in order that, after the removal 
and correction of such things as have been treated and understood in a different 
manner in the writings on either side, these matters may be settled and brought 
back to one simple truth and Christian concord, 4] that for the future one pure 
and true religion may be embraced and maintained by us, that as we all are under 
one Christ and do battle under Him, so we may be able also to live in unity and 
concord in the one Christian Church.
And inasmuch as we, the undersigned Elector and 5] Princes, with others joined 
with us, have been called to the aforesaid Diet the same as the other Electors, 
Princes, and Estates, in obedient compliance with the Imperial mandate, we have 
promptly come to Augsburg, and—what we do not mean to say as boasting—we 
were among the first to be here.
6] Accordingly, since even here at Augsburg at the very beginning of the Diet, 
Your Imperial Majesty caused to be proposed to the Electors, Princes, and other 
Estates of the Empire, amongst other things, that the several Estates of the Empire, 
on the strength of the Imperial edict, should set forth and submit their opinions 
and judgments in the German and the Latin 7] language, and since on the ensuing 
Wednesday, answer was given to Your Imperial Majesty, after due deliberation, 
that we would submit the Articles of our Confession for our side on next Wednes-
day, therefore, in obedience to Your Imperial Majesty’s 8] wishes, we offer, in this 
The Augsburg Confession
17
matter of religion, the Confession of our preachers and of ourselves, showing what 
manner of doctrine from the Holy Scriptures and the pure Word of God has been 
up to this time set forth in our lands, dukedoms, dominions, and cities, and taught 
in our churches.
9] And if the other Electors, Princes, and Estates of the Empire will, according 
to the said Imperial proposition, present similar writings, to wit, in Latin and 
German, giving their opinions in this 10] matter of religion, we, with the Princes 
and friends aforesaid, here before Your Imperial Majesty, our most clement Lord 
are prepared to confer amicably concerning all possible ways and means, in order 
that we may come together, as far as this may be honorably done, and, the matter 
between us on both sides being peacefully discussed without offensive strife, the 
dissension, by God’s help, may be done away and brought back to one true accor-
dant 11] religion; for as we all are under one Christ and do battle under Him, we 
ought to confess the one Christ, after the tenor of Your Imperial Majesty’s edict, 
and everything ought to be conducted according to the truth of God; and this it is 
what, with most fervent prayers, we entreat of God.
12] However, as regards the rest of the Electors, Princes, and Estates, who consti-
tute the other part, if no progress should be made, nor some result be attained by 
this treatment of the cause of religion after the manner in which Your Imperial 
Majesty has wisely held that it should be dealt with and treated namely, by such 
mutual presentation of writings and calm conferring together among ourselves, 
13] we at least leave with you a clear testimony, that we here in no wise are holding 
back from anything that could bring about Christian concord,—such as could 
be effected with God and a good conscience,—as 14] also Your Imperial Majesty 
and, next, the other Electors and Estates of the Empire, and all who are moved by 
sincere love and zeal for religion, and who will give an impartial hearing to this 
matter, will graciously deign to take notice and to understand this from this Con-
fession of ours and of our associates.
15] Your Imperial Majesty also, not only once but often, graciously signified to the 
Electors Princes, and Estates of the Empire, and at the Diet of Spires held A.D. 
1526, according to the form of Your Imperial instruction and commission given and 
prescribed, caused it to be stated and publicly proclaimed that 16] Your Majesty, in 
dealing with this matter of religion, for certain reasons which were alleged in Your 
Majesty’s name, was not willing to decide and could not determine anything, but 
that Your Majesty would diligently use Your Majesty’s office with the Roman Pon-
tiff for the convening of a General Council. 17] The same matter was thus publicly 
set forth at greater length a year ago at the last Diet which met at Spires. 18] There 
Your Imperial Majesty, through His Highness Ferdinand, King of Bohemia and 
The Lutheran Confessions
18
Hungary, our friend and clement Lord, as well as through the Orator and Imperial 
Commissioners caused this, among other things, to be submitted: that Your Im-
perial Majesty had taken notice of; and pondered, the resolution of Your Majesty’s 
Representative in the Empire, and of the President and Imperial Counselors, and 
the Legates from other Estates convened at Ratisbon, 19] concerning the calling 
of a Council, and that your Imperial Majesty also judged it to be expedient to con-
vene a Council; and that Your Imperial Majesty did not doubt the Roman Pontiff 
could be induced to 20] hold a General Council, because the matters to be adjusted 
between Your Imperial Majesty and the Roman Pontiff were nearing agreement 
and Christian reconciliation; therefore Your Imperial Majesty himself signified 
that he would endeavor to secure the said Chief Pontiff’s consent for convening, 
together with your Imperial Majesty such General Council, to be published as soon 
as possible by letters that were to be sent out.
21] If the outcome, therefore, should be such that the differences between us and 
the other parties in the matter of religion should not be amicably and in charity 
settled, then here, before Your Imperial Majesty we make the offer in all obedience, 
in addition to what we have already done, that we will all appear and defend our 
cause in such a general, free Christian Council, for the convening of which there 
has always been accordant action and agreement of votes in all the Imperial Diets 
held during Your Majesty’s reign, on the part of the Electors, Princes, and other 
Estates of the Empire. 22] To the assembly of this General Council, and at the same 
time to Your Imperial Majesty, we have, even before this, in due manner and form 
of law, addressed ourselves and made appeal in this matter, by far the greatest and 
gravest. To this 23] appeal, both to Your Imperial Majesty and to a Council, we still 
adhere; neither do we intend nor would it be possible for us, to relinquish it by this 
or any other document, unless the matter between us and the other side, accord-
ing to the tenor of the latest Imperial citation should be amicably and charitably 
settled, allayed, and brought to Christian concord; 24] and regarding this we even 
here solemnly and publicly testify.
Chief Articles of Faith
Article I: Of God.
1] Our Churches, with common consent, do teach that the decree of the Council 
of Nicaea concerning the Unity of the Divine Essence and concerning the Three 
Persons, is true and to be believed without any doubting; 2] that is to say, there is 
one Divine Essence which is called and which is God: eternal, without body, with-
The Augsburg Confession
19
out parts, of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness, the Maker and Preserver of all 
things, visible and invisible; and 3] yet there are three Persons, of the same essence 
and power, who also are coeternal, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And 
the term “person” 4] they use as the Fathers have used it, to signify, not a part or 
quality in another, but that which subsists of itself.
5] They condemn all heresies which have sprung up against this article, as the 
Manichaeans, who assumed two principles, one Good and the other Evil: also the 
Valentinians, Arians, Eunomians, Mohammedans, and all such. 6] They condemn 
also the Samosatenes, old and new, who, contending that there is but one Per-
son, sophistically and impiously argue that the Word and the Holy Ghost are not 
distinct Persons, but that “Word” signifies a spoken word, and “Spirit” signifies 
motion created in things.
Article II: Of Original Sin.
1] Also they teach that since the fall of Adam all men begotten in the natural way 
are born with sin, that is, without the fear of God, without trust in God, and with 
2] concupiscence; and that this disease, or vice of origin, is truly sin, even now con-
demning and bringing eternal death upon those not born again through Baptism 
and the Holy Ghost.
3] They condemn the Pelagians and others who deny that original depravity is sin, 
and who, to obscure the glory of Christ’s merit and benefits, argue that man can be 
justified before God by his own strength and reason. 
Article III: Of the Son of God.
1] Also they teach that the Word, that is, the Son of God, did assume the human 
nature in 2] the womb of the blessed Virgin Mary, so that there are two natures, 
the divine and the human, inseparably enjoined in one Person, one Christ, true 
God and true man, who was born of the Virgin Mary, truly suffered, was crucified, 
dead, and 3] buried, that He might reconcile the Father unto us, and be a sacrifice, 
not only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.
4] He also descended into hell, and truly rose again the third day; afterward He as-
cended into heaven that He might sit on the right hand of the Father, and forever 
reign and have dominion over all creatures, and sanctify 5] them that believe in 
The Lutheran Confessions
20
Him, by sending the Holy Ghost into their hearts, to rule, comfort, and quicken 
them, and to defend them against the devil and the power of sin.
6] The same Christ shall openly come again to judge the quick and the dead, etc., 
according to the Apostles’ Creed. 
Article IV: Of Justification.
1] Also they teach that men cannot be justified before God by their own strength, 
merits, or works, but are freely justified for 2] Christ’s sake, through faith, when 
they believe that they are received into favor, and that their sins are forgiven for 
Christ’s sake, who, by His death, has made satisfaction for our sins. 3] This faith 
God imputes for righteousness in His sight. Rom. 3 and 4.
Article V: Of the Ministry.
1] That we may obtain this faith, the Ministry of Teaching the Gospel and admin-
istering the Sacraments was instituted. For through the Word and Sacraments, as 
through instruments, 2] the Holy Ghost is given, who works faith; where and when 
it pleases God, in them that hear 3] the Gospel, to wit, that God, not for our own 
merits, but for Christ’s sake, justifies those who believe that they are received into 
grace for Christ’s sake.
4] They condemn the Anabaptists and others who think that the Holy Ghost 
comes to men without the external Word, through their own preparations and 
works. 
Article VI: Of New Obedience.
1] Also they teach that this faith is bound to bring forth good fruits, and that it is 
necessary to do good works commanded by God, because of God’s will, but that we 
should not rely on those works to merit justification 2] before God. For remission 
of sins and justification is apprehended by faith, as also the voice of Christ attests: 
When ye shall have done all these things, say: We are unprofitable servants. Luke 
17:10. The same is also taught by 3] the Fathers. For Ambrose says: It is ordained 
of God that he who believes in Christ is saved, freely receiving remission of sins, 
without works, by faith alone. 
The Augsburg Confession
21
Article VII: Of the Church.
1] Also they teach that one holy Church is to continue forever. The Church is the 
congregation of saints, in which the Gospel is rightly taught and the Sacraments 
are rightly administered.
2] And to the true unity of the Church it is enough to agree concerning the doc-
trine of the Gospel and 3] the administration of the Sacraments. Nor is it necessary 
that human traditions, that is, rites or ceremonies, instituted by men, should be 
everywhere alike. 4] As Paul says: One faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of 
all, etc. Eph. 4:5-6.
Article VIII: What the Church Is.
1] Although the Church properly is the congregation of saints and true believ-
ers, nevertheless, since in this life many hypocrites and evil persons are mingled 
therewith, it is lawful to use Sacraments administered by evil men, according to 
the saying of Christ: The Scribes and 2] the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat, etc. Matt. 
23:2. Both the Sacraments and Word are effectual by reason of the institution and 
commandment of Christ, notwithstanding they be administered by evil men.
3] They condemn the Donatists, and such like, who denied it to be lawful to use the 
ministry of evil men in the Church, and who thought the ministry of evil men to 
be unprofitable and of none effect.
Article IX: Of Baptism.
1] Of Baptism they teach that it is necessary 2] to salvation, and that through Bap-
tism is offered the grace of God, and that children are to be baptized who, being 
offered to God through Baptism are received into God’s grace.
3] They condemn the Anabaptists, who reject the baptism of children, and say that 
children are saved without Baptism.
Article X: Of the Lord’s Supper.
1] Of the Supper of the Lord they teach that the Body and Blood of Christ are 
truly present, and are distributed 2] to those who eat the Supper of the Lord; and 
they reject those that teach otherwise.
The Lutheran Confessions
22
Article XI: Of Confession.
1] Of Confession they teach that Private Absolution ought to be retained in the 
churches, although in confession 2] an enumeration of all sins is not necessary. For 
it is impossible according to the Psalm: Who can understand his errors? Ps. 19:12.
Article XII: Of Repentance.
1] Of Repentance they teach that for those who have fallen after Baptism there 
is remission of sins whenever they are converted 2] and that the Church ought to 
impart absolution to those thus returning to repentance. Now, repentance consists 
properly of these 3] two parts: One is contrition, that is, 4] terrors smiting the 
conscience through the knowledge of sin; the other is faith, which is born of 5] the 
Gospel, or of absolution, and believes that for Christ’s sake, sins are forgiven, com-
forts 6] the conscience, and delivers it from terrors. Then good works are bound to 
follow, which are the fruits of repentance.
7] They condemn the Anabaptists, who deny that those once justified can lose the 
Holy Ghost. Also those who contend that some may attain to such 8] perfection in 
this life that they cannot sin.
9] The Novatians also are condemned, who would not absolve such as had fallen 
after Baptism, though they returned to repentance.
10] They also are rejected who do not teach that remission of sins comes through 
faith but command us to merit grace through satisfactions of our own.
Article XIII: Of the Use of the Sacraments.
1] Of the Use of the Sacraments they teach that the Sacraments were ordained, not 
only to be marks of profession among men, but rather to be signs and testimonies 
of the will of God 2] toward us, instituted to awaken and confirm faith in those 
who use them. Wherefore we must so use the Sacraments that faith be added to 
believe the promises which are offered and set forth through the Sacraments.
3] They therefore condemn those who teach that the Sacraments justify by the 
outward act, and who do not teach that, in the use of the Sacraments, faith which 
believes that sins are forgiven, is required.
The Augsburg Confession

Article XIV: Of Ecclesiastical Order.
Of Ecclesiastical Order they teach that no one should publicly teach in the Church 
or administer the Sacraments unless he be regularly called. 
Article XV: Of Ecclesiastical Usages.
1] Of Usages in the Church they teach that those ought to be observed which may 
be observed without sin, and which are profitable unto tranquillity and good order 
in the Church, as particular holy days, festivals, and the like.
2] Nevertheless, concerning such things men are admonished that consciences are 
not to be burdened, as though such observance was necessary to salvation.
3] They are admonished also that human traditions instituted to propitiate God, 
to merit grace, and to make satisfaction for sins, are opposed to the Gospel and the 
doctrine of faith. Wherefore vows and traditions concerning meats and 4] days, 
etc., instituted to merit grace and to make satisfaction for sins, are useless and 
contrary to the Gospel.
Article XVI: Of Civil Affairs.
1] Of Civil Affairs they teach that lawful civil ordinances are good works of God, 
and that 2] it is right for Christians to bear civil office, to sit as judges, to judge 
matters by the Imperial and other existing laws, to award just punishments, to 
engage in just wars, to serve as soldiers, to make legal contracts, to hold property, 
to make oath when required by the magistrates, to marry a wife, to be given in 
marriage.
3] They condemn the Anabaptists who forbid these civil offices to Christians.
4] They condemn also those who do not place evangelical perfection in the fear of 
God and in faith, but in forsaking civil offices, for 5] the Gospel teaches an eternal 
righteousness of the heart. Meanwhile, it does not destroy the State or the family, 
but very much requires that they be preserved as ordinances of God, and that char-
ity be practiced in such 6] ordinances. Therefore, Christians are necessarily bound 
to obey their own magistrates 7] and laws save only when commanded to sin; for 
then they ought to obey God rather than men. Acts 5:29. 
The Lutheran Confessions
24
Article XVII: Of Christ’s Return to Judgment.
1] Also they teach that at the Consummation of the World Christ will appear for 
judgment, and 2] will raise up all the dead; He will give to the godly and elect eter-
nal life and everlasting joys, 3] but ungodly men and the devils He will condemn to 
be tormented without end.
4] They condemn the Anabaptists, who think that there will be an end to the pun-
ishments of condemned men and devils.
5] They condemn also others who are now spreading certain Jewish opinions, that 
before the resurrection of the dead the godly shall take possession of the kingdom 
of the world, the ungodly being everywhere suppressed.
Article XVIII: Of Free Will.
1] Of Free Will they teach that man’s will has some liberty to choose civil righ-
teousness, and to work 2] things subject to reason. But it has no power, without 
the Holy Ghost, to work the righteousness of God, that is, spiritual righteousness; 
since the natural man 3] receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. 2:14; 
but this righteousness is wrought in the heart when the Holy Ghost is received 
4] through the Word. These things are said in as many words by Augustine in his 
Hypognosticon, Book III: We grant that all men have a free will, free, inasmuch as 
it has the judgment of reason; not that it is thereby capable, without God, either 
to begin, or, at least, to complete aught in things pertaining to God, but only in 
works of this life, whether good 5] or evil. “Good” I call those works which spring 
from the good in nature, such as, willing to labor in the field, to eat and drink, to 
have a friend, to clothe oneself, to build a house, to marry a wife, to raise cattle, to 
learn diverse useful arts, or whatsoever good 6] pertains to this life. For all of these 
things are not without dependence on the providence of God; yea, of Him and 
through Him they are and have their being. “Evil” 7] I call such works as willing 
to worship an idol, to commit murder, etc. 8] They condemn the Pelagians and 
others, who teach that without the Holy Ghost, by the power of nature alone, we 
are able to love God above all things; also to do the commandments of God as 
touching “the substance of the act.” For, although nature is able in a manner to do 
the outward work, 9] (for it is able to keep the hands from theft and murder,) yet it 
cannot produce the inward motions, such as the fear of God, trust in God, chastity, 
patience, etc. 
The Augsburg Confession
25
Article XIX: Of the Cause of Sin.
Of the Cause of Sin they teach that, although God does create and preserve nature, 
yet the cause of sin is the will of the wicked, that is, of the devil and ungodly men; 
which will, unaided of God, turns itself from God, as Christ says John 8:44: When 
he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own.
Article XX: Of Good Works.
1] Our teachers are falsely accused of forbidding Good Works. 2] For their 
published writings on the Ten Commandments, and others of like import, bear 
witness that they have taught to good purpose concerning all estates and duties of 
life, as to what estates of life and what works in every calling be pleasing to God. 
3] Concerning these things preachers heretofore taught but little, and urged only 
childish and needless works, as particular holy-days, particular fasts, brotherhoods, 
pilgrimages, services in honor of saints, the use of rosaries, monasticism, and such 
like. 4] Since our adversaries have been admonished of these things, they are now 
unlearning them, and do not preach these unprofitable works as heretofore. 5] 
Besides, they begin to mention faith, of which there was heretofore marvelous 
silence. 6] They teach that we are justified not by works only, but they conjoin 
faith and works, and say that we are justified by faith and works. 7] This doctrine 
is more tolerable than the former one, and can afford more consolation than their 
old doctrine.
8] Forasmuch, therefore, as the doctrine concerning faith, which ought to be the 
chief one in the Church, has lain so long unknown, as all must needs grant that 
there was the deepest silence in their sermons concerning the righteousness of 
faith, while only the doctrine of works was treated in the churches, our teachers 
have instructed the churches concerning faith as follows:—
9] First, that our works cannot reconcile God or merit forgiveness of sins, grace, 
and justification, but that we obtain this only by faith when we believe that we are 
received into favor for Christ’s sake, who alone has been set forth the Mediator and 
Propitiation, 1 Tim. 2:5, in order that the Father may be reconciled through Him. 
10] Whoever, therefore, trusts that by works he merits grace, despises the merit 
and grace of Christ, and seeks a way to God without Christ, by human strength, al-
though Christ has said of Himself: I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. John 14:6.
The Lutheran Confessions
26
11] This doctrine concerning faith is everywhere treated by Paul, Eph. 2:8: By grace 
are ye saved through faith; and that not of your selves; it is the gift of God, not of 
works, etc.
12] And lest any one should craftily say that a new interpretation of Paul has been 
devised by us, this entire matter is supported by the testimonies of the Fathers. 
For 13] Augustine, in many volumes, defends grace and the righteousness of faith, 
over against the merits of works. 14] And Ambrose, in his De Vocatione Gentium, 
and elsewhere, teaches to like effect. For in his De Vocatione Gentium he says as 
follows: Redemption by the blood of Christ would become of little value, neither 
would the preeminence of man’s works be superseded by the mercy of God, if justi-
fication, which is wrought through grace, were due to the merits going before, so as 
to be, not the free gift of a donor, but the reward due to the laborer.
15] But, although this doctrine is despised by the inexperienced, nevertheless 
God-fearing and anxious consciences find by experience that it brings the greatest 
consolation, because consciences cannot be set at rest through any works, but only 
by faith, when they take the sure ground that for Christ’s sake they have a recon-
ciled God. As Paul teaches Rom. 5:1: 16] Being justified by faith, we have peace 
with God. 17] This whole doctrine is to be referred to that conflict of the terrified 
conscience, neither can it be understood apart from that conflict. Therefore 18] 
inexperienced and profane men judge ill concerning this matter, who dream that 
Christian righteousness is nothing but civil and philosophical righteousness.
19] Heretofore consciences were plagued with the doctrine of works, they did not 
hear the consolation from the Gospel. 20] Some persons were driven by conscience 
into the desert, into monasteries hoping there to merit grace by a monastic life. 21] 
Some also devised other works whereby to merit grace and make satisfaction for 
sins. 22] Hence there was very great need to treat of, and renew, this doctrine of 
faith in Christ, to the end that anxious consciences should not be without consola-
tion but that they might know that grace and forgiveness of sins and justification 
are apprehended by faith in Christ.
23] Men are also admonished that here the term “faith” does not signify merely the 
knowledge of the history, such as is in the ungodly and in the devil, but signifies 
a faith which believes, not merely the history, but also the effect of the history—
namely, this article: the forgiveness of sins, to wit, that we have grace, righteous-
ness, and forgiveness of sins through Christ.
24] Now he that knows that he has a Father gracious to him through Christ, truly 
knows God; he knows also that God cares for him, and calls upon God; in a word, 
The Augsburg Confession
27
he is not 25] without God, as the heathen. For devils and the ungodly are not able 
to believe this article: the forgiveness of sins. Hence, they hate God as an enemy, 
call not upon Him, 26] and expect no good from Him. Augustine also admonishes 
his readers concerning the word “faith,” and teaches that the term “faith” is accept-
ed in the Scriptures not for knowledge such as is in the ungodly but for confidence 
which consoles and encourages the terrified mind.
27] Furthermore, it is taught on our part that it is necessary to do good works, not 
that we should trust to merit grace by them, but because it is the will of God. 28] 
It is only by faith that forgiveness of sins is apprehended, and that, for nothing. 
29] And because through faith the Holy Ghost is received, hearts are renewed and 
endowed with new affections, so as to be able to bring forth good works. 30] For 
Ambrose says: Faith is the mother of a good will and right doing. 31] For man’s 
powers without the Holy Ghost are full of ungodly affections, and are too weak to 
do works which are good in God’s sight. 32] Besides, they are in the power of the 
devil who impels men to divers sins, 33] to ungodly opinions, to open crimes. This 
we may see in the philosophers, who, although they endeavored to live an honest 
life could not succeed, 34] but were defiled with many open crimes. Such is the fee-
bleness of man when he is without faith and without the Holy Ghost, and governs 
himself only by human strength.
35] Hence it may be readily seen that this doctrine is not to be charged with pro-
hibiting good works, but rather the more to be commended, because it shows how 
we are enabled to do good works. 36] For without faith human nature can in no 
wise do the works of the First or of the Second Commandment. 37] Without faith 
it does not call upon God, nor expect anything from God, nor bear the cross, but 
seeks, and trusts in, man’s help. 38] And thus, when there is no faith and trust in 
God all manner of lusts and human devices rule in the heart. 39] Wherefore Christ 
said, John 15:5: Without Me ye can do nothing; 40] and the Church sings:
Lacking Thy divine favor, 
There is nothing found in man, 
Naught in him is harmless.
Article XXI: Of the Worship of the Saints.
1] Of the Worship of Saints they teach that the memory of saints may be set before 
us, that we may follow their faith and good works, according to our calling, as the 
Emperor may follow the example of David in making war to drive away the Turk 
from his country. 2] For both are kings. But the Scripture teaches not the invoca-
The Lutheran Confessions
28
tion of saints or to ask help of saints, since it sets before us the one Christ as the 
Mediator, Propitiation, High Priest, and Intercessor. 3] He is to be prayed to, and 
has promised that He will hear our prayer; and this worship He approves above 
all, to wit, that in all afflictions He be called upon, 1 John 2:1: 4] If any man sin, we 
have an Advocate with the Father, etc.
5] This is about the Sum of our Doctrine, in which, as can be seen, there is nothing 
that varies from the Scriptures, or from the Church Catholic, or from the Church 
of Rome as known from its writers. This being the case, they judge harshly who 
insist that our teachers be regarded as heretics. 6] There is, however, disagreement 
on certain abuses, which have crept into the Church without rightful authority. 
And even in these, if there were some difference, there should be proper lenity on 
the part of bishops to bear with us by reason of the Confession which we have now 
reviewed; because even the Canons are not so severe as to demand the same rites 
everywhere, neither, at any time, have the rites of all churches been the same; 7] 
although, among us, in large part, the ancient rites are diligently observed. 8] For 
it is a false and malicious charge that all the ceremonies, all the things instituted 
of old, are abolished in our churches. 9] But it has been a common complaint that 
some abuses were connected with the ordinary rites. These, inasmuch as they could 
not be approved with a good conscience, have been to some extent corrected.
Articles in which are Reviewed the Abuses which have been Cor-
rected.
10] Inasmuch, then, as our churches dissent in no article of the faith from the 
Church Catholic, but only omit some abuses which are new, and which have been 
erroneously accepted by the corruption of the times, contrary to the intent of the 
Canons, we pray that Your Imperial Majesty would graciously hear both what has 
been changed, and what were the reasons why the people were not compelled to 
observe those abuses against their conscience. 11] Nor should Your Imperial Majes-
ty believe those who, in order to excite the hatred of men against our part, dissemi-
nate strange slanders among the people. 12] Having thus excited the minds of good 
men, they have first given occasion to this controversy, and now endeavor, by the 
same arts, to increase the discord. 13] For Your Imperial Majesty will undoubtedly 
find that the form of doctrine and of ceremonies with us is not so intolerable as 
these ungodly and malicious men represent. 14] Besides, the truth cannot be gath-
ered from common rumors or the revilings of enemies. 15] But it can readily be 
judged that nothing would serve better to maintain the dignity of ceremonies, and 
to nourish reverence and pious devotion among the people than if the ceremonies 
were observed rightly in the churches.
The Augsburg Confession

Article XXII: Of Both Kinds in the Sacrament.
1] To the laity are given Both Kinds in the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, because 
this usage has the commandment of the Lord in Matt. 26:27: Drink ye all of it, 2] 
where Christ has manifestly commanded concerning the cup that all should drink. 
3] And lest any man should craftily say that this refers only to priests, Paul in 1 
Cor. 11:27 recites an example from which it appears that the whole congregation 
did use both kinds. 4] And this usage has long remained in the Church, nor is it 
known when, or by whose authority, it was changed; although Cardinal Cusanus 
mentions the time 5] when it was approved. Cyprian in some places testifies that 
the blood was given to the people. 6] The same is testified by Jerome, who says: The 
priests administer the Eucharist, and distribute the blood of Christ to the people. 
Indeed, Pope Gelasius 7] commands that the Sacrament be not divided (dist. II., 
De Consecratione, cap. Comperimus). 8] Only custom, not so ancient, has it oth-
erwise. But it is evident 9] that any custom introduced against the commandments 
of God is not to be allowed, as the Canons witness (dist. III., cap. Veritate, and 
the following chapters). 10] But this custom has been received, not only against 
the Scripture, but also against the old Canons 11] and the example of the Church. 
Therefore, if any preferred to use both kinds of the Sacrament, they ought not 
to have been compelled with offense to their consciences to do otherwise. And 
because the division 12] of the Sacrament does not agree with the ordinance of 
Christ, we are accustomed to omit the procession, which hitherto has been in use. 
Article XXIII: Of the Marriage of Priests.
1] There has been common complaint concerning the examples of priests who were 
not chaste. 2] For that reason also Pope Pius is reported to have said that there 
were certain causes why marriage was taken away from priests, but that there were 
far weightier ones why it ought to be given back; for so Platina writes. 3] Since, 
therefore, our priests were desirous to avoid these open scandals, they married 
wives, and taught that it was lawful for them to contract matrimony. First, because 
4] Paul says, 1 Cor. 7:2,9: To avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife. 
Also: It is better to marry than to burn. Secondly 5] Christ says, Matt. 19:11: All 
men cannot receive this saying, where He teaches that not all men are fit to lead 
a single life; for God created man for procreation, Gen. 1:28. 6] Nor is it in man’s 
power, without a singular gift and work of God, to alter this creation. [For it is 
manifest, and many have confessed that no good, honest, chaste life, no Christian, 
sincere, upright conduct has resulted (from the attempt), but a horrible, fearful 
unrest and torment of conscience has been felt by many until the end.] Therefore, 
The Lutheran Confessions
30
7] those who are not fit to lead a single life ought to 8] contract matrimony. For no 
man’s law, no vow, can annul the commandment and ordinance of God. For these 
reasons 9] the priests teach that it is lawful for them to marry wives.
10] It is also evident that in the ancient Church priests were married men. 11] For 
Paul says, 1 Tim. 3:2, that a bishop should be chosen who is the husband of one 
wife. 12] And in Germany, four hundred years ago for the first time, the priests 
were violently compelled to lead a single life, who indeed offered such resistance 
that the Archbishop of Mayence, when about to publish the Pope’s decree concern-
ing this matter, was almost killed in the tumult raised by the enraged priests. 13] 
And so harsh was the dealing in the matter that not only were marriages forbidden 
for the future, but also existing marriages were torn asunder, contrary to all laws, 
divine and human, contrary even to the Canons themselves, made not only by the 
Popes, but by most celebrated Synods. [Moreover, many God-fearing and intelli-
gent people in high station are known frequently to have expressed misgivings that 
such enforced celibacy and depriving men of marriage (which God Himself has in-
stituted and left free to men) has never produced any good results, but has brought 
on many great and evil vices and much iniquity.]
14] Seeing also that, as the world is aging, man’s nature is gradually growing weak-
er, it is well to guard that no more vices steal into Germany.
15] Furthermore, God ordained marriage to be a help against human infirmity. 
16] The Canons themselves say that the old rigor ought now and then, in the latter 
times, to be relaxed because of the weakness of men; which it is to be wished were 
done also in this matter. 17] And it is to be expected that the churches shall at 
some time lack pastors if marriage is any longer forbidden.
18] But while the commandment of God is in force, while the custom of the 
Church is well known, while impure celibacy causes many scandals, adulteries, and 
other crimes deserving the punishments of just magistrates, yet it is a marvelous 
thing that in nothing is more cruelty exercised than against 19] the marriage of 
priests. God has given commandment to honor marriage. By the laws of all 20] 
well-ordered commonwealths, even among the heathen, marriage is most highly 
honored. 21] But now men, and that, priests, are cruelly put to death, contrary to 
the intent of the Canons, for no other cause than 22] marriage. Paul, in 1 Tim. 4:3, 
calls that a doctrine of devils which forbids marriage. 23] This may now be readily 
understood when the law against marriage is maintained by such penalties.
24] But as no law of man can annul the commandment of God, so neither can it be 
done by any vow. 25] Accordingly, Cyprian also advises that women who do not 
The Augsburg Confession
31
keep the chastity they have promised should marry. His words are these (Book I, 
Epistle XI): But if they be unwilling or unable to persevere, it is better for them to 
marry than to fall into the fire by their lusts; they should certainly give no offense 
to their brethren and sisters.
26] And even the Canons show some leniency toward those who have taken vows 
before the proper age, as heretofore has generally been the case.
Article XXIV: Of the Mass.
1] Falsely are our churches accused of abolishing the Mass; for the Mass is retained 
among 2] us, and celebrated with the highest reverence. Nearly all the usual cere-
monies are also preserved, save that the parts sung in Latin are interspersed here 
and there with German hymns, which have been added 3] to teach the people. For 
ceremonies are needed to this end alone that the unlearned 4] be taught [what they 
need to know of Christ]. And not only has Paul commanded to use in the church 
a language understood by the people 1 Cor. 14:2-9, but it has also been so ordained 
by man’s law. 5] The people are accustomed to partake of the Sacrament together, 
if any be fit for it, and this also increases the reverence and devotion of public 6] 
worship. For none are admitted 7] except they be first examined. The people are 
also advised concerning the dignity and use of the Sacrament, how great consola-
tion it brings anxious consciences, that they may learn to believe God, and to ex-
pect and ask of Him all that is good. 8] [In this connection they are also instructed 
regarding other and false teachings on the Sacrament.] This worship pleases God; 
such use of the Sacrament nourishes true devotion 9] toward God. It does not, 
therefore, appear that the Mass is more devoutly celebrated among our adversaries 
than among us.
10] But it is evident that for a long time this also has been the public and most 
grievous complaint of all good men that Masses have been basely profaned and 
applied to purposes of lucre. 11] For it is not unknown how far this abuse obtains 
in all the churches by what manner of men Masses are said only for fees or sti-
pends, and how many celebrate them contrary to the Canons. 12] But Paul severely 
threatens those who deal unworthily with the Eucharist when he says, 1 Cor. 11:27: 
Whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall 
be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 13] When, therefore our priests were 
admonished concerning this sin, Private Masses were discontinued among us, as 
scarcely any Private Masses were celebrated except for lucre’s sake.
The Lutheran Confessions
32
14] Neither were the bishops ignorant of these abuses, and if they had corrected 
them in time, there would now be less dissension. Heretofore, 15] by their own 
connivance, they suffered many corruptions to creep into the Church. Now, when 
it is too late, they begin to complain 16] of the troubles of the Church, while this 
disturbance has been occasioned simply by those abuses which were so manifest 
that they could be borne no longer. There have been great 17] dissensions concern-
ing the Mass, concerning the Sacrament. 18] Perhaps the world is being punished 
for such long-continued profanations of the Mass as have been tolerated in the 
churches for so many centuries by the very men who 19] were both able and in 
duty bound to correct them. For in the Ten Commandments it is written, Ex. 20:7: 
The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain. But since 20] 
the world began, nothing that God ever ordained seems to have been so abused for 
filthy lucre as the Mass.
21] There was also added the opinion which infinitely increased Private Masses, 
namely that Christ, by His passion, had made satisfaction for original sin, and 
instituted the Mass wherein an offering should be made for daily sins, 22] venial 
and mortal. From this has arisen the common opinion that the Mass 23] takes away 
the sins of the living and the dead by the outward act. Then they began to dispute 
whether one Mass said for many were worth as much as special Masses for indi-
viduals, and this brought forth that infinite multitude of Masses. [With this work 
men wished to obtain from God all that they needed, and in the mean time faith in 
Christ and the true worship were forgotten.]
24] Concerning these opinions our teachers have given warning that they de-
part from the Holy Scriptures and diminish the glory of the passion of Christ. 
For Christ’s passion 25] was an oblation and satisfaction, not for original guilt 
only, but also for all other sins, as it is written to the Hebrews 10:10: 26] We are 
sanctified through the offering of Jesus Christ once for all. Also, Hebrews 10:14: 
27] By one offering He hath perfected forever them that are sanctified. [It is an 
unheard-of innovation in the Church to teach that Christ by His death made 
satisfaction only for original sin and not likewise for all other sin. Accordingly 
it is hoped that everybody will understand that this error has not been reproved 
without due reason.]
28] Scripture also teaches that we are justified before God through faith in Christ, 
when we believe that our sins are forgiven for Christ’s sake. 29] Now if the Mass 
take away the sins of the living and the dead by the outward act justification comes 
of the work of Masses, and not of faith, which Scripture does not allow.
The Augsburg Confession
33
30] But Christ commands us, Luke 22:19: This do in remembrance of Me; there-
fore the Mass was instituted that the faith of those who use the Sacrament should 
remember what benefits it receives through Christ, and cheer and comfort the 
anxious conscience. For to remember Christ is to remember His benefits, 31] and 
to realize that they are truly offered unto us. 32] Nor is it enough only to remem-
ber the history; for this also the Jews and the ungodly can remember. 33] Where-
fore the Mass is to be used to this end, that there the Sacrament [Communion] may 
be administered to them that have need of consolation; as Ambrose says: Because 
I always sin, I am always bound to take the medicine. [Therefore this Sacrament 
requires faith, and is used in vain without faith.]
34] Now, forasmuch as the Mass is such a giving of the Sacrament, we hold one 
communion every holy-day, and, if any desire the Sacrament, also on other days, 
when it is given to such as ask for it. 35] And this custom is not new in the Church; 
for the Fathers before Gregory make no mention of any private Mass, but of the 
common Mass [the Communion] they speak very much. Chrysostom says 36] that 
the priest stands daily at the altar, inviting some 37] to the Communion and keep-
ing back others. And it appears from the ancient Canons that some one celebrated 
the Mass from whom all the other presbyters and deacons received the body of he 
Lord; for thus 38] the words of the Nicene Canon say: Let the deacons, according 
to their order, receive the Holy Communion after the presbyters, from the bishop 
or from a presbyter. 39] And Paul, 1 Cor. 11:33, commands concerning the Commu-
nion: Tarry one for another, so that there may be a common participation.
40] Forasmuch, therefore, as the Mass with us has the example of the Church, 
taken from the Scripture and the Fathers, we are confident that it cannot be 
disapproved, especially since public ceremonies, for the most part like those hither 
to in use, are retained; only the number of Masses differs, which, because of very 
great and manifest abuses doubtless might be profitably reduced. 41] For in olden 
times, even in churches most frequented, the Mass was not celebrated every day, 
as the Tripartite History (Book 9, chap. 33) testifies: Again in Alexandria, every 
Wednesday and Friday the Scriptures are read, and the doctors expound them, and 
all things are done, except the solemn rite of Communion. 
Article XXV: Of Confession.
1] Confession in the churches is not abolished among us; for it is not usual to 
give the body of the Lord, except to them that have been previously examined 
and absolved. And 2] the people are most carefully taught concerning faith in the 
absolution, about which formerly there 3] was profound silence. Our people are 
The Lutheran Confessions
34
taught that they should highly prize the absolution, as being the voice of God, 4] 
and pronounced by God’s command. The power of the Keys is set forth in its beau-
ty and they are reminded what great consolation it brings to anxious consciences, 
also, that God requires faith to believe such absolution as a voice sounding from 
heaven, and that such faith in Christ truly obtains and receives the forgiveness of 
sins. Aforetime satisfactions were immoderately extolled; 5] of faith and the merit 
of Christ and the righteousness of faith no mention was made; wherefore, on this 
point, our churches are by no means to be blamed. For this even our adversaries 
must needs concede 6] to us that the doctrine concerning repentance has been 
most diligently treated and laid open by our teachers.
7] But of Confession they teach that an enumeration of sins is not necessary, 
and that consciences be not burdened with anxiety to enumerate all sins, for it 
is impossible to recount all sins, as the Psalm 19:13 testifies: Who can understand 
his errors? Also Jeremiah 17:9 : 8] The heart is deceitful; who can know it? But if 
no sins were forgiven, except those that are recounted, 9] consciences could never 
find peace; for very many sins they neither see 10] nor can remember. The an-
cient writers also testify that an enumeration is not necessary. For in the Decrees, 
Chrysostom is quoted, 11] who says thus: I say not to you that you should disclose 
yourself in public, nor that you accuse yourself before others, but I would have you 
obey the prophet who says: “Disclose thy way before God.” Therefore confess your 
sins before God, the true Judge, with prayer. Tell your errors, not with the tongue, 
but with the memory of your conscience, etc. 12] And the Gloss (Of Repentance, 
Distinct. V, Cap. Consideret) admits that Confession is of human right only [not 
commanded by Scripture, but ordained by the Church]. 13] Nevertheless, on 
account of the great benefit of absolution, and because it is otherwise useful to the 
conscience, Confession is retained among us. 
Article XXVI: Of the Distinction of Meats.
1] It has been the general persuasion, not of the people alone, but also of those 
teaching in the churches, that making Distinctions of Meats, and like traditions of 
men, are works profitable to merit grace, and able to make satisfactions for sins. 
And that 2] the world so thought, appears from this, that new ceremonies, new 
orders, new holy-days, and new fastings were daily instituted, and the teachers in 
the churches did exact these works as a service necessary to merit grace, and did 
greatly terrify men’s consciences, if they should omit any of these things. 3] From 
this persuasion concerning traditions much detriment has resulted in the Church.
The Augsburg Confession
35
4] First, the doctrine of grace and of the righteousness of faith has been obscured 
by it, which is the chief part of the Gospel, and ought to stand out as the most 
prominent in the Church, in order that the merit of Christ may be well known, 
and faith, which believes that sins are forgiven for Christ’s sake be exalted far 
above works. Wherefore Paul also lays 5] the greatest stress on this article, putting 
aside the Law and human traditions, in order to show that Christian righteous-
ness is something else than such works, to wit, the faith which believes that sins 
6] are freely forgiven for Christ’s sake. But this doctrine of Paul has been almost 
wholly smothered by traditions, which have produced an opinion that, by making 
distinctions in meats and like services, 7] we must merit grace and righteousness. 
In treating of repentance, there was no mention made of faith; only those works of 
satisfaction were set forth; in these the entire repentance seemed to consist.
8] Secondly, these traditions have obscured the commandments of God, because 
traditions were placed far above the commandments of God. Christianity was 
thought to consist wholly in the observance of certain holy-days, rites, fasts, and 
vestures. These 9] observances had won for themselves the exalted title of being the 
spiritual life and the perfect life. Meanwhile the commandments of God, according 
to 10] each one’s calling, were without honor namely, that the father brought up 
his offspring, that the mother bore children, that the prince governed the com-
monwealth,—these were accounted works that were worldly and imperfect, and far 
below those glittering observances. And this error greatly tormented 11] devout 
consciences, which grieved that they were held in an imperfect state of life, as in 
marriage, in the office of magistrate; or in other civil ministrations; on the other 
hand, they admired the monks and such like, and falsely imagined that the obser-
vances of such men were more acceptable to God.
12] Thirdly, traditions brought great danger to consciences; for it was impossible 
to keep all traditions, and yet men judged these observances to be necessary acts 
of worship. Gerson writes that many fell 13] into despair, and that some even took 
their own lives, because they felt that they were not able to satisfy the traditions, 
and they had all the while not heard any consolation of the righteousness of faith 
and 14] grace. We see that the summists and theologians gather the traditions, 
and seek mitigations whereby to ease consciences, and yet they do not sufficient-
ly unfetter, but sometimes entangle, consciences even more. 15] And with the 
gathering of these traditions, the schools and sermons have been so much occu-
pied that they have had no leisure to touch upon Scripture, and to seek the more 
profitable doctrine of faith, of the cross, of hope, of the dignity of civil affairs of 
consolation of sorely tried consciences. 16] Hence Gerson and some other theo-
logians have grievously complained that by these strivings concerning traditions 
they were prevented from giving attention to a better kind of doctrine. Augustine 
The Lutheran Confessions
36
also forbids that men’s consciences should be burdened 17] with such observances, 
and prudently advises Januarius that he must know that they are to be observed as 
things indifferent; for such are his words.
18] Wherefore our teachers must not be looked upon as having taken up this 
matter rashly or from hatred of the bishops, 19] as some falsely suspect. There was 
great need to warn the churches of these errors, which had arisen from misunder-
standing the traditions. 20] For the Gospel compels us to insist in the churches 
upon the doctrine of grace, and of the righteousness of faith; which, however, 
cannot be understood, if men think that they merit grace by observances of their 
own choice.
21] Thus, therefore, they have taught that by the observance of human traditions 
we cannot merit grace or be justified, and hence we must not think such obser-
vances necessary acts of worship. 22] They add hereunto testimonies of Scripture. 
Christ, Matt. 15:3, defends the Apostles who had not observed the usual tradition, 
which, however, evidently pertains to a matter not unlawful, but indifferent, and 
to have a certain affinity with the purifications of the Law, and says, Matt. 15:9, In 
vain do they worship Me with the commandments of men. 23] He, therefore, does 
not exact an unprofitable service. Shortly after He adds: Not that which goeth 
into the mouth defileth a man. So also Paul, Rom. 14:17: 24] The kingdom of God 
is not meat and drink. 25] Col. 2:16: Let no man, therefore, judge you in meat, or 
in drink, or in respect of an holy-day, or of the Sabbath-day; also: If 26] ye be dead 
with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, 
are ye subject to ordinances: Touch not, taste not, handle not! And Peter says, Acts 
15:10: Why 27] tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which 
neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace 
of the Lord Jesus Christ 28] we shall be saved, even as they. Here Peter forbids to 
burden the consciences with many rites, 29] either of Moses or of others. And in 
1 Tim. 4:1,3 Paul calls the prohibition of meats a doctrine of devils; for it is against 
the Gospel to institute or to do such works that by them we may merit grace, or as 
though Christianity could not exist without such service of God.
30] Here our adversaries object that our teachers are opposed to discipline and 
mortification of the flesh, as Jovinian. But the contrary may be learned 31] from 
the writings of our teachers. For they have always taught concerning the cross 
that it behooves Christians to bear afflictions. This is the true, 32] earnest, and 
unfeigned mortification, to wit, to be exercised with divers afflictions, and to be 
crucified with Christ.
The Augsburg Confession
37
33] Moreover, they teach that every Christian ought to train and subdue himself 
with bodily restraints, or bodily exercises and labors that neither satiety nor sloth-
fulness tempt him to sin, but not that we may merit grace or make satisfaction for 
sins by such exercises. 34] And such external discipline ought to be urged at all 
times, not only on a few and set days. So Christ commands, 35] Luke 21:34: Take 
heed lest your hearts 36] be overcharged with surfeiting; also Matt. 17:21: This kind 
goeth not out but 37] by prayer and fasting. Paul also says, 1 Cor. 9:27: I keep under 
my body and bring it into subjection. 38] Here he clearly shows that he was keep-
ing under his body, not to merit forgiveness of sins by that discipline, but to have 
his body in subjection and fitted for spiritual things, and for the discharge of duty 
according 39] to his calling. Therefore, we do not condemn fasting in itself, but the 
traditions which prescribe certain days and certain meats, with peril of conscience, 
as though such works were a necessary service.
40] Nevertheless, very many traditions are kept on our part, which conduce to 
good order in the Church, as the Order of Lessons 41] in the Mass and the chief 
holy-days. But, at the same time, men are warned that such observances do not 
justify before God, and that in such things it should not be made sin if they be 
omitted without offense. 42] Such liberty in human rites was not unknown to 
the Fathers. 43] For in the East they kept Easter at another time than at Rome, 
and when, on account of this diversity, the Romans accused the Eastern Church 
of schism, they were admonished by others 44] that such usages need not be alike 
everywhere. And Irenaeus says: Diversity concerning fasting does not destroy the 
harmony of faith; as also Pope Gregory intimates in Dist. XII, that such diversity 
does not violate the unity of the Church. 45] And in the Tripartite History, Book 
9, many examples of dissimilar rites are gathered, and the following statement is 
made: It was not the mind of the Apostles to enact rules concerning holy-days, but 
to preach godliness and a holy life [to teach faith and love]. 
Article XXVII: Of Monastic Vows.
1] What is taught on our part concerning Monastic Vows, will be better under-
stood if it be remembered what has been the state of the monasteries, and how 
many things were daily done in those very monasteries, contrary to the Canons. 
2] In Augustine’s time they were free associations. Afterward, when discipline was 
corrupted, vows were everywhere added for the purpose of restoring discipline, as 
in a carefully planned prison.
3] Gradually, many other observances were added besides vows. 4] And these fet-
ters were laid upon many before the lawful age, contrary to the Canons.
The Lutheran Confessions
38
5] Many also entered into this kind of life through ignorance, being unable to judge 
their own strength, though they were of sufficient age. 6] Being thus ensnared, they 
were compelled to remain, even though some could have been freed by the kind 
provision of the Canons. 7] And this was more the case in convents of women than 
of monks, although more consideration should have been shown the weaker sex. 
8] This rigor displeased many good men before this time, who saw that young men 
and maidens were thrown into convents for a living. They saw what unfortunate 
results came of this procedure, and what scandals were created, what snares were 
cast upon consciences! They were grieved 9] that the authority of the Canons in 
so momentous a matter was utterly set aside and despised. To 10] these evils was 
added such a persuasion concerning vows as, it is well known, in former times dis-
pleased even those monks who were more considerate. 11] They taught that vows 
were equal to Baptism; they taught that by this kind of life they merited forgive-
ness of sins and justification before God. 12] Yea, they added that the monastic life 
not only merited righteousness before God but even greater things, because it kept 
not only the precepts, but also the so-called “evangelical counsels.”
13] Thus they made men believe that the profession of monasticism was far better 
than Baptism, and that the monastic life was more meritorious than that of magis-
trates, than the life of pastors, and such like, who serve their calling in accordance 
with God’s commands, without any man-made services. 14] None of these things 
can be denied; for they appear in their own books. [Moreover, a person who has 
been thus ensnared and has entered a monastery learns little of Christ.]
15] What, then, came to pass in the monasteries? Aforetime they were schools of 
theology and other branches, profitable to the Church; and thence pastors and 
bishops were obtained. Now it is another thing. It is needless to rehearse what is 
known to all. 16] Aforetime they came together to learn; now they feign that it is a 
kind of life instituted to merit grace and righteousness; yea, they preach that it is a 
state of perfection, and they put it far above all other kinds of life ordained of God. 
17] These things we have rehearsed without odious exaggeration, to the end that 
the doctrine of our teachers on this point might be better understood.
18] First, concerning such as contract matrimony, they teach on our part that it is 
lawful for all men who are not fitted for single life to contract matrimony, because 
vows cannot annul the ordinance and commandment of God. 19] But the com-
mandment of God is 1 Cor. 7:2: To avoid fornication, let every man have 20] his 
own wife. Nor is it the commandment only, but also the creation and ordinance of 
God, which forces those to marry who are not excepted by a singular work of God, 
according to the text Gen. 2:18: It is not good 21] that the man should be alone. 
Therefore they do not sin who obey this commandment and ordinance of God.
The Augsburg Confession
39
22] What objection can be raised to this? Let men extol the obligation of a vow as 
much as they list, yet shall they not bring to pass that the vow 23] annuls the com-
mandment of God. The Canons teach that the right of the superior is excepted in 
every vow; [that vows are not binding against the decision of the Pope;] much less, 
therefore, are these vows of force which are against the commandments of God.
24] Now, if the obligation of vows could not be changed for any cause whatever, 
the Roman Pontiffs could never have given dispensation for it is not lawful for 
man to annul an obligation which is simply 25] divine. But the Roman Pontiffs 
have prudently judged that leniency is to be observed in this obligation, and there-
fore 26] we read that many times they have dispensed from vows. The case of the 
King of Aragon who was called back from the monastery is well known, and there 
are also examples in our own times. [Now, if dispensations have been granted for 
the sake of securing temporal interests, it is much more proper that they be grant-
ed on account of the distress of souls.]
27] In the second place, why do our adversaries exaggerate the obligation or effect 
of a vow when, at the same time, they have not a word to say of the nature of the 
vow itself, that it ought to be in a thing possible, that it ought to be free, 28] and 
chosen spontaneously and deliberately? But it is not unknown to what extent 
perpetual chastity is in the power of man. 29] And how few are there who have 
taken the vow spontaneously and deliberately! Young maidens and men, before 
they are able to judge, are persuaded, and sometimes even compelled, to take the 
vow. Wherefore 30] it is not fair to insist so rigorously on the obligation, since it is 
granted by all that it is against the nature of a vow to take it without spontaneous 
and deliberate action.
31] Most canonical laws rescind vows made before the age of fifteen; for before 
that age there does not seem sufficient judgment in a person to decide concerning 
a perpetual life. 32] Another Canon, granting more to the weakness of man, adds a 
few years; for it forbids a vow to be made before the age of eighteen. 33] But which 
of these two Canons shall we follow? The most part have an excuse for leaving the 
monasteries, because most of them have taken the vows before they reached these 
ages.
34] Finally, even though the violation of a vow might be censured, yet it seems 
not forthwith to follow that the marriages of such persons must be dissolved. 
35] For Augustine denies that they ought to be dissolved (XXVII. Quaest. I, Cap. 
Nuptiarum), and his authority is not lightly to be esteemed, although other men 
afterwards thought otherwise.
The Lutheran Confessions
40
36] But although it appears that God’s command concerning marriage delivers 
very many from their vows, yet our teachers introduce also another argument 
concerning vows to show that they are void. For every service of God, ordained 
and chosen of men without the commandment of God to merit justification and 
grace, is wicked, as Christ says Matt. 15:9: 37] In vain do they worship Me with the 
commandments of men. And Paul teaches everywhere that righteousness is not to 
be sought from our own observances and acts of worship, devised by men, but that 
it comes by faith to those who believe that they are received by God into grace for 
Christ’s sake.
38] But it is evident that monks have taught that services of man’s making satisfy 
for sins and merit grace and justification. What else is this than to detract from the 
glory of Christ and to obscure and deny the righteousness of faith? 39] It follows, 
therefore, that the vows thus commonly taken have been wicked services, and, con-
sequently, are void. 40] For a wicked vow, taken against the commandment of God, 
is not valid; for (as the Canon says) no vow ought to bind men to wickedness.
41] Paul says, Gal. 5:4: Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are 
justified by the Law, ye are fallen from grace. 42] To those, therefore, who want to 
be justified by their vows Christ is made of no effect, and they fall from grace. 43] 
For also these who ascribe justification to vows ascribe to their own works that 
which properly belongs to the glory of Christ.
44] Nor can it be denied, indeed, that the monks have taught that, by their vows 
and observances, they were justified, and merited forgiveness of sins, yea, they 
invented still greater absurdities, saying 45] that they could give others a share 
in their works. If any one should be inclined to enlarge on these things with evil 
intent, how many things could he bring together whereof even the monks are now 
ashamed! 46] Over and above this, they persuaded men that services of man’s mak-
ing were a state of Christian perfection. 47] And is not this assigning justification 
to works? 48] It is no light offense in the Church to set forth to the people a service 
devised by men, without the commandment of God, and to teach that such service 
justifies men. For the righteousness of faith, which chiefly ought to be taught in 
the Church, is obscured when these wonderful angelic forms of worship, with their 
show of poverty, humility, and celibacy, are cast before the eyes of men.
49] Furthermore, the precepts of God and the true service of God are obscured 
when men hear that only monks are in a state of perfection. For Christian perfec-
tion is to fear God from the heart, and yet to conceive great faith, and to trust that 
for Christ’s sake we have a God who has been reconciled, to ask of God, and assur-
edly to expect His aid in all things that, according to our calling, are to be done; 
The Augsburg Confession
41
and meanwhile, to be diligent in outward good works, 50] and to serve our calling. 
In these things consist the true perfection and the true service of God. It does not 
consist in celibacy, or in begging, or in vile apparel. 51] But the people conceive 
many pernicious opinions from the false commendations of monastic life. 52] They 
hear celibacy praised above measure; therefore they lead their married life with 
offense to their consciences. 53] They hear that only beggars are perfect; therefore 
they keep their possessions and do business with offense to their consciences. 54] 
They hear that it is an evangelical counsel not to seek revenge; therefore some in 
private life are not afraid to take revenge, for they hear that it is but a counsel, and 
55] not a commandment. Others judge that the Christian cannot properly hold a 
civil office or be a magistrate.
56] There are on record examples of men who, forsaking marriage and the admin-
istration of the Commonwealth, have hid themselves in monasteries. This 57] they 
called fleeing from the world, and seeking a kind of life which would be more 
pleasing to God. Neither did they see that God ought to be served in those com-
mandments which He Himself has given and not in commandments 58] devised by 
men. A good and perfect kind of life is that which has for it the commandment of 
God. 59] It is necessary to admonish men of these things.
60] And before these times, Gerson rebukes this error of the monks concerning 
perfection, and testifies that in his day it was a new saying that the monastic life is 
a state of perfection.
61] So many wicked opinions are inherent in the vows, namely, that they justify, 
that they constitute Christian perfection, that they keep the counsels and com-
mandments, that they have works of supererogation. All these things, since they 
are false and empty, make vows null and void. 
Article XXVIII: Of Ecclesiastical Power.
1] There has been great controversy concerning the Power of Bishops, in which 
some have awkwardly confounded the power of the Church 2] and the power of 
the sword. And from this confusion very great wars and tumults have resulted, 
while the Pontiffs, emboldened by the power of the Keys, not only have instituted 
new services and burdened consciences with reservation of cases and ruthless ex-
communications, but have also undertaken to transfer the kingdoms of this world, 
3] and to take the Empire from the Emperor. These wrongs have long since been 
rebuked in the Church 4] by learned and godly men. Therefore our teachers, for the 
comforting of men’s consciences, were constrained to show the difference between 
The Lutheran Confessions
42
the power of the Church and the power of the sword, and taught that both of 
them, because of God’s commandment, are to be held in reverence and honor, as 
the chief blessings of God on earth.
5] But this is their opinion, that the power of the Keys, or the power of the bish-
ops, according to the Gospel, is a power or commandment of God, to preach the 
Gospel, to remit and retain sins, and to administer Sacraments. 6] For with this 
commandment Christ sends forth His Apostles, John 20:21 sqq.: As My Father hath 
sent Me, even so send I you. Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whosesoever sins ye remit, 
they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained. 7] 
Mark 16:15: Go preach the Gospel to every creature.
8] This power is exercised only by teaching or preaching the Gospel and adminis-
tering the Sacraments, according to their calling either to many or to individuals. 
For thereby are granted, not bodily, but eternal things, as eternal righteousness, the 
Holy Ghost, eternal life. 9] These things cannot come but by the ministry of the 
Word and the Sacraments, as Paul says, Rom. 1:16: The Gospel is the power of God 
unto salvation to every one that believeth. 10] Therefore, since the power of the 
Church grants eternal things, and is exercised only by the ministry of the Word, it 
does not interfere with civil government; no more than the art of singing interferes 
with civil government. 11] For civil government deals with other things than does 
the Gospel. The civil rulers defend not minds, but bodies and bodily things against 
manifest injuries, and restrain men with the sword and bodily punishments in 
order to preserve civil justice and peace.
12] Therefore the power of the Church and the civil power must not be confound-
ed. The power of the Church has its own commission to teach the Gospel and 13] 
to administer the Sacraments. Let it not break into the office of another; let it not 
transfer the kingdoms of this world; let it not abrogate the laws of civil rulers; let 
it not abolish lawful obedience; let it not interfere with judgments concerning 
civil ordinances or contracts; let it not prescribe laws to civil rulers concerning the 
form of the Commonwealth. 14] As Christ says, John 18:36: My kingdom is not of 
this world; 15] also Luke 12:14: Who made Me a judge or a divider over you? 16] 
Paul also says, Phil. 3:20: Our citizenship is in heaven; 17] 2 Cor. 10:4: The weapons 
of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the casting down of 
imaginations.
18] After this manner our teachers discriminate between the duties of both these 
powers, and command that both be honored and acknowledged as gifts and bless-
ings of God.
The Augsburg Confession
43
19] If bishops have any power of the sword, that power they have, not as bishops, 
by the commission of the Gospel, but by human law having received it of kings and 
emperors for the civil administration of what is theirs. This, however, is another 
office than the ministry of the Gospel.
20] When, therefore, the question is concerning the jurisdiction of bishops, civil 
authority must be distinguished from 21] ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Again, accord-
ing to the Gospel or, as they say, by divine right, there belongs to the bishops as 
bishops, that is, to those to whom has been committed the ministry of the Word 
and the Sacraments, no jurisdiction except to forgive sins, to judge doctrine, to 
reject doctrines contrary to the Gospel, and to exclude from the communion of 
the Church wicked men, whose wickedness is known, and this without human 
force, 22] simply by the Word. Herein the congregations of necessity and by divine 
right must obey them, according to Luke 10:16: He that heareth you heareth Me. 
23] But when they teach or ordain anything against the Gospel, then the congre-
gations have a commandment of God prohibiting obedience, Matt. 7:15: Beware of 
false prophets; 24] Gal. 1:8: Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel, 
let him be accursed; 25] 2 Cor. 13:8: We can do nothing against the truth, but for 
the truth. 26] Also: The power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and 
not to destruction. 27] So, also, the Canonical Laws command (II. Q. VII. Cap., 
Sacerdotes, and Cap. Oves). 28] And Augustine (Contra Petiliani Epistolam): 
Neither must we submit to Catholic bishops if they chance to err, or hold anything 
contrary to the Canonical Scriptures of God.
29] If they have any other power or jurisdiction, in hearing and judging certain 
cases, as of matrimony or of tithes, etc., they have it by human right, in which 
matters princes are bound, even against their will, when the ordinaries fail, to 
dispense justice to their subjects for the maintenance of peace. 30] Moreover, it 
is disputed whether bishops or pastors have the right to introduce ceremonies in 
the Church, and to make laws concerning meats, holy-days and grades, that is, 
orders of ministers, etc. 31] They that give this right to the bishops refer to this 
testimony John 16:12-13: I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear 
them now. Howbeit when He, the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide you into 
all truth. 32] They also refer to the example of the Apostles, who commanded to 
abstain from blood and from things strangled, Acts 15:29. 33] They refer to the 
Sabbath-day as having been changed into the Lord’s Day, contrary to the Decalog, 
as it seems. Neither is there any example whereof they make more than concerning 
the changing of the Sabbath-day. Great, say they, is the power of the Church, since 
it has dispensed with one of the Ten Commandments!
The Lutheran Confessions
44
34] But concerning this question it is taught on our part (as has been shown above) 
that bishops have no power to decree anything against the Gospel. The Canonical 
Laws teach the same thing (Dist. IX). 35] Now, it is against Scripture to establish 
or require the observance of any traditions, to the end that by such observance we 
may make satisfaction for sins, or merit grace and righteousness. 36] For the glory 
of Christ’s merit suffers injury when, by such observances, 37] we undertake to 
merit justification. But it is manifest that, by such belief, traditions have almost 
infinitely multiplied in the Church, the doctrine concerning faith and the righ-
teousness of faith being meanwhile suppressed. For gradually more holy-days were 
made, fasts appointed, new ceremonies and services in honor of saints instituted, 
because the authors of such things thought that by these works they were meriting 
38] grace. Thus in times past the Penitential Canons increased, whereof we still see 
some traces in the satisfactions.
39] Again, the authors of traditions do contrary to the command of God when 
they find matters of sin in foods, in days, and like things, and burden the Church 
with bondage of the law, as if there ought to be among Christians, in order to 
merit justification a service like the Levitical, the arrangement of which God had 
committed to the Apostles and bishops. 40] For thus some of them write; and the 
Pontiffs in some measure seem to be misled by the example 41] of the law of Moses. 
Hence are such burdens, as that they make it mortal sin, even without offense to 
others, to do manual labor on holy-days, a mortal sin to omit the Canonical Hours, 
that certain foods defile the conscience that fastings are works which appease God 
that sin in a reserved case cannot be forgiven but by the authority of him who 
reserved it; whereas the Canons themselves speak only of the reserving of the eccle-
siastical penalty, and not of the reserving of the guilt.
42] Whence have the bishops the right to lay these traditions upon the Church for 
the ensnaring of consciences, when Peter, Acts 15:10, forbids to put a yoke upon 
the neck of the disciples, and Paul says, 2 Cor. 13:10, that the power given him was 
to edification not to destruction? Why, therefore, do they increase sins by these 
traditions?
43] But there are clear testimonies which prohibit the making of such traditions, 
as though they merited grace or were necessary to 44] salvation. Paul says, Col. 
2:16-23: Let no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy-day, 
or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath-days. 45] If ye be dead with Christ from 
the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to 
ordinances (touch not; taste not; handle not, which all are to perish with the using) 
after the commandments and doctrines of men! which things have indeed a show 
The Augsburg Confession
45
of wisdom. 46] Also in Titus 1:14 he openly forbids traditions: Not giving heed to 
Jewish fables and commandments of men that turn from the truth.
47] And Christ, Matt. 15:14,13, says of those who require traditions: Let them alone; 
they be blind leaders of the blind; 48] and He rejects such services: Every plant 
which My heavenly Father hath not planted shall be plucked up.
49] If bishops have the right to burden churches with infinite traditions, and to 
ensnare consciences, why does Scripture so often prohibit to make, and to listen 
to, traditions? Why does it call them “doctrines of devils”? 1 Tim. 4:1. Did the Holy 
Ghost in vain forewarn of these things?
50] Since, therefore, ordinances instituted as things necessary, or with an opinion 
of meriting grace, are contrary to the Gospel, it follows that it is not lawful for any 
bishop 51] to institute or exact such services. For it is necessary that the doctrine 
of Christian liberty be preserved in the churches, namely, that the bondage of the 
Law is not necessary to justification, as it is written in the Epistle to the Galatians 
5:1: Be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. 52] It is necessary that the 
chief article of the Gospel be preserved, to wit, that we obtain grace freely by faith 
in Christ, and not for certain observances or acts of worship devised by men.
53] What, then, are we to think of the Sunday and like rites in the house of God? 
To this we answer that it is lawful for bishops or pastors to make ordinances that 
things be done orderly in the Church, not that thereby we should merit grace or 
make satisfaction for sins, or that consciences be bound to judge them necessary 
services, and to think that it is a sin to break them 54] without offense to others. 
So Paul ordains, 1 Cor. 11:5, that women should cover their heads in the congrega-
tion, 1 Cor. 14:30, that interpreters be heard in order in the church, etc.
55] It is proper that the churches should keep such ordinances for the sake of love 
and tranquillity, so far that one do not offend another, that all things be done in 
the churches in order, and without confusion, 1 Cor. 14:40; comp. Phil. 2:14 . 56] but 
so that consciences be not burdened to think that they are necessary to salvation, 
or to judge that they sin when they break them without offense to others; as no one 
will say that a woman sins who goes out in public with her head uncovered provid-
ed only that no offense be given.
57] Of this kind is the observance of the Lord’s Day, Easter, Pentecost, and like 
holy-days and 58] rites. For those who judge that by the authority of the Church 
the observance of the Lord’s Day instead of the Sabbath-day was ordained as a 
thing necessary, 59] do greatly err. Scripture has abrogated the Sabbath-day; for it 
The Lutheran Confessions
46
teaches that, since the Gospel has been revealed, all the ceremonies of Moses can 
be omitted. And 60] yet, because it was necessary to appoint a certain day, that the 
people might know when they ought to come together, it appears that the Church 
designated the Lord’s Day for this purpose; and this day seems to have been chosen 
all the more for this additional reason, that men might have an example of Chris-
tian liberty, and might know that the keeping neither of the Sabbath nor of any 
other day is necessary.
61] There are monstrous disputations concerning the changing of the law, the 
ceremonies of the new law, the changing of the Sabbath-day, which all have sprung 
from the false belief that there must needs be in the Church a service like to the Le-
vitical, and that Christ had given commission to the Apostles and bishops to devise 
new ceremonies as necessary to 62] salvation. These errors crept into the Church 
when the righteousness of faith was not taught clearly enough. 63]Some dispute 
that the keeping of the Lord’s Day is not indeed of divine right, but in a manner so. 
They prescribe concerning holy-days, how far it is lawful to work. What else 64] are 
such disputations than snares of consciences? For although they endeavor to mod-
ify the traditions, yet the mitigation can never be perceived as long as the opinion 
remains that they are necessary, which must needs remain where the righteousness 
of faith and Christian liberty are not known.
65] The Apostles commanded Acts 15:20 to abstain from blood. Who does now ob-
serve it? And yet they that do it not sin not; for not even the Apostles themselves 
wanted to burden consciences with such bondage; but they forbade it for a time, to 
avoid offense. 66] For in this decree we must perpetually consider what the aim of 
the Gospel is.
67] Scarcely any Canons are kept with exactness, and from day to day many go 
out of use even among those who are the most zealous advocates of traditions. 68] 
Neither can due regard be paid to consciences unless this mitigation be observed, 
that we know that the Canons are kept without holding them to be necessary, and 
that no harm is done consciences, even though traditions go out of use.
69] But the bishops might easily retain the lawful obedience of the people if they 
would not insist upon the observance of such traditions as cannot be kept with a 
good conscience. 70] Now they command celibacy; they admit none unless they 
swear that they will not teach 71] the pure doctrine of the Gospel. The churches 
do not ask that the bishops should restore concord at the expense of their honor; 
which, nevertheless, 72] it would be proper for good pastors to do. They ask only 
that they would release unjust burdens which are new and have been received 
The Augsburg Confession
47
contrary to the custom of the Church Catholic. 73] It may be that in the begin-
ning there were plausible reasons for some of these ordinances; and yet they are 
not adapted to later times. 74] It is also evident that some were adopted through 
erroneous conceptions. Therefore it would be befitting the clemency of the Pontiffs 
to mitigate them now, because such a modification does not shake the unity of the 
Church. For many human traditions have been changed in process of time, 75] as 
the Canons themselves show. But if it be impossible to obtain a mitigation of such 
observances as cannot be kept without sin, we are bound to follow the apostolic 
rule, Acts 5:29, which commands us to obey God rather than men.
76] Peter, 1 Pet. 5:3, forbids bishops to be lords, and to rule over the churches. 77] 
It is not our design now to wrest the government from the bishops, but this one 
thing is asked, namely, that they allow the Gospel to be purely taught, and that 
they relax some few observances which 78] cannot be kept without sin. But if they 
make no concession, it is for them to see how they shall give account to God for 
furnishing, by their obstinacy, a cause for schism.
Conclusion.
1] These are the chief articles which seem to be in controversy. For although we 
might have spoken of more abuses, yet, to avoid undue length, we have set forth 
the chief points, from which the rest may be readily judged. 2] There have been 
great complaints concerning indulgences, pilgrimages, and the abuse of excommu-
nications. The parishes have been vexed in many ways by the dealers in indulgenc-
es. There were endless contentions between the pastors and the monks concerning 
the parochial right, confessions, burials, sermons on extraordinary occasions, 
and 3] innumerable other things. Issues of this sort we have passed over so that 
the chief points in this matter, having been briefly set forth, might be the more 
readily understood. 4] Nor has anything been here said or adduced to the reproach 
of any one. 5] Only those things have been recounted whereof we thought that it 
was necessary to speak, in order that it might be understood that in doctrine and 
ceremonies nothing has been received on our part against Scripture or the Church 
Catholic. For it is manifest that we have taken most diligent care that no new and 
ungodly doctrine should creep into our churches.
6] The above articles we desire to present in accordance with the edict of Your 
Imperial Majesty, in order to exhibit our Confession and let men see a summary 
of the doctrine of our teachers. 7] If there is anything that any one might desire in

ing to the Scriptures.

Philip Melanchthon Presents His Greeting to the Reader.
1] After the Confession of our princes had been publicly read, certain theologians 
and monks prepared a confutation of our writing; and when His Imperial Majesty 
had caused this also to be read in the assembly of the princes, he demanded of our 
princes that they should assent to this Confutation.
2] But as our princes had heard that many articles were disapproved, which they 
could not abandon without offense to conscience, they asked that a copy of the 
Confutation be furnished them, that they might be able both to see what the ad-
versaries condemned, and to refute their arguments.
And, indeed, in a cause of such importance pertaining to religion and the instruc-
tion of consciences, they thought that the adversaries would produce their writing 
without any hesitation [, or even offer it to us].
But this our princes could not obtain, unless on the most perilous conditions, 
which it was impossible for them to accept.
3] Then, too, negotiations for peace were begun, in which it was apparent that 
our princes declined no burden, however grievous, that could be assumed without 
offense to conscience. 4] But the adversaries obstinately demanded this, namely, 
that we should approve certain manifest abuses and errors; and as we could not do 
this, His Imperial Majesty again demanded that our princes should assent to the 
Confutation. This our princes refused to do.
For in a matter pertaining to religion, how could they assent to a writing into 
which they had not looked, especially, as they had heard that some articles were 
condemned, in which it was impossible for them, without grievous sin, to approve 
the opinions of the adversaries?
5] They had, however, commanded me and some others to prepare an Apology of the 
Confession, in which the reasons why we could not receive the Confutation should 
be set forth to His Imperial Majesty, and the objections made by the adversaries 
should be refuted. 6] For during the reading some of us had taken down the chief 
points 7] of the topics and arguments. This Apology they finally [at last when they 
took their departure from Augsburg] offered to His Imperial Majesty, that he 
might know that we were hindered by the greatest and most important reasons 
The Lutheran Confessions
50
from approving the Confutation. But His Imperial Majesty did not receive the 
offered writing.
8] Afterwards a certain decree was published, in which the adversaries boast that 
they have refuted our Confession from the Scriptures.
9] You have now, therefore, reader, our Apology, from which you will understand 
not only what the adversaries have judged (for we have reported in good faith), but 
also that they have condemned several articles contrary to the manifest Scripture 
of the Holy Ghost so far are they from overthrowing our propositions by means of 
the Scriptures.
10] Now, although originally we drew up the Apology by taking counsel with 
others, nevertheless, as it passed through the press, I have made some additions. 
Wherefore I give my name, so that no one can complain that the book has been 
published anonymously.
11] It has always been my custom in these controversies to retain, so far as I was at 
all able, the form of the customarily received doctrine, in order that at some time 
concord could be reached the more readily. Nor, indeed, am I now departing far 
from this custom, although I could justly lead away the men of this age still farther 
from the opinions of the adversaries.
12] But the adversaries are treating the case in such a way as to show that they are 
seeking neither truth nor concord, but to drain our blood.
13] And now I have written with the greatest moderation possible; and if any 
expression appears too severe, I must say here beforehand that I am contending 
with the theologians and monks who wrote the Confutation, and not with the 
Emperor or the princes, 14] whom I hold in due esteem. But I have recently seen 
the Confutation, and have noticed how cunningly and slanderously it was written, 
so that on some points it could deceive even the cautious.
15] Yet I have not discussed all their sophistries, for it would be an endless task; 
but I have comprised the chief arguments, that there might be among all nations 
a testimony concerning us that we hold the Gospel 16] of Christ correctly and in 
a pious way. Discord does not delight us, neither are we indifferent to our danger; 
for we readily understand the extent of it in such a bitterness of hatred wherewith 
we see that the adversaries have been inflamed. But we cannot abandon truth that 
is manifest and necessary to the Church.
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
51
Wherefore we believe that troubles and dangers for the glory of Christ and the 
good of the Church should be endured, and we are confident that this our fidelity 
to duty is approved of God, and we hope that the judgment of posterity concern-
ing us will be more just.
17] For it is undeniable that many topics of Christian doctrine whose existence 
in the Church is of the greatest moment have been brought to view by our 
theologians and explained; in reference to which we are not disposed here to 
recount under what sort of opinions, and how dangerous, they formerly lay 
covered in the writings of the monks, canonists, and sophistical theologians. [This 
may have to be done later.]
18] We have the public testimonials of many good men, who give God thanks for 
this greatest blessing, namely, that concerning many necessary topics it has taught 
better things than are read everywhere in the books of our adversaries.
19] We shall commend our cause, therefore, to Christ, who some time will judge 
these controversies, and we beseech Him to look upon the afflicted and scattered 
churches, and to bring them back to godly and perpetual concord. [Therefore, if 
the known and clear truth is trodden under foot, we will resign this cause to God 
and Christ in heaven, who is the Father of orphans and the Judge of widows and 
of all the forsaken, who (as we certainly know) will judge and pass sentence upon 
this cause aright. Lord Jesus Christ it is Thy holy Gospel, it is Thy cause; look Thou 
upon the many troubled hearts and consciences, and maintain and strengthen in 
Thy truth Thy churches and little flocks, who suffer anxiety and distress from the 
devil. Confound all hypocrisy and lies, and grant peace and unity, so that Thy glory 
may advance, and Thy kingdom, strong against all the gates of hell, may continually 
grow and increase.]
Article I: Of God.
1] The First Article of our Confession our adversaries approve, in which we declare 
that we believe and teach that there is one divine essence, undivided, etc., and yet, 
that there are three distinct persons, of the same divine essence, and coeternal, 
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 2] This article we have always taught and defended, 
and we believe that it has, in Holy Scripture, sure and firm testimonies that cannot 
be overthrown. And we constantly affirm that those thinking otherwise are outside 
of the Church of Christ. and are idolaters, and insult God.
The Lutheran Confessions
52
Article II (I): Of Original Sin.
1] The Second Article, Of Original Sin, the adversaries approve, but in such a way 
that they, nevertheless, censure the definition of original sin, which we incidentally 
gave. Here, immediately at the very threshold, His Imperial Majesty will discover 
that the writers of the Confutation were deficient not only in judgment, but also 
in candor. For whereas we, with a simple mind, desired, in passing, to recount 
those things which original sin embraces, these men, by framing an invidious 
interpretation, artfully distort a proposition that has in it nothing which of itself is 
wrong. Thus they say: “To be without the fear of God, to be without faith, is actual 
guilt;” and therefore they deny that it is original guilt.
2] It is quite evident that such subtilties have originated in the schools, not in the 
council of the Emperor. But although this sophistry can be very easily refuted; yet, 
in order that all good men may understand that we teach in this matter nothing 
that is absurd, we ask first of all that the German Confession be examined. This 
will free us from the suspicion of novelty. For there it is written: Weiter wird 
gelehrt, dass nach dem Fall Adams alle Menschen, so natuerlich geboren werden, 
in Suenden empfangen und geboren werden, das ist, dass sie alle von Mutterleibe 
an voll boeser Lueste und Neigung sind, keine wahre Gottesfurcht, keinen wahren 
Glauben an Gott von Natur haben koennen. [It is further taught that since the Fall 
of Adam all men who are naturally born are conceived and born in sin, i.e., that 
they all, from their mother’s womb, are full of evil desire and inclination, and can 
have by nature no true fear of God, no true faith in God.] 3] This passage testifies 
that we deny to those propagated according to carnal nature not only the acts, 
but also the power or gifts of producing fear and trust in God. For we say that 
those thus born have concupiscence, and cannot produce true fear and trust in 
God. What is there here with which fault can be found? To good men, we think, 
indeed, that we have exculpated ourselves sufficiently. For in this sense the Latin 
description denies to nature [even to innocent infants] the power, i.e., it denies the 
gifts and energy by which to produce fear and trust in God, and, in adults [over 
and above this innate evil disposition of the heart, also] the acts, so that, when we 
mention concupiscence, we understand not only the acts or fruits, but the constant 
inclination of the nature [the evil inclination within, which does not cease as long 
as we are not born anew through the Spirit and faith].
4] But hereafter we will show more fully that our description agrees with the usual 
and ancient definition. For we must first show our design in preferring to employ 
these words in this place. In their schools the adversaries confess that “the mate-
rial,” as they call it, “of original sin is concupiscence.” Wherefore, in framing the 
definition, this should not have been passed by, especially at this time, when some 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
53
are philosophizing concerning it in a manner unbecoming teachers of religion [are 
speaking concerning this innate, wicked desire more after the manner of heathen 
from philosophy than according to God’s Word, or Holy Scripture].
5] For some contend that original sin is not a depravity or corruption in the nature 
of man, but only servitude, or a condition of mortality [not an innate evil nature, 
but only a blemish or imposed load, or burden], which those propagated from 
Adam bear because of the guilt of another [namely, Adam’s sin], and without any 
depravity of their own. Besides, they add that no one is condemned to eternal 
death on account of original sin, just as those who are born of a bond-woman are 
slaves, and bear this condition without any natural blemish, but because of the ca-
lamity of their mother [while, of themselves, they are born without fault, like other 
men: thus original sin is not an innate evil, but a defect and burden which we bear 
since Adam, but we are not on that account personally in sin and inherited dis-
grace]. 6] To show that this impious opinion is displeasing to us, we made mention 
of “concupiscence,” and, with the best intention, have termed and explained it as 
“diseases,” that “the nature of men is born corrupt and full of faults” [not a part of 
man, but the entire person with its entire nature is born in sin as with a hereditary 
disease]
7] Nor, indeed, have we only made use of the term concupiscence, but we have 
also said that “the fear of God and faith are wanting.” This we have added with 
the following design: The scholastic teachers also, not sufficiently understanding 
the definition of original sin, which they have received from the Fathers, extenu-
ate the sin of origin. They contend concerning the fomes [or evil inclination] that 
it is a quality of [blemish in the] body, and, with their usual folly, ask whether 
this quality be derived from the contagion of the apple or from the breath of the 
serpent, and whether it be increased by remedies. With such questions they have 
suppressed the main point. 8] Therefore, when they speak of the sin of origin, they 
do not mention the more serious faults of human nature, to wit, ignorance of God, 
contempt for God, being destitute of fear and confidence in God, hatred of God’s 
judgment, flight from God [as from a tyrant] when He judges, anger toward God, 
despair of grace, putting one’s trust in present things [money, property, friends], 
etc. These diseases, which are in the highest degree contrary to the Law of God, the 
scholastics do not notice; yea, to human nature they meanwhile ascribe unimpaired 
strength for loving God above all things, and for fulfilling God’s commandments 
according to the substance of the acts, nor do they see 9] that they are saying things 
that are contradictory to one another. For what else is the being able in one’s own 
strength to love God above all things, and to fulfil His commandments, than to 
have original righteousness [to be a new creature in Paradise, entirely pure and 
holy]? 10] But if human nature have such strength as to be able of itself to love God 
The Lutheran Confessions
54
above all things as the scholastics confidently affirm, what will original sin be? For 
what will there be need of the grace of Christ if we can be justified by our own 
righteousness [powers]? For what will there be need of the Holy Ghost if human 
strength can by itself 11] love God above all things, and fulfil God’s command-
ments? Who does not see what preposterous thoughts our adversaries entertain? 
The lighter diseases in the nature of man they acknowledge, the more severe they 
do not acknowledge; and yet of these, Scripture everywhere admonishes us, and the 
prophets constantly complain ( as the 13th Psalm, and some other psalms say, Ps. 
14:1-3,5:9,140:3,36:1 ), namely, of carnal security, of the contempt of God, of hatred 
toward God, and of similar faults born with us. [For Scripture clearly says that all 
these things are not blown at us, but born with us.] 12] But after the scholastics 
mingled with Christian doctrine philosophy concerning the perfection of nature 
[light of reason], and ascribed to the free will and the acts springing therefrom 
more than was sufficient, and taught that men are justified before God by philo-
sophic or civil righteousness (which we also confess to be subject to reason, and, in 
a measure, within our power), they could not see the inner 13] uncleanness of the 
nature of men. For this cannot be judged except from the Word of God, of which 
the scholastics, in their discussions, do not frequently treat.
14] These were the reasons why, in the description of original sin, we made men-
tion of concupiscence also, and denied to man’s natural strength the fear of God 
and trust in Him. For we wished to indicate that original sin contains also these 
diseases, namely, ignorance of God, contempt for God, the being destitute of the 
fear of God and trust in Him, inability to love God. These are the chief faults of 
human nature, conflicting especially with the first table of the Decalog.
15] Neither have we said anything new. The ancient definition understood aright 
expresses precisely the same thing when it says: “Original sin is the absence of 
original righteousness” [a lack of the first purity and righteousness in Paradise]. 
But what is righteousness? Here the scholastics wrangle about dialectic questions; 
they do not explain what original righteousness is. 16] Now in the Scriptures, 
righteousness comprises not only the second table of the Decalog [regarding good 
works in serving our fellow-man], but the first also, which teaches concerning 17] 
the fear of God, concerning faith, concerning the love of God. Therefore original 
righteousness was to embrace not only an even temperament of the bodily qualities 
[perfect health and, in all respects, pure blood, unimpaired powers of the body, as 
they contend], but also these gifts, namely, a quite certain knowledge of God, fear 
of God, confidence in God, or certainly 18] the rectitude and power to yield these 
affections [but the greatest feature in that noble first creature was a bright light in 
the heart to know God and His work, etc.]. And Scripture testifies to this, when 
it says, Gen. 1:27, that man was fashioned in the image and likeness of God. What 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
55
else is this than that there were embodied in man such wisdom and righteousness 
as apprehended God, and in which God was reflected, i.e., to man there were given 
the gifts of the knowledge of God, the fear of God, confidence in God, and the 
like? 19] For thus Irenaeus and Ambrose interpret the likeness to God, the latter 
of whom not only says many things to this effect, but especially declares: That soul 
is not, therefore, in the image of God, in which God is not at all times. 20] And 
Paul shows in the Epistles to the Ephesians 5:9, and Colossians 3:10, that the image 
of God is the knowledge of God, righteousness, and truth. 21] Nor does Longo-
bard fear to say that original righteousness is the very likeness to God which God 
implanted in man. 22] We recount the opinions of the ancients, which in no way 
interfere with Augustine’s interpretation of the image.
23] Therefore the ancient definition, when it says that sin is the lack of righteous-
ness, not only denies obedience with respect to man’s lower powers [that man is 
not only corrupt in his body and its meanest and lowest faculties], but also denies 
the knowledge of God, confidence in God, the fear and love of God or certainly the 
power to produce these affections [the light in the heart which creates a love and 
desire for these matters]. For even the theologians themselves teach in their schools 
that these are not produced without certain gifts and the aid of grace. In order that 
the matter may be understood, we term these very gifts the knowledge of God, and 
fear and confidence in God. From these facts it appears that the ancient definition 
says precisely the same thing that we say, denying fear and confidence toward God, 
to wit, not only the acts, but also the gifts and power to produce these acts [that 
we have no good heart toward God, which truly loves God, not only that we are 
unable to do or achieve any perfectly good work].
24] Of the same import is the definition which occurs in the writings of Augus-
tine, who is accustomed to define original sin as concupiscence [wicked desire]. 
For he means that when righteousness had been lost, concupiscence came in its 
place. For inasmuch as diseased nature cannot fear and love God and believe God, 
it seeks and loves carnal things. God’s judgment it either contemns, when at ease, 
or hates, when thoroughly terrified. Thus Augustine includes both the defect and 
25] the vicious habit which has come in its place. Nor indeed is concupiscence only 
a corruption of the qualities of the body, but also, in the higher powers, a vicious 
turning to carnal things. Nor do those persons see what they say who ascribe to 
man at the same time concupiscence that is not entirely destroyed by the Holy 
Ghost, and love to God above all things.
26] We, therefore, have been right in expressing, in our description of original sin, 
both namely, these defects: the not being able to believe God, the not being able 
to fear and love God; and, likewise: the having concupiscence, which seeks carnal 
The Lutheran Confessions
56
things contrary to God’s Word, i.e., seeks not only the pleasure of the body, but 
also carnal wisdom and righteousness, and, contemning God, trusts in these as 
good things. 27] Nor only the ancients [like Augustine and others], but also the 
more recent [teachers and scholastics], at least the wiser ones among them, teach 
that original sin is at the same time truly these, namely, the defects which I have 
recounted, and concupiscence. For Thomas says thus: Original sin comprehends the 
loss of original righteousness, and with this an inordinate disposition of the parts 
of the soul; whence it is not pure loss, but a corrupt habit [something positive]. 28] 
And Bonaventura: When the question is asked, What is original sin? the correct 
answer is, that it is immoderate [unchecked] concupiscence. The correct answer is 
also, that it is want of the righteousness that is due. And in one of these replies the 
other is included. 29] The same is the opinion of Hugo, when he says that original 
sin is ignorance in the mind and concupiscence in the flesh. For he thereby indi-
cates that when we are born, we bring with us ignorance of God, unbelief, distrust, 
contempt, and hatred of God. 30] For when he mentions ignorance, he includes 
these. And these opinions [even of the most recent teachers] also agree with Scrip-
ture. For Paul sometimes expressly calls it a defect [a lack of divine light], as 1 Cor. 
2:14: The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God. 31] In another 
place, Rom. 7:5, he calls it concupiscence, working in our members to bring forth 
fruit unto death. We could cite more passages relating to both parts; but in regard 
to a manifest fact there is no need of testimonies. And the intelligent reader will 
readily be able to decide that to be without the fear of God and without faith are 
more than actual guilt. For they are abiding defects in our unrenewed nature.
32] In reference to original sin we therefore hold nothing differing either from 
Scripture or from the Church catholic, but cleanse from corruptions and restore 
to light most important declarations of Scripture and of the Fathers, that had 
been covered over by the sophistical controversies of modern theologians. For it is 
manifest from the subject itself that modern theologians have not noticed what the 
Fathers meant when they spake of defect [lack of original righteousness]. 33] But 
the knowledge of original sin is necessary. For the magnitude of the grace of Christ 
cannot be understood [no one can heartily long and have a desire for Christ, for 
the inexpressibly great treasure of divine favor and grace which the Gospel offers], 
unless our diseases be recognized. [As Christ says Matt. 9:12; Mark 2:17: They that 
are whole need not a physician.] The entire righteousness of man is mere hypocrisy 
[and abomination] before God, unless we acknowledge that our heart is naturally 
34] destitute of love, fear, and confidence in God [that we are miserable sinners 
who are in disgrace with God]. For this reason the prophet Jeremiah 31:19, says: 
After that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh. Likewise Ps. 116:11: I said in my 
haste, All men are liars, i.e., not thinking aright concerning God.

35] Here our adversaries inveigh against Luther also because he wrote that “Orig-
inal sin remains after Baptism.” They add that this article was justly condemned 
by Leo X. But His Imperial Majesty will find on this point a manifest slander. For 
our adversaries know in what sense Luther intended this remark that original sin 
remains after Baptism. He always wrote thus, namely, that Baptism removes the 
guilt of original sin, although the material, as they call it, of the sin, i.e., concupis-
cence, remains. He also added in reference to the material that the Holy Ghost, 
given through Baptism, begins to mortify the concupiscence, and creates new 
movements [a new light, a new sense and spirit] in man. 36] In the same-manner, 
Augustine also speaks, who says: Sin is remitted in Baptism, not in such a manner 
that it no longer exists, but so that it is not imputed. Here he confesses openly that 
sin exists, i.e., that it remains, although it is not imputed. And this judgment was 
so agreeable to those who succeeded him that it was recited also in the decrees. 
Also against Julian, Augustine says: The Law, which is in the members, has been 
annulled by spiritual regeneration, and remains in the mortal flesh. It has been 
annulled because the guilt has been remitted in the Sacrament, by which believers 
are born again; but it remains, because it produces desires, against which believ-
ers contend. 37] Our adversaries know that Luther believes and teaches thus, and 
while they cannot reject the matter they nevertheless pervert his words, in order by 
this artifice to crush an innocent man.
38] But they contend that concupiscence is a penalty, and not a sin [a burden and 
imposed penalty, and is not such a sin as is subject to death and condemnation]. 
Luther maintains that it is a sin. It has been said above that Augustine defines 
original sin as concupiscence. If there be anything disadvantageous in this opin-
ion, 39] let them quarrel with Augustine. Besides Paul says, Rom. 7:7. 23: I had 
not known lust (concupiscence), except the Law had said, Thou shalt not covet. 
Likewise: I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, 
and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. These 
testimonies can be overthrown by no sophistry. [All devils, all men cannot over-
throw them.] 40] For they clearly call concupiscence sin, which, nevertheless, is not 
imputed to those who are in Christ, although by nature it is a matter worthy of 
death where it is not forgiven. 41] Thus, beyond all controversy, the Fathers believe. 
For Augustine, in a long discussion, refutes the opinion of those who thought that 
concupiscence in man is not a fault, but an adiaphoron, as color of the body or ill 
health is said to be an adiaphoron [as to have a black or a white body is neither 
good nor evil].
42] But if the adversaries will contend that the fomes [or evil inclination] is an 
adiaphoron, not only many passages of Scripture, but simply the entire Church 
[and all the Fathers] will contradict them. For [even if not entire consent, but only 
The Lutheran Confessions
58
the inclination and desire be there] who ever dared to say that these matters, even 
though perfect agreement could not be attained, were adiaphora, namely, to doubt 
concerning God’s wrath, concerning God’s grace, concerning God’s Word, to be 
angry at the judgments of God, to be provoked because God does not at once deliv-
er one from afflictions, to murmur because the wicked enjoy a better fortune than 
the good, to be urged on by wrath, 43] lust, the desire for glory, wealth, etc.? And 
yet godly men acknowledge these in themselves, as appears in the Psalms and the 
prophets. [For all tried, Christian hearts know, alas! that these evils are wrapped up 
in man’s skin, namely to esteem money, goods, and all other matters more highly 
than God, and to spend our lives in security; again, that after the manner of our 
carnal security we always imagine that God’s wrath against sin is not as serious 
and great as it verily is. Again, that we murmur against the doing and will of God, 
when He does not succor us speedily in our tribulations, and arranges our affairs 
to please us. Again, we experience every day that it hurts us to see wicked people in 
good fortune in this world, as David and all the saints have complained. Over and 
above this, all men feel that their hearts are easily inflamed, now with ambition, 
now with anger and wrath, now with lewdness.] But in the schools they transferred 
hither from philosophy notions entirely different, that, because of passions, we are 
neither good nor evil, we are neither deserving of praise nor blame. Likewise, that 
nothing is sin, unless it be voluntary [inner desires and thoughts are not sins, if I do 
not altogether consent thereto]. These notions were expressed among philosophers 
with respect to civil righteousness, and not with respect to God’s judgment. [For 
there it is true, as the jurists say, L. cogitationis, thoughts are exempt from custom 
and punishment. But God searches the hearts; in God’s court and judgment it is 
different.] With no greater prudence they add also other notions, such as, that 
[God’s creature and] nature is not [cannot in itself be] evil. In its proper place we 
do not censure this; but it is not right to twist it into an extenuation of original 
sin. And, nevertheless, these notions are read in the works of scholastics, who 
inappropriately mingle philosophy or civil doctrine concerning ethics with the 
Gospel. 44] Nor were these matters only disputed in the schools, but, as is usually 
the case, were carried from the schools to the people. And these persuasions [god-
less, erroneous, dangerous, harmful teachings] prevailed, and nourished confidence 
in human strength, and suppressed the knowledge of Christ’s grace. 45] Therefore, 
Luther wishing to declare the magnitude of original sin and of human infirmity 
[what a grievous mortal guilt original sin is in the sight of God], taught that these 
remnants of original sin [after Baptism] are not, by their own nature, adiaphora in 
man, but that, for their non-imputation, they need the grace of Christ and, like-
wise for their mortification, the Holy Ghost.
46] Although the scholastics extenuate both sin and punishment when they teach 
that man, by his own strength, can fulfil the commandments of God; in Genesis 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
59
the punishment, imposed on account of original sin, is described otherwise. For 
there human nature is subjected not only to death and other bodily evils, but also 
to the kingdom of the devil. For there, Gen. 3:15, this fearful sentence is pro-
claimed: I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and 
her seed. 47] The defects and the concupiscence are punishments and sins. Death 
and other bodily evils, and the dominion of the devil, are properly punishments. 
For human nature has been delivered into slavery and is held captive by the devil, 
who infatuates it with wicked opinions and errors, and 48] impels it to sins of 
every kind. But just as the devil cannot be conquered except by the aid of Christ, 
so by our own strength we cannot free ourselves 49] from this slavery. Even the his-
tory of the world shows how great is the power of the devil’s kingdom. The world 
is full of blasphemies against God and of wicked opinions, and the devil keeps 
entangled in these bands those who are wise and 50] righteous [many hypocrites 
who appear holy] in the sight of the world. In other persons grosser vices manifest 
themselves. But since Christ was given to us to remove both these sins and these 
punishments, and to destroy the kingdom of the devil, sin and death, it will not be 
possible to recognize the benefits of Christ unless we understand our evils. For this 
reason our preachers have diligently taught concerning these subjects, and have 
delivered nothing that is new, but have set forth Holy Scripture and the judgments 
of the holy Fathers.
51] We think that this will satisfy His Imperial Majesty concerning the puerile 
and trivial sophistry with which the adversaries have perverted our article. For we 
know that we believe aright and in harmony with the Church catholic of Christ. 
But if the adversaries will renew this controversy, there will be no want among 
us of those who will reply and defend the truth. For in this case our adversaries, 
to a great extent, do not understand what they say. They often speak what is 
contradictory, and neither explain correctly and logically that which is essential to 
[i.e., that which is or is not properly of the essence of] original sin, nor what they 
call defects. But we have been unwilling at this place to examine their contests 
with any very great subtlety. We have thought it worth while only to recite, in 
customary and well-known words, the belief of the holy Fathers, which we also 
follow.
Article III: Of Christ
52] The Third Article the adversaries approve, in which we confess that there are in 
Christ two natures, namely, a human nature, assumed by the Word into the unity 
of His person, and that the same Christ suffered and died to reconcile the Father 
to us; and that He was raised again to reign, and to justify and sanctify believers, 
etc., according to the Apostles’ Creed and the Nicene Creed.
The Lutheran Confessions
60
Article IV (II): Of Justification.
1] In the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and, below, in the Twentieth Article, they condemn 
us, for teaching that men obtain remission of sins not because of their own merits, 
but freely for Christ’s sake, through faith in Christ. [They reject quite stubbornly 
both these statements.] For they condemn us both for denying that men obtain 
remission of sins because of their own merits, and for affirming that, through 
faith, men obtain remission of sins, and through faith in Christ 2] are justified. But 
since in this controversy the chief topic of Christian doctrine is treated, which, 
understood aright, illumines and amplifies the honor of Christ [which is of especial 
service for the clear, correct understanding of the entire Holy Scriptures, and alone 
shows the way to the unspeakable treasure and right knowledge of Christ, and 
alone opens the door to the entire Bible], and brings necessary and most abundant 
consolation to devout consciences, we ask His Imperial Majesty to hear us with 
forbearance in regard to matters of such importance. 3] For since the adversaries 
understand neither what the remission of sins, nor what faith, nor what grace, nor 
what righteousness is, they sadly corrupt this topic, and obscure the glory and ben-
efits of Christ, and rob devout consciences of the consolations offered in Christ. 4] 
But that we may strengthen the position of our Confession, and also remove the 
charges which the adversaries advance against us, certain things are to be premised 
in the beginning, in order that the sources of both kinds of doctrine, i.e., both that 
of our adversaries and our own, may be known.
5] All Scripture ought to be distributed into these two principal topics, the Law 
and the promises. For in some places it presents the Law, and in others the promise 
concerning Christ, namely, either when [in the Old Testament] it promises that 
Christ will come, and offers, for His sake, the remission of sins justification, and 
life eternal, or when, in the Gospel [in the New Testament], Christ Himself, since 
He has appeared, promises the remission of sins, justification, and life eternal. 6] 
Moreover, in this discussion, by Law we designate the Ten Commandments, wher-
ever they are read in the Scriptures. Of the ceremonies and judicial laws of Moses 
we say nothing at present.
7] Of these two parts the adversaries select the Law, because human reason 
naturally understands, in some way, the Law (for it has the same judgment divinely 
written in the mind); [the natural law agrees with the law of Moses, or the Ten 
Commandments] and by the Law they seek the remission of sins and justification. 
8] Now, the Decalog requires not only outward civil works, which reason can 
in some way produce, but it also requires other things placed far above reason, 
namely, truly to fear God, truly to love God, truly to call upon God, truly to be 
convinced that God hears us, and to expect the aid of God in death and in all 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
61
afflictions; finally, it requires obedience to God, in death and all afflictions, so that 
we may not flee from these or refuse them when God imposes them.
9] Here the scholastics, having followed the philosophers, teach only a righteous-
ness of reason, namely, civil works, and fabricate besides that without the Holy 
Ghost reason can love God above all things. For, as long as the human mind is at 
ease, and does not feel the wrath or judgment of God, it can imagine that it wishes 
to love God, that it wishes to do good for God’s sake. [But it is sheer hypocrisy.] In 
this manner they teach that men merit the remission of sins by doing what is in 
them, i.e., if reason, grieving over sin, elicit an act of love to God, or 10] for God’s 
sake be active in that which is good. And because this opinion naturally flatters 
men, it has brought forth and multiplied in the Church many services, monastic 
vows, abuses of the mass; and, with this opinion the one has, in the course of time, 
devised this act of worship and observances, the other that. 11] And in order that 
they might nourish and increase confidence in such works, they have affirmed that 
God necessarily gives grace to one thus working, by the necessity not of constraint 
but of immutability [not that He is constrained, but that this is the order which 
God will not transgress or alter].
12] In this opinion there are many great and pernicious errors, which it would be 
tedious to enumerate. Let the discreet reader think only of this: If this be Christian 
righteousness, what difference is there between philosophy and the doctrine of 
Christ? If we merit the remission of sins by these elicit acts [that spring from our 
mind], of what benefit is Christ? If we can be justified by reason and the works 
of reason, wherefore is there need 13] of Christ or regeneration [as Peter declares, 
1 Pet. 1:18ff ]? And from these opinions the matter has now come to such a pass 
that many ridicule us because we teach that an other than 14] the philosophic 
righteousness must be sought after. [Alas! it has come to this, that even great 
theologians at Louvain, Paris, etc., have known nothing of any other godliness or 
righteousness (although every letter and syllable in Paul teaches otherwise) than 
the godliness which philosophers teach. And although we ought to regard this 
as a strange teaching, and ought to ridicule it, they rather ridicule us, yea, make 
a jest of Paul himself.] We have heard that some after setting aside the Gospel, 
have, instead of a sermon, explained the ethics of Aristotle. [I myself have heard 
a great preacher who did not mention Christ and the Gospel, and preached the 
ethics of Aristotle. Is this not a childish, foolish way to preach to Christians?] 
Nor did such men err if those things are true which the adversaries defend [if the 
doctrine of the adversaries be true, the Ethics is a precious book of sermons, and 
a fine new Bible]. For Aristotle wrote concerning civil morals so learnedly that 
nothing further concerning this need be demanded. 15] We see books extant in 
which certain sayings of Christ are compared with the sayings of Socrates, Zeno, 
The Lutheran Confessions
62
and others, as though Christ had come for the purpose of delivering certain laws 
through which we might merit the remission of sins, as though we did not receive 
this 16] gratuitously because of His merits. Therefore, if we here receive the 
doctrine of the adversaries, that by the works of reason we merit the remission of 
sins and justification, there will be no difference between philosophic, or certainly 
pharisaic, and Christian righteousness.
17] Although the adversaries, not to pass by Christ altogether, require a knowledge 
of the history concerning Christ, and ascribe to Him that it is His merit that a 
habit is given us or, as they say, prima gratia, “first grace,” which they understand 
as a habit, inclining us the more readily to love God; yet, what they ascribe to this 
habit is of little importance [is a feeble, paltry, small, poor operation, that would 
be ascribed to Christ], because they imagine that the acts of the will are of the 
same kind before and after this habit. They imagine that the will can love God; 
but nevertheless this habit stimulates it to do the same the more cheerfully. And 
they bid us first merit this habit by preceding merits; then they bid us merit by 
the works of the Law an increase of this habit and 18] life eternal. Thus they bury 
Christ, so that men may not avail themselves of Him as a Mediator, and believe 
that for His sake they freely receive remission of sins and reconciliation, but may 
dream that by their own fulfilment of the Law they merit the remission of sins, and 
that by their own fulfilment of the Law they are accounted righteous before God; 
while, nevertheless, the Law is never satisfied, since reason does nothing except cer-
tain civil works, and, in the mean time, neither [in the heart] fears God, nor truly 
believes that God cares for it. And although they speak of this habit, yet, without 
the righteousness of faith, neither the love of God can exist in man, nor can it be 
understood what the love of God is.
19] Their feigning a distinction between meritum congrui and meritum condigni 
[due merit and true, complete merit] is only an artifice in order not to appear 
openly to Pelagianize. For, if God necessarily gives grace for the meritum congrui 
[due merit], it is no longer meritum congrui, but meritum condigni [a true duty 
and complete merit]. But they do not know what they are saying. After this habit 
of love [is there], they imagine that man can acquire merit de condigno. And yet 
they bid us doubt whether there be a habit present. How, therefore, do they know 
whether they acquire merit de congruo or 20] de condigno [in full, or half]? But this 
whole matter was fabricated by idle men [But, good God! these are mere inane 
ideas and dreams of idle, wretched, inexperienced men, who do not much reduce 
the Bible to practise], who did not know how the remission of sins occurs, and 
how, in the judgment of God and terrors of conscience, trust in works is driven out 
of us. Secure hypocrites always judge that they acquire merit de condigno, whether 
the habit be present or be not present, because men naturally trust in their own 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
63
righteousness; but terrified consciences waver and hesitate, and then seek and ac-
cumulate other works in order to find rest. Such consciences never think that they 
acquire merit de condigno, and they rush into despair unless they hear, in addition 
to the doctrine of the Law, the Gospel concerning the gratuitous remission of sins 
and the righteousness of faith. [Thus some stories are told that when the Barefoot-
ed monks had in vain praised their order and good works to some good conscienc-
es in the hour of death, they at last had to be silent concerning their order and 
St. Franciscus, and to say: “Dear man, Christ has died for you.” This revived and 
refreshed in trouble, and alone gave peace and comfort.]
21] Thus the adversaries teach nothing but the righteousness of reason, or 
certainly of the Law, upon which they look just as the Jews upon the veiled 
face of Moses; and, in secure hypocrites who think that they satisfy the Law, 
they excite presumption and empty confidence in works [they place men on a 
sand foundation, their own works] and contempt of the grace of Christ. On the 
contrary, they drive timid consciences to despair, which laboring with doubt, never 
can experience what faith is, and how efficacious it is; thus, at last they utterly 
despair.
22] Now, we think concerning the righteousness of reason thus, namely, that God 
requires it, and that, because of God’s commandment, the honorable works which 
the Decalog commands must necessarily be performed, according to the passage 
Gal. 3:24: The Law was our schoolmaster; likewise 1 Tim. 1:9: The Law is made for 
the ungodly. For God wishes those who are carnal [gross sinners] to be restrained 
by civil discipline, and to maintain this, He has given laws, letters, doctrine, mag-
istrates, penalties. 23] And this righteousness reason, by its own strength, can, to 
a certain extent, work, although it is often overcome by natural weakness, and by 
the devil impelling it to 24] manifest crimes. Now, although we cheerfully assign 
this righteousness of reason the praises that are due it (for this corrupt nature has 
no greater good [in this life and in a worldly nature, nothing is ever better than 
uprightness and virtue], and Aristotle says aright: Neither the evening star nor the 
morning star is more beautiful than righteousness, and God also honors it with 
bodily rewards), yet it ought not to be praised with reproach to Christ.
25] For it is false [I thus conclude, and am certain that it is a fiction, and not true] 
that we merit the remission of sins by our works.
26] False also is this, that men are accounted righteous before God because of the 
righteousness of reason [works and external piety].
The Lutheran Confessions
64
27] False also is this that reason, by its own strength, is able to love God above all 
things, and to fulfil God’s Law, namely, truly to fear God, to be truly confident 
that God hears prayer, to be willing to obey God in death and other dispensations 
of God, not to covet what belongs to others, etc.; although reason can work civil 
works.
28] False also and dishonoring Christ is this, that men do not sin who, without 
grace, do the commandments of God [who keep the commandments of God merely 
in an external manner, without the Spirit and grace in their hearts].
29] We have testimonies for this our belief, not only from the Scriptures, but also 
from the Fathers. For in opposition to the Pelagians, Augustine contends at great 
length that grace is not given because of our merits. And in De Natura et Gratia 
he says: If natural ability, through the free will, suffice both for learning to know 
how one ought to live and for living aright, then Christ has died in vain, then 
the offense of the Cross is made void. 30] Why may I not also here cry out? Yea, I 
will cry out, and, with Christian grief, will chide them: Christ has become of no 
effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the Law; ye are fallen from grace. 
Gal. 5:4; cf. 2:21. For they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about 
to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the 
righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every 
one that believeth. Rom. 10:3,4,31] And John 8:36: If the Son therefore shall make 
you free, ye shall be free indeed. Therefore by reason we cannot be freed from sins 
and merit the remission of sins. And in John 3:5 it is written: Except a man be born 
of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. But if it is 
necessary to be born again of the Holy Ghost, the righteousness of reason does not 
justify us before God, and does not 32] fulfil the Law, Rom. 3:23: All have come 
short of the glory of God, i.e., are destitute of the wisdom and righteousness of 
God, which acknowledges and glorifies God. Likewise Rom. 8:7-8: The carnal mind 
is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can 
be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. 33] These testimonies are 
so manifest that, to use the words of Augustine which he employed in this case, 
they do not need an acute understanding, but only an attentive hearer. If the carnal 
mind is enmity against God, the flesh certainly does not love God; if it cannot be 
subject to the Law of God, it cannot love God. If the carnal mind is enmity against 
God, the flesh sins, even when we do external civil works. If it cannot be subject 
to the Law of God, it certainly sins even when, 34] according to human judgment, 
it possesses deeds that are excellent and worthy of praise. The adversaries consider 
only the precepts of the Second Table which contain civil righteousness that reason 
understands. Content with this, they think that they satisfy the Law of God. In 
the mean time they do not see the First Table which commands that we love God, 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
65
that we declare as certain that God is angry with sin, that we truly fear God, that 
we declare as certain that God hears prayer. But the human heart without the Holy 
Ghost either in security despises God’s judgment, or in punishment flees from, 
and 35] hates, God when He judges. Therefore it does not obey the First Table. 
Since, therefore, contempt of God, and doubt concerning the Word of God, and 
concerning the threats and promises, inhere in human nature, men truly sin, even 
when, without the Holy Ghost, they do virtuous works, because they do them with 
a wicked heart, according to Rom. 14:23: Whatsoever is not of faith is sin. For such 
persons perform their works with contempt of God, just as Epicurus does not be-
lieve that God cares for him, or that he is regarded or heard by God. This contempt 
vitiates works seemingly virtuous, because God judges the heart.
36] Lastly, it was very foolish for the adversaries to write that men who are under 
eternal wrath merit the remission of sins by an act of love, which springs from 
their mind since it is impossible to love God, unless the remission of sins be 
apprehended first by faith. For the heart, truly feeling that God is angry, cannot 
love God, unless He be shown to have been reconciled. As long as He terrifies us, 
and seems to cast us into eternal death, human nature is not able to take cour-
age, so as to love 37] a wrathful, judging, and punishing God [poor, weak nature 
must lose heart and courage, and must tremble before such great wrath, which 
so fearfully terrifies and punishes, and can never feel a spark of love before God 
Himself comforts]. It is easy for idle men to feign such dreams concerning love, as, 
that a person guilty of mortal sin can love God above all things, because they do 
not feel what the wrath or judgment of God is. But in agony of conscience and in 
conflicts [with Satan] conscience experiences the emptiness of these philosophical 
speculations. 38] Paul says, Rom. 4:15: The Law worketh wrath. He does not say 
that by the Law men merit the remission of sins. For the Law always accuses and 
terrifies consciences. Therefore it does not justify, because conscience terrified by 
the Law flees from the judgment of God. Therefore they err who trust that by the 
Law, by their own works, they merit the remission of sins. 39] It is sufficient for 
us to have said these things concerning the righteousness of reason or of the Law, 
which the adversaries teach. For after a while, when we will declare our belief 
concerning the righteousness of faith, the subject itself will compel us to adduce 
more testimonies, which also will be of service in overthrowing the errors of the 
adversaries which we have thus far reviewed.
40] Because, therefore, men by their own strength cannot fulfil the Law of God, 
and all are under sin, and subject to eternal wrath and death, on this account 
we cannot be freed by the Law from sin and be justified, but the promise of the 
remission of sins and of justification has been given us for Christ’s sake, who was 
given for us in order that He might make satisfaction for the sins of the world, and 
The Lutheran Confessions
66
has been appointed as the [only] 41] Mediator and Propitiator. And this promise 
has not the condition of our merits [it does not read thus: Through Christ you have 
grace, salvation etc., if you merit it], but freely offers the remission of sins and jus-
tification as Paul says Rom. 11:6: If it be of works, then is it no more grace. And in 
another place, Rom. 3:21: The righteousness of God without the Law is manifested, 
i.e., the remission of sins is freely offered. Nor does reconciliation depend 42] upon 
our merits. Because if the remission of sins were to depend upon our merits, and 
reconciliation were from the Law, it would be useless. For as we do not fulfil the 
Law, it would also follow that we would never obtain the promise of reconciliation. 
Thus Paul reasons, Rom. 4:14: For if they which are of the Law be heirs, faith is 
made void, and the promise made of none effect. For if the promise would require 
the condition of our merits and the Law, which we never fulfil, it would follow 
that the promise would be useless.
43] But since justification is obtained through the free promise it follows that we 
cannot justify ourselves. Otherwise wherefore would there be need to promise? 
[And why should Paul so highly extol and praise grace?] For since the promise can-
not be received except by faith, the Gospel which is properly the promise of the re-
mission of sins and of justification for Christ’s sake, proclaims the righteousness of 
faith in Christ, which the Law does not teach. Nor is this the righteousness of the 
Law. 44] For the Law requires of us our works and our perfection. But the Gospel 
freely offers, for Christ’s sake, to us, who have been vanquished by sin and death, 
reconciliation which is received not by works, but by faith alone. This faith brings 
to God not confidence in one’s own merits, but only confidence in the promise, or 
45] the mercy promised in Christ. This special faith, therefore, by which an indi-
vidual believes that for Christ’s sake his sins are remitted him, and that for Christ’s 
sake God is reconciled and propitious, obtains remission of sins and justifies us. 
And because in repentance, i.e. in terrors, it comforts and encourages hearts, it 
regenerates us and brings the Holy Ghost that then we may be able to fulfil God’s 
Law, namely, to love God, truly to fear God, truly to be confident that God hears 
prayer, and to obey God in all afflictions; it mortifies concupiscence etc. 46] Thus, 
because faith, which freely receives the remission of sins, sets Christ, the Mediator 
and Propitiator, against God’s wrath, it does not present our merits or our love 
[which would be tossed aside like a little feather by a hurricane]. This faith is the 
true knowledge of Christ, and avails itself of the benefits of Christ, and regenerates 
hearts, and precedes the fulfilling of the Law. And 47] of this faith not a syllable 
exists in the doctrine of our adversaries. Hence we find fault with the adversaries, 
equally because they teach only the righteousness of the Law, and because they do 
not teach the righteousness of the Gospel, which proclaims the righteousness of 
faith in Christ.

What Is Justifying Faith?
48] The adversaries feign that faith is only a knowledge of the history, and there-
fore teach that it can coexist with mortal sin. Hence they say nothing concerning 
faith, by which Paul so frequently says that men are justified, because those who 
are accounted righteous before God do not live in mortal sin. But that faith which 
justifies is not merely a knowledge of history, [not merely this, that I know the sto-
ries of Christ’s birth, suffering, etc. (that even the devils know,)] but it is to assent 
to the promise of God, in which, for Christ’s sake, the remission of sins and justifi-
cation are freely offered. [It is the certainty or the certain trust in the heart, when, 
with my whole heart, I regard the promises of God as certain and true, through 
which there are offered me, without my merit, the forgiveness of sins, grace, and 
all salvation, through Christ the Mediator.] And that no one may suppose that 
it is mere knowledge, we will add further: it is to wish and to receive the offered 
promise of the remission of sins and of justification. [Faith is that my whole heart 
takes to itself this treasure. It is not my doing, not my presenting or giving, not my 
work or preparation, but that a heart comforts itself, and is perfectly confident 
with respect to this, namely, that God makes a present and gift to us, and not we to 
Him, that He sheds upon us every treasure of grace in Christ.]
49] And the difference between this faith and the righteousness of the Law can be 
easily discerned. Faith is the latreiva [divine service], which receives the benefits 
offered by God; the righteousness of the Law is the latreiva [divine service] which 
offers to God our merits. By faith God wishes to be worshiped in this way, that we 
receive from Him those things which He promises and offers.
50] Now, that faith signifies, not only a knowledge of the history, but such faith 
as assents to the promise, Paul plainly testifies when he says, Rom. 4:16: Therefore 
it is of faith, to the end the promise might be sure. For he judges that the promise 
cannot be received unless by faith. Wherefore he puts them together as things 
that belong to one another, and connects promise and faith. [There Paul fastens 
and binds together these two, thus: Wherever there is a promise faith is required, 
and conversely, wherever faith is required, there must be a promise.] 51] Although 
it will be easy to decide what faith is if we consider the Creed, where this article 
certainly stands: The forgiveness of sins. Therefore it is not enough to believe that 
Christ was born, suffered, was raised again, unless we add also this article, which 
is the purpose of the history: The forgiveness of sins. To this article the rest must 
be referred, namely, that for Christ’s sake, and not for the sake of our merits, 52] 
forgiveness of sins is given us. For what need was there that Christ was given for 
our sins if for our sins our merits can make satisfaction?

53] As often, therefore, as we speak of justifying faith, we must keep in mind 
that these three objects concur: the promise, and that, too, gratuitous, and the 
merits of Christ, as the price and propitiation. The promise is received by faith; 
the “gratuitous” excludes our merits, and signifies that the benefit is offered only 
through mercy; the merits of Christ are the price, because there must be a certain 
propitiation for our sins. 54] Scripture frequently implores mercy; and the holy 
Fathers often say that we 55] are saved by mercy. As often, therefore, as mention is 
made of mercy, we must keep in mind that faith is there required, which receives 
the promise of mercy. And, again, as often as we speak of faith, we wish an object 
to be understood, namely, the promised mercy. 56] For faith justifies and saves, 
not on the ground that it is a work in itself worthy, but only because it receives the 
promised mercy.
57] And throughout the prophets and the psalms this worship, this latreiva, is high-
ly praised, although the Law does not teach the gratuitous remission of sins. But 
the Fathers knew the promise concerning Christ, that God for Christ’s sake wished 
to remit sins. Therefore, since they understood that Christ would be the price for 
our sins, they knew that our works are not a price for so great a matter [could not 
pay so great a debt]. Accordingly, they received gratuitous mercy and remission 
of sins by faith, just as the saints in the New Testament. 58] Here belong those 
frequent repetitions concerning mercy and faith, in the psalms and the prophets, as 
this, Ps. 130:3 sq.: If Thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 
Here David confesses his sins, and does not recount his merits. He adds: But there 
is forgiveness with Thee. Here he comforts himself by his trust in God’s mercy, and 
he cites the promise: My soul doth wait, and in His Word do I hope, i.e., because 
Thou hast promised the remission of sins, 59] I am sustained by this Thy prom-
ise. Therefore the fathers also were justified, not by the Law, but by the promise 
and faith. And it is amazing that the adversaries extenuate faith to such a degree, 
although they see that it is everywhere praised as an eminent service, as in Ps. 
50:15: Call upon Me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee. 60] Thus God wishes 
Himself to be known, thus He wishes Himself to be worshiped, that from Him we 
receive benefits, and receive them, too, because of His mercy, and not because of 
our merits. This is the richest consolation in all afflictions [physical or spiritual, in 
life or in death, as all godly persons know]. And such consolations the adversaries 
abolish when they extenuate and disparage faith, and teach only that by means of 
works and merits men treat with God [that we treat with God, the great Majesty, 
by means of our miserable, beggarly works and merits].
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession

That Faith in Christ Justifies.
61] In the first place, lest any one may think that we speak concerning an idle 
knowledge of the history, we must declare how faith is obtained [how the heart 
begins to believe]. Afterward we will show both that it justifies, and how this 
ought to be understood, and we will explain the objections of the adversaries. 62] 
Christ, in the last chapter of Luke 24:47, commands that repentance and remission 
of sins should be preached in His name. For the Gospel convicts all men that they 
are under sin, that they all are subject to eternal wrath and death, and offers, for 
Christ’s sake, remission of sin and justification, which is received by faith. The 
preaching of repentance, which accuses us, terrifies consciences with true and 
grave terrors. [For the preaching of repentance, or this declaration of the Gospel: 
Amend your lives! Repent! when it truly penetrates the heart, terrifies the con-
science, and is no jest, but a great terror, in which the conscience feels its misery 
and sin, and the wrath of God.] In these, hearts ought again to receive consolation. 
This happens if they believe the promise of Christ, that for His sake we have remis-
sion of sins. This faith, encouraging and consoling in these fears, receives remission 
of sins, justifies and quickens. For this consolation is a new and spiritual 63] life [a 
new birth and a new life]. These things are plain and clear, and can be understood 
by the pious, and have testimonies of the Church [as is to be seen in the conversion 
of Paul and Augustine]. The adversaries nowhere can say how the Holy Ghost is 
given. They imagine that the Sacraments confer the Holy Ghost ex opere operato, 
without a good emotion in the recipient, as though indeed, the gift of the Holy 
Ghost were an idle matter.
64] But since we speak of such faith as is not an idle thought, but of that which 
liberates from death and produces a new life in hearts, [which is such a new light, 
life, and force in the heart as to renew our heart, mind, and spirit, makes new 
men of us and new creatures,] and is the work of the Holy Ghost; this does not 
coexist with mortal sin [for how can light and darkness coexist?], but as long as it 
is present, produces good 65] fruits, as we will say after a while. For concerning 
the conversion of the wicked, or concerning the mode of regeneration, what can 
be said that is more simple and more clear? Let them, from so great an array of 
writers, adduce a single commentary upon the Sententiae that speaks 66] of the 
mode of regeneration. When they speak of the habit of love, they imagine that 
men merit it through works, and they do not teach that it is received through the 
Word, precisely as also the Anabaptists teach at this time. 67] But God cannot be 
treated with, God cannot be apprehended, except through the Word. Accordingly, 
justification occurs through the Word, just as Paul says, Rom. 1:16: The Gospel 
is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. Likewise Rom. 
10:17: Faith cometh by hearing. And proof can be derived even from this that faith 
The Lutheran Confessions
70
justifies, because, if justification occurs only through the Word, and the Word is 
apprehended only by faith, it follows that faith justifies. 68] But there are other 
and more important reasons. We have said these things thus far in order that we 
might show the mode of regeneration, and that the nature of faith [what is, or is 
not, faith], concerning which we speak, might be understood.
69] Now we will show that faith [and nothing else] justifies. Here, in the first 
place, readers must be admonished of this, that just as it is necessary to maintain 
this sentence: Christ is Mediator, so is it necessary to defend that faith justifies, 
[without works]. For how will Christ be Mediator if in justification we do not use 
Him as Mediator; if we do not hold that for His sake we are accounted righteous? 
But to believe is to trust in the merits of Christ, that for His sake God certainly 
wishes to be reconciled with us. 70] Likewise, just as we ought to maintain that, 
apart from the Law, the promise of Christ is necessary, so also is it needful to 
maintain that faith justifies. [For the Law does not preach the forgiveness of sin by 
grace.] For the Law cannot be performed unless the Holy Ghost be first received. It 
is, therefore, needful to maintain that the promise of Christ is necessary. But this 
cannot be received except by faith. Therefore, those who deny that faith justifies, 
teach nothing but the Law, both Christ and the Gospel being set aside.
71] But when it is said that faith justifies, some perhaps understand it of the 
beginning, namely, that faith is the beginning of justification or preparation for 
justification, so that not faith itself is that through which we are accepted by 
God, but the works which follow; and they dream, accordingly, that faith is highly 
praised, because it is the beginning. For great is the importance of the beginning, 
as they commonly say, The beginning is half of everything; just as if one would 
say that grammar makes the teachers of all arts, because it prepares for other arts, 
although in fact it is his own art that renders every one an artist. We do not believe 
thus concerning faith, but we maintain this, that properly and truly, by faith itself, 
we are for Christ’s sake accounted righteous, or are acceptable to God. 72] And 
because “to be justified” means that out of unjust men just men are made, or born 
again, it means also that they are pronounced or accounted just. For Scripture 
speaks in both ways. [The term “to be justified” is used in two ways: to denote, 
being converted or regenerated; again, being accounted righteous.] Accordingly we 
wish first to show this, that faith alone makes of an unjust, a just man, i.e., receives 
remission of sins.
73] The particle alone offends some, although even Paul says, Rom. 3:28: We con-
clude that a man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the Law. Again, Eph. 
2:8: It is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast. Again, Rom. 3:24: 
Being justified freely. If the exclusive alone displeases, let them remove from Paul 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
71
also the exclusives freely, not of works, it is the gift, etc. For these also are [very 
strong] exclusives. It is, however, the opinion of merit that we exclude. We do not 
exclude the Word or Sacraments, as the adversaries falsely charge us. For we have 
said above that faith is conceived from the Word, and we honor the ministry of the 
Word in the highest degree. 74] Love also and works must follow faith. Wherefore, 
they are not excluded so as not to follow, but confidence in the merit of love or of 
works is excluded in justification. And this we will clearly show.
That We Obtain Remission of Sins by Faith Alone in Christ.
75] We think that even the adversaries acknowledge that, in justification, the 
remission of sins is necessary first. For we all are under sin. Wherefore we reason 
thus:-
76] To attain the remission of sins is to be justified, according to Ps. 32:1: Blessed 
77]is he whose transgression is forgiven. By faith alone in Christ, not through love, 
not because of love or works, do we acquire the remission of sins, although love fol-
lows faith. 78]Therefore by faith alone we are justified, understanding justification 
as the making of a righteous man out of an unrighteous, or that he be regenerated.
79] It will thus become easy to declare the minor premise [that we obtain forgive-
ness of sin by faith, not by love] if we know how the remission of sins occurs. The 
adversaries with great indifference dispute whether the remission of sins and the 
infusion of grace are the same change [whether they are one change or two]. Being 
idle men, they did not know what to answer [cannot speak at all on this subject]. 
In the remission of sins, the terrors of sin and of eternal death, in the heart, must 
be overcome, as Paul testifies, 1 Cor. 15:56 sq.: The sting of death is sin, and the 
strength of sin is the Law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory 
through our Lord Jesus Christ. That is, sin terrifies consciences, this occurs through 
the Law, which shows the wrath of God against sin; but we gain the victory 
through Christ. How? By faith, when we comfort ourselves by confidence in the 
mercy promised for 80] Christ’s sake. Thus, therefore, we prove the minor proposi-
tion. The wrath of God cannot be appeased if we set against it our own works, be-
cause Christ has been set forth as a Propitiator, so that for His sake, the Father may 
become reconciled to us. But Christ is not apprehended as a Mediator except by 
faith. Therefore, by faith alone we obtain remission of sins, when we comfort our 
hearts with confidence in the mercy promised for 81] Christ’s sake. Likewise Paul, 
Rom. 5:2, says: By whom also we have access, and adds, by faith. Thus, therefore, we 
are reconciled to the Father, and receive remission of sins when we are comforted 
with confidence in the mercy promised for Christ’s sake. The adversaries regard 
The Lutheran Confessions
72
Christ as Mediator and Propitiator for this reason, namely, that He has merited 
the habit of love; they do not urge us to use Him now as Mediator, but, as though 
Christ were altogether buried, they imagine that we have access through our own 
works, and, through these, merit this habit, and afterwards, by this love, come to 
God. Is not this to bury Christ altogether, and to take away the entire doctrine of 
faith? Paul on the contrary, teaches that we have access, i.e., reconciliation, through 
Christ. And to show how this occurs, he adds that we have access by faith. By faith, 
therefore, for Christ’s sake, we receive remission of sins. We cannot set our own 
love and our own works over against God’s wrath.
82] Secondly. It is certain that sins are forgiven for the sake of Christ, as 
Propitiator, Rom. 3:25: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation. Moreover, 
Paul adds: through faith. Therefore this Propitiator thus benefits us, when by 
faith we apprehend the mercy promised in Him, and set it against the wrath and 
judgment of God. And to the same effect it is written, Heb. 4:14,16: Seeing, then, 
that we have a great High Priest, etc., let us therefore come with confidence. For 
the Apostle bids us come to God, not with confidence in our own merits, but with 
confidence in Christ as a High Priest; therefore he requires faith.
83] Thirdly. Peter, in Acts 10:43, says: To Him give all the prophets witness that 
through His name, whosoever believeth on Him, shall receive remission of sins. 
How could this be said more clearly? We receive remission of sins, he says, through 
His name, i.e., for His sake; therefore, not for the sake of our merits, not for the 
sake of our contrition, attrition, love, worship, works. And he adds: When we 
believe in Him. Therefore he requires faith. For we cannot apprehend the name of 
Christ except by faith. Besides he cites the agreement of all the prophets. This is 
truly to cite the authority of the Church. [For when all the holy prophets bear wit-
ness, that is certainly a glorious, great excellent, powerful decretal and testimony.] 
But of this topic we will speak again after a while, when treating of “Repentance.”
84] Fourthly. Remission of sins is something promised for Christ’s sake. There-
fore it cannot be received except by faith alone. For a promise cannot be received 
except by faith alone. Rom. 4:16: Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace, 
to the end that the promise might be sure; as though he were to say: “If the matter 
were to depend upon our merits, the promise would be uncertain and useless, 
because we never could determine when we would have sufficient merit.” And 
this, experienced consciences can easily understand [and would not, for a thousand 
worlds have our salvation depend upon ourselves]. Accordingly, Paul says, Gal. 3:22: 
But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus 
Christ might be given to them that believe. He takes merit away from us, because 
he says that all are guilty and concluded under sin; then he adds that the promise, 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
73
namely, of the remission of sins and of justification, is given, and adds how the 
promise can be received, namely, by faith. And this reasoning, derived from the 
nature of a promise, is the chief reasoning [a veritable rock] in Paul, and is often 
repeated. Nor can anything be devised or imagined whereby this argument of Paul 
can be overthrown. Wherefore 85] let not good minds suffer themselves to be 
forced from the conviction that we receive remission of sins for Christ’s sake, only 
through faith. In this they have sure and firm consolation against the terrors of 
sin, and against eternal death, and against all the gates of hell. [Everything else is a 
foundation of sand that sinks in trials.]
86] But since we receive remission of sins and the Holy Ghost by faith alone, faith 
alone justifies, because those reconciled are accounted righteous and children of 
God, not on account of their own purity, but through mercy for Christ’s sake, pro-
vided only they by faith apprehend this mercy. Accordingly, Scripture testifies that 
by faith we are accounted righteous, Rom. 3:26. We, therefore, will add testimonies 
which clearly declare that faith is that very righteousness by which we are account-
ed righteous before God, namely, not because it is a work that is in itself worthy, 
but because it receives the promise by which God has promised that for Christ’s 
sake He wishes to be propitious to those believing in Him, or because He knows 
that Christ of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, 
and redemption, 1 Cor. 1:30.
87] In the Epistle to the Romans, Paul discusses this topic especially, and declares 
that, when we believe that God, for Christ’s sake, is reconciled to us, we are justi-
fied freely by faith. And this proposition, which contains the statement of the en-
tire discussion [the principal matter of all Epistles, yea, of the entire Scriptures], he 
maintains in the third chapter: We conclude that a man is justified by faith, with-
out the deeds of the Law, Rom. 3:28. Here the adversaries interpret that this refers 
to Levitical ceremonies [not to other virtuous works]. But Paul speaks not only 
of the ceremonies, but of the whole Law. For he quotes afterward (7:7) from the 
Decalog: Thou shalt not covet. And if moral works [that are not Jewish ceremonies] 
would merit the remission of sins and justification, there would also be no need of 
Christ and the promise, and all that Paul speaks of the promise would be over-
thrown. He would also have been wrong in writing to the Ephesians 2:8: By grace 
are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of 
works. Paul likewise refers to Abraham and David, Rom. 4:1,6. But they had the 
command of God concerning circumcision. Therefore, if any works justified, these 
works must also have justified at the time that they had a command. But Augustine 
teaches correctly that Paul speaks of the entire Law, as he discusses at length in his 
book, Of the Spirit and Letter, where he says finally: These matters, therefore hav-
ing been considered and treated, according to the ability that the Lord has thought 
The Lutheran Confessions
74
worthy to give us, we infer that man is not justified by the precepts of a good life, 
but by faith in Jesus Christ.
88] And lest we may think that the sentence that faith justifies, fell from Paul 
inconsiderately, he fortifies and confirms this by a long discussion in the fourth 
chapter to the Romans, and afterwards repeats it in all his epistles. 89] Thus he 
says, Rom. 4:4,5: To him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but 
of debt . But to him that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth the 
ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. Here he clearly says that faith itself 
is imputed for righteousness. Faith, therefore, is that thing which God declares to 
be righteousness, and he adds that it is imputed freely, and says that it could not 
be imputed freely, if it were due on account of works. Wherefore he excludes also 
the merit of moral works [not only Jewish ceremonies, but all other good works]. 
For if justification before God were due to these, faith would not be imputed for 
righteousness 90] without works. And afterwards, Rom. 4:9: For we say that faith 
was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness. 91] Romans 5:1 says: Being justified by 
faith, we have peace with God, i.e., we have consciences that are tranquil and joyful 
92] before God. Rom. 10:10: With the heart man believeth unto righteousness. 
Here he declares that faith is 93] the righteousness of the heart. Gal. 2:16: We have 
believed in Christ Jesus that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not 
by the works of the Law. Eph. 2:8: For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that 
not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast.
94] John 1:12: To them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them 
that believe on His name; which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the 
flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. 95] John 3:14,15: As Moses lifted up the 
serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoev-
er believeth in Him should not perish. 96] Likewise, 3:17: For God sent not His Son 
into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be 
saved. He that believeth on Him is not condemned.
97] Acts 13:38-39: Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through 
this Man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins; and by Him all that believe 
are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the Law of Mo-
ses. How could the office of Christ and justification be declared more clearly? The 
Law, he says, did not justify. Therefore Christ was given, that we may believe that 
for His sake we are justified. He plainly denies justification to the Law. Hence, for 
Christ’s sake we are accounted righteous when we believe that God, for His sake, 
has been reconciled to us. 98] Acts 4:11-12: This is the stone which was set at naught 
of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salva-
tion in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
75
whereby we must be saved. But the name of Christ is apprehended only by faith. [I 
cannot believe in the name of Christ in any other way than when I hear His merit 
preached, and lay hold of that.] Therefore, by confidence in the name of Christ, 
and not by confidence in our works, we are saved. For “the name” here signifies the 
cause which is mentioned, because of which salvation is attained. And to call upon 
the name of Christ is to trust in the name of Christ, as the cause or price because 
of which we are saved. 99] Acts 15:9: Purifying their hearts by faith. Wherefore that 
faith of which the Apostles speak is not idle knowledge, but a reality, receiving the 
Holy Ghost and justifying us [not a mere knowledge of history, but a strong power-
ful work of the Holy Ghost, which changes hearts]
100] Hab. 2:4: The just shall live by his faith. Here he says, first, that men are just 
by faith, by which they believe that God is propitious, and he adds that the same 
faith quickens, because this faith produces in the heart peace and joy and eternal 
life [which begins in the present life].
101] Is. 53:11: By His knowledge shall He justify many. But what is the knowledge of 
Christ unless to know the benefits of Christ, the promises which by the Gospel He 
has scattered broadcast in the world? And to know these benefits is properly and 
truly to believe in Christ, to believe that that which God has promised for Christ’s 
sake He will certainly fulfill.
102] But Scripture is full of such testimonies since, in some places, it presents the 
Law and in others the promises concerning Christ, and the remission of sins, and 
the free acceptance of the sinner for Christ’s sake.
103] Here and there among the Fathers similar testimonies are extant. For 
Ambrose says in his letter to a certain Irenaeus: Moreover, the world was subject to 
Him by the Law for the reason that, according to the command of the Law, all are 
indicted, and yet, by the works of the Law, no one is justified, i.e., because, by the 
Law, sin is perceived, but guilt is not discharged. The Law, which made all sinners, 
seemed to have done injury, but when the Lord Jesus Christ came, He forgave to all 
sin which no one could avoid, and, by the shedding of His own blood, blotted out 
the handwriting which was against us. This is what he says in Rom. 5:20: “The Law 
entered that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much 
more abound.” Because after the whole world became subject, He took away the 
sin of the whole world, as he [John] testified, saying John 1:29: “Behold the Lamb 
of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.” And on this account let no one 
boast of works, because no one is justified by his deeds. But he who is righteous has 
it given him because he was justified after the laver [of Baptism]. Faith, there-
fore, is that which frees through the blood of Christ, because he is blessed “whose 
The Lutheran Confessions
76
transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered,” Ps. 32:1,104] These are the words of 
Ambrose, which clearly favor our doctrine; he denies justification to works, and 
ascribes to faith that it sets us free 105] through the blood of Christ. Let all the 
Sententiarists, who are adorned with magnificent titles, be collected into one heap. 
For some are called angelic; others, subtile, and others irrefragable [that is, doctors 
who cannot err.] When all these have been read and reread, they will not be of as 
much aid for understanding Paul as is this one passage of Ambrose.
106] To the same effect, Augustine writes many things against the Pelagians. 
In Of the Spirit and Letter he says: The righteousness of the Law, namely, that 
he who has fulfilled it shall live in it, is set forth for this reason that when any 
one has recognized his infirmity he may attain and work the same and live in it, 
conciliating the Justifier not by his own strength nor by the letter of the Law itself 
(which cannot be done), but by faith. Except in a justified man, there is no right 
work wherein he who does it may live. But justification is obtained by faith. Here 
he clearly says that the Justifier is conciliated by faith, and that justification is 
obtained by faith. And a little after: By the Law we fear God; by faith we hope in 
God. But to those fearing punishment grace is hidden; and the soul laboring, etc., 
under this fear betakes itself by faith to God’s mercy, in order that He may give 
what He commands. Here he teaches that by the Law hearts are terrified, but by 
faith they receive consolation. He also teaches us to apprehend, by faith, mercy, 
before we attempt to fulfil the Law. We will shortly cite certain other passages.
107] Truly, it is amazing that the adversaries are in no way moved by so many 
passages of Scripture, which clearly ascribe justification to faith, and, indeed, 108] 
deny it to works. Do they think that the same is repeated so often for no purpose? 
Do they think that these words fell inconsiderately from the Holy Ghost? 109] 
But they have also devised sophistry whereby they elude them. They say that these 
passages of Scripture, (which speak of faith,) ought to be received as referring to 
a fides formata, i.e., they do not ascribe justification to faith except on account of 
love. Yea, they do not, in any way, ascribe justification to faith, but only to love, 
because they dream that faith can 110] coexist with mortal sin. Whither does this 
tend, unless that they again abolish the promise and return to the Law? If faith 
receive the remission of sins on account of love, the remission of sins will always be 
uncertain, because we never love as much as we ought, yea, we do not love unless 
our hearts are firmly convinced that the remission of sins has been granted us. 
Thus the adversaries, while they require in the remission of sins and justification 
confidence in one’s own love, altogether abolish the Gospel concerning the free 
remission of sins; although, at the same time, they neither render this love nor 
understand it, unless they believe that the remission of sins is freely received.
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession

111] We also say that love ought to follow faith, as Paul also says, Gal. 5:6: For in 
Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith 
which worketh by love. 112] And yet we must not think on that account that by 
confidence in this love or on account of this love we receive the remission of sins 
and reconciliation, just as we do not receive the remission of sins because of other 
works that follow. But the remission of sins is received by faith alone, and, indeed, 
by faith properly so called, because the promise cannot be received except by faith. 
113] But faith, properly so called, is that which assents to the promise [is when my 
heart, and the Holy Ghost in the heart, says: The promise of God is true and cer-
tain]. Of 114] this faith Scripture speaks. And because it receives the remission of 
sins, and reconciles us to God, by this faith we are [like Abraham] accounted righ-
teous for Christ’s sake before we love and do the works of the Law, although love 
necessarily follows. 115] Nor, indeed, is this faith an idle knowledge, neither can it 
coexist with mortal sin, but it is a work of the Holy Ghost, whereby we are freed 
from death, and terrified minds are encouraged and quickened. 116] And because 
this faith alone receives the remission of sins, and renders us acceptable to God, 
and brings the Holy Ghost, it could be more correctly called gratia gratum faciens, 
grace rendering one pleasing to God, than an effect following, namely, love.
117] Thus far, in order that the subject might be made quite clear, we have shown 
with sufficient fulness, both from testimonies of Scripture, and arguments derived 
from Scripture, that by faith alone we obtain the remission of sins for Christ’s sake, 
and that by faith alone we are justified, i.e., of unrighteous men made righteous, 
or regenerated. 118] But how necessary the knowledge of this faith is, can be easily 
judged, because in this alone the office of Christ is recognized, by this alone we 
receive the benefits of Christ; this alone brings sure and firm 119] consolation 
to pious minds. And in the Church [if there is to be a church, if there is to be a 
Christian Creed] it is necessary that there should be the [preaching and] doctrine 
[by which consciences are not made to rely on a dream or to build on a foundation 
of sand, but] from which the pious may receive the sure hope of salvation. For the 
adversaries give men bad advice [therefore the adversaries are truly unfaithful bish-
ops, unfaithful preachers and doctors; they have hitherto given evil counsel to con-
sciences, and still do so by introducing such doctrine] when they bid them doubt 
whether they obtain remission of sins. For how will such persons sustain them-
selves in death who have heard nothing of this faith, and think that they ought to 
doubt whether they obtain the remission of sins? 120] Besides, it is necessary that 
in the Church of Christ the Gospel be retained, i.e., the promise that for Christ’s 
sake sins are freely remitted. Those who teach nothing of this faith, 121] concern-
ing which we speak, altogether abolish the Gospel. But the scholastics mention 
not even a word concerning this faith. Our adversaries follow them, and reject this

78
faith. Nor do they see that, by rejecting this faith they abolish the entire promise 
concerning the free remission of sins and the righteousness of Christ.
Article III: Of Love and the Fulfilling of the Law.
Shouldn’t this be V (IV II) — in Tappert and Kolb it’s just an extension of the IV, 
Justification. So if anything it should be numbered IV II.
1] Here the adversaries urge against us: If thou wilt enter into life, keep the 
commandments, Matt. 19:17; likewise: The doers of the Law shall be justified, Rom. 
2:13, and many other like things concerning the Law and works. Before we reply to 
this, we must first declare what we believe concerning love and the fulfilling of the 
Law.
2] It is written in the prophet, Jer. 31:33: I will put My Law in their inward parts, 
and write it in their hearts. And in Rom. 3:31, Paul says: Do we, then, make void the 
Law through faith? God forbid! Yea, we establish the Law. And Christ says, Matt. 
19:17: If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. Likewise, 1 Cor. 13:3: If 
I have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. 3] These and similar sentences testify 
that the Law ought to be begun in us, and be kept by us more and more [that we 
are to keep the Law when we have been justified by faith, and thus increase more 
and more in the Spirit]. Moreover, we speak not of ceremonies, but of that Law 
which gives commandment concerning the movements of the heart, namely, the 
Decalog. 4] Because, indeed, faith brings the Holy Ghost, and produces in hearts a 
new life, it is necessary that it should produce spiritual movements in hearts. And 
what these movements are, the prophet, Jer. 31:33 shows, when he says: I will put 
My Law into their inward parts, and write it in their hearts. Therefore, when we 
have been justified by faith and regenerated, we begin to fear and love God, to pray 
to Him, to expect from Him aid, to give thanks and praise Him, and to obey Him 
in afflictions. We begin also to love our neighbors, because our hearts have spiritual 
and holy movements [there is now, through the Spirit of Christ a new heart, mind, 
and spirit within].
5] These things cannot occur until we have been justified by faith, and, regenerated, 
we receive the Holy Ghost: first, because the Law cannot 6] be kept without [the 
knowledge of] Christ; and likewise the Law cannot be kept without the Holy 
Ghost. But the Holy Ghost is received by faith, according to the declaration of 
Paul, Gal. 3:14: That we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 7] 
Then, too, how can the human heart love God while it knows that He is terribly 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
79
angry, and is oppressing us with temporal and perpetual calamities? But the Law 
always accuses us, always shows that God is angry. [Therefore, what the scholastics 
say of the love of God is a dream.] 8] God therefore is not loved until we apprehend 
mercy by faith. Not until then does He become a lovable object.
9] Although, therefore, civil works, i.e., the outward works of the Law, can be done, 
in a measure, without Christ and without the Holy Ghost [from our inborn light], 
nevertheless it appears from what we have said that those things which belong 
peculiarly to the divine Law, i.e., the affections of the heart towards God, which 
are commanded in the first table, cannot be rendered without the Holy Ghost. 10] 
But our adversaries are fine theologians; they regard the second table and political 
works; for the first table [in which is contained the highest theology, on which 
all depends] they care nothing, as though it were of no matter; or certainly they 
require only outward observances. They in no way consider the Law that is eternal, 
and placed far above the sense and intellect of all creatures [which concerns the 
very Deity, and the honor of the eternal Majesty], Deut. 6:5: Thou shalt love the 
Lord, thy God, with all thine heart. [This they treat as such a paltry small matter as 
if it did not belong to theology.]
11] But Christ was given for this purpose, namely, that for His sake there might 
be bestowed on us the remission of sins, and the Holy Ghost to bring forth in us 
new and eternal life, and eternal righteousness [to manifest Christ in our hearts, 
as it is written John 16:15: He shall take of the things of Mine, and show them unto 
you. Likewise, He works also other gifts, love, thanksgiving, charity, patience, 
etc.]. Wherefore the Law cannot be truly kept unless the Holy Ghost be received 
through faith. Accordingly, Paul says that the Law is established by faith, and not 
made void; because the Law can only then be thus kept when the Holy Ghost is 
given. 12] And Paul teaches 2 Cor. 3:15 sq., the veil that covered the face of Moses 
cannot be removed except by faith in Christ, by which the Holy Ghost is received. 
For he speaks thus: But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon 
their heart. Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken 
away. Now the Lord is that Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is 
liberty. 13] Paul understands by the veil the human opinion concerning the entire 
Law, the Decalog and the ceremonies, namely, that hypocrites think that external 
and civil works satisfy the Law of God, and that sacrifices and observances justify 
before God ex opere operato. 14] But then this veil is removed from us, i.e., we 
are freed from this error when God shows to our hearts our uncleanness and the 
heinousness of sin. Then, for the first time, we see that we are far from fulfilling the 
Law. Then we learn to know how flesh, in security and indifference, does not fear 
God, and is not fully certain that we are regarded by God, but imagines that men 
are born and die by chance. Then we experience that we do not believe that God 
The Lutheran Confessions
80
forgives and hears us. But when, on hearing the Gospel and the remission of sins, 
we are consoled by faith, we receive the Holy Ghost so that now we are able to 
think aright concerning God, and to fear and believe God, etc. From these facts it 
is apparent that the Law cannot be kept without Christ and the Holy Ghost.
15] We, therefore, profess that it is necessary that the Law be begun in us, and 
that it be observed continually more and more. And at the same time we compre-
hend both spiritual movements and external good works [the good heart within 
and works without]. Therefore the adversaries falsely charge against us that our 
theologians do not teach good works while they not only require these, but also 
show how they can be done [that the heart must enter into these works, lest they 
be mere, lifeless, cold works of hypocrites]. 16] The result convicts hypocrites, who 
by their own powers endeavor to fulfil the Law, that they cannot accomplish 17] 
what they attempt. [For are they free from hatred, envy, strife, anger, wrath, ava-
rice, adultery, etc.? Why, these vices were nowhere greater than in the cloisters and 
sacred institutes.] For human nature is far too weak to be able by its own powers 
to resist the devil, who holds as captives all who have not been freed through faith. 
18] There is need of the power of Christ against the devil, namely, that, inasmuch 
as we know that for Christ’s sake we are heard, and have the promise, we may pray 
for the governance and defense of the Holy Ghost, that we may neither be deceived 
and err, nor be impelled to undertake anything contrary to God’s will. [Otherwise 
we should, every hour, fall into error and abominable vices.] Just as Ps. 68:18 teach-
es: Thou hast led captivity captive; Thou hast received gifts for man. For Christ has 
overcome the devil, and has given to us the promise and the Holy Ghost, in order 
that, by divine aid, we ourselves also may overcome. And 1 John 3:8: For this pur-
pose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. 
19] Again, we teach not only how the Law can be observed, but also how God is 
pleased if anything be done, namely, not because we render satisfaction to the Law, 
but because we are in Christ, as we shall say after a little. It is, therefore, manifest 
that we require good works. 20] Yea, we add also this, that it is impossible for love 
to God, even though it be small, to be sundered from faith, because through Christ 
we come to the Father, and the remission of sins having been received, we now are 
truly certain that we have a God, i.e., that God cares for us; we call upon Him, we 
give Him thanks, we fear Him, we love Him as 1 John 4:19teaches: We love Him, 
because He first loved us, namely, because He gave His Son for us, and forgave us 
our sins. Thus he indicates that faith precedes and love follows. 21] Likewise the 
faith of which we speak exists in repentance, i.e., it is conceived in the terrors of 
conscience, which feels the wrath of God against our sins, and seeks the remission 
of sins, and to be freed from sin. And in such terrors and other afflictions this faith 
ought to grow and be strengthened. Wherefore 22] it cannot exist in those who live 
according to the flesh who are delighted by their own lusts and obey them. Accord-
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
81
ingly, Paul says, Rom. 8:1: There is, therefore, now no condemnation to them that 
are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. So, too, Rom 
8:12-13: We are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. For if ye live after the 
flesh, ye shall die; but if ye, through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye 
shall live. 23] Wherefore, the faith which receives remission of sins in a heart terri-
fied and fleeing from sin does not remain in those who obey their desires, neither 
does it coexist with mortal sin.
24] From these effects of faith the adversaries select one, namely, love, and teach 
that love justifies. Thus it is clearly apparent that they teach only the Law. They do 
not teach that remission of sins through faith is first received. They do not teach of 
Christ as Mediator, that for Christ’s sake we have a gracious God, but because of 
our love. And yet, what the nature of this love is they do not say, neither 25] can 
they say. They proclaim that they fulfil the Law, although this glory belongs prop-
erly to Christ; and they set against the judgment of God confidence in their own 
works; for they say that they merit de condigno(according to righteousness) grace 
and eternal life. This confidence is absolutely impious and vain. For in this life we 
cannot satisfy the Law, because carnal nature does not cease to bring forth wicked 
dispositions [evil inclination and desire], even though the Spirit in us resists them.
26] But some one may ask: Since we also confess that love is a work of the Holy 
Ghost, and since it is righteousness, because it is the fulfilling of the Law, why do 
we not teach that it justifies? To this we must reply: In the first place, it is certain 
that we receive remission of sins, neither through our love, nor for the sake of 
our love, but for Christ’s sake, by faith alone. 27] Faith alone, which looks upon 
the promise, and knows that for this reason it must be regarded as certain that 
God forgives, because Christ has not died in vain, etc., overcomes the terrors of 
sin and death. 28] If any one doubts whether sins are remitted him, he dishonors 
Christ, since he judges that his sin is greater or more efficacious than the death 
and promise of Christ; although Paul says, Rom. 5:20: Where sin abounded, grace 
did much more abound, i.e., that mercy is 29] more comprehensive [more power-
ful, richer, and stronger] than sin. If any one thinks that he obtains the remission 
of sins because he loves, he dishonors Christ and will discover in God’s judgment 
that this confidence in his own righteousness is wicked and vain. Therefore it is 
necessary that faith [alone] reconciles and 30] justifies. And as we do not receive re-
mission of sins through other virtues of the Law, or on account of these, namely, on 
account of patience, chastity, obedience towards magistrates, etc., and nevertheless 
these virtues ought to follow, so, too, we do not receive remission of sins because 
of love to God, although it is necessary that this should follow. 31] Besides, the 
custom of speech is well known that by the same word we sometimes comprehend 
by synecdoche the cause and effects. Thus in Luke 7:47 Christ says: Her sins, which 
The Lutheran Confessions
82
are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. For Christ interprets Himself [this very 
passage] when He adds: Thy faith hath saved thee. Christ, therefore, did not mean 
that the woman, by that work of love, had merited the remission of sins. For that 
is the reason He says: Thy faith hath saved thee. 32] But faith is that which freely 
apprehends God’s mercy on account of God’s Word [which relies upon God’s mercy 
and Word, and not upon one’s own work]. If any one denies that this is faith [if 
any one imagines that he can rely at the same time upon God and his own works], 
he does not understand at all 33] what faith is. [For the terrified conscience is not 
satisfied with its own works, but must cry after mercy, and is comforted and en-
couraged alone by God’s Word.] And the narrative itself shows in this passage what 
that is which He calls love. The woman came with the opinion concerning Christ 
that with Him the remission of sins should be sought. This worship is the highest 
worship of Christ. Nothing greater could she ascribe to Christ. To seek from Him 
the remission of sins was truly to acknowledge the Messiah. Now, thus to think 
of Christ, thus to worship Him, thus to embrace Him, is truly to believe. Christ, 
moreover, employed the word “love” not towards the woman, but against the 
Pharisee, because He contrasted the entire worship of the Pharisee with the entire 
worship of the woman. He reproved the Pharisee because he did not acknowledge 
that He was the Messiah, although he rendered Him the outward offices due to a 
guest and a great and holy man. He points to the woman and praises her worship, 
ointment, tears, etc., all of which were signs of faith and a confession, namely, that 
with Christ she sought the remission of sins. It is indeed a great example, which, 
not without reason, moved Christ to reprove the Pharisee, who was a wise and 
honorable man, but not a believer. He charges him with impiety, and admonishes 
him by the example of the woman, showing thereby that it is disgraceful to him, 
that, while an unlearned woman believes God, he, a doctor of the Law, does not be-
lieve, does not acknowledge the Messiah, and does not seek from Him remission of 
sins and salvation. 34]Thus, therefore, He praises the entire worship [faith with its 
fruits, but towards the Pharisee He names only the fruits which prove to men that 
there is faith in the heart], as it often occurs in the Scriptures that by one word we 
embrace many things; as below we shall speak at greater length in regard to similar 
passages, such as Luke 11:41: Give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all 
things are clean unto you. He requires not only alms, but also the righteousness 
of faith. Thus He here says: Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved 
much, i.e., because she has truly worshiped Me with faith and the exercises and 
signs of faith. He comprehends the entire worship. Meanwhile He teaches this, 
that the remission of sins is properly received by faith, although love, confession, 
and other good fruits ought to follow. Wherefore He does not mean this, that 
these fruits are the price, or are the propitiation, because of which the remission of 
sins, which reconciles us to God, is given. 35] We are disputing concerning a great 
subject, concerning the honor of Christ, and whence good minds may seek for sure 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
83
and firm consolation, whether confidence is to be placed 36] in Christ or in our 
works. Now, if it is to be placed in our works, the honor of Mediator and Propiti-
ator will be withdrawn from Christ. And yet we shall find, in God’s judgment, that 
this confidence is vain, and that consciences rush thence into despair. But if the 
remission of sins and reconciliation do not occur freely for Christ’s sake, but for 
the sake of our love, no one will have remission of sins, unless when he has fulfilled 
the entire Law, because the Law does not justify as long as it can accuse us. 37] 
Therefore it is manifest that, since justification is reconciliation for Christ’s sake, 
we are justified by faith, because it is very certain that by faith alone the remission 
of sins is received.
38] Now, therefore, let us reply to the objection which we have above stated: [Why 
does love not justify anybody before God?] The adversaries are right in thinking 
that love is the fulfilling of the Law, and obedience to the Law is certainly righ-
teousness. [Therefore it would be true that love justifies us if we would keep the 
Law. But who in truth can say or boast that he keeps the Law, and loves God as 
the Law has commanded? We have shown above that God has made the promise 
of grace, because we cannot observe the Law. Therefore Paul says everywhere that 
we cannot be justified before God by the Law.] But they make a mistake in this 
that they think that we are justified by the Law. [The adversaries have to fail at this 
point, and miss the main issue, for in this business they only behold the Law. For 
all men’s reason and wisdom cannot but hold that we must become pious by the 
Law, and that a person externally observing the Law is holy and pious. But the Gos-
pel faces us about, directs us away from the Law to the divine promises, and teach-
es that we are not justified, etc.] Since, however, we are not justified by the Law 
[because no person can keep it], but receive remission of sins and reconciliation by 
faith for Christ’s sake, and not for the sake of love or the fulfilling of the Law, it 
follows necessarily that we are justified by faith in Christ. [For before we fulfil one 
tittle of the Law, there must be faith in Christ by which we are reconciled to God 
and first obtain the remission of sin. Good God, how dare people call themselves 
Christians or say that they once at least looked into or read the books of the Gos-
pel when they still deny that we obtain remission of sins by faith in Christ? Why, 
to a Christian it is shocking merely to hear such a statement.]
39] Again, [in the second place,] this fulfilling of the Law, or obedience towards 
the Law, is indeed righteousness, when it is complete; but in us it is small and 
impure. [For, although they have received the first-fruits of the Spirit, and the new, 
yea, the eternal life has begun in them, there still remains a remnant of sin and 
evil lust, and the Law still finds much of which it must accuse us.] Accordingly, 
it is not pleasing for its own sake, and is not accepted for its own sake. 40] But 
although from those things which have been said above it is evident that justifi-
The Lutheran Confessions
84
cation signifies not the beginning of the renewal, but the reconciliation by which 
also we afterwards are accepted, nevertheless it can now be seen much more clearly 
that the inchoate fulfilling of the Law does not justify, because it is accepted only 
on account of faith. [Trusting in our own fulfilment of the Law is sheer idolatry 
and blaspheming Christ, and in the end it collapses and causes our consciences to 
despair. Therefore, this foundation shall stand forever, namely, that for Christ’s 
sake we are accepted with God, and justified by faith, not on account of our love 
and works. This we shall make so plain and certain that anybody may grasp it. As 
long as the heart is not at peace with God, it cannot be righteous; for it flees from 
the wrath of God, despairs, and would have God not to judge it. Therefore the 
heart cannot be righteous and accepted with God while it is not at peace with God. 
Now, faith alone makes the heart to be content, and obtains peace and life, Rom. 
5:1, because it confidently and frankly relies on the promise of God for Christ’s 
sake. But our works do not make the heart content, for we always find that they 
are not pure. Therefore it must follow that we are accepted with God, and justified 
by faith alone, when in our hearts we conclude that God desires to be gracious to 
us, not on account of our works and fulfilment of the Law, but from pure grace, 
for Christ’s sake. What can our opponents bring forward against this argument? 
What can they invent and devise against the plain truth? For this is quite certain, 
and experience teaches forcibly enough, that when we truly feel the judgment and 
wrath of God, or become afflicted, our works and worship cannot set the heart at 
rest. Scripture indicates this often enough as in Ps. 143:2: Enter not into judgment 
with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified. Here he clearly 
shows that all the saints, all the pious children of God, who have the Holy Ghost, 
if God would not by grace forgive them their sin, still have remnants of sin in the 
flesh. For when David in another place, Ps. 7:8, says: Judge me O Lord, according to 
my righteousness, he refers to his cause, and not to his righteousness, and asks God 
to protect his cause and word, for he says: Judge, O Lord, my cause. Again, in Ps. 
130:3 he clearly states that no person, not even the greatest saints, can bear God’s 
judgment, if He were to observe our iniquity, as he says: If Thou, Lord, shouldest 
mark iniquity, O Lord, who shall stand? And thus says, Job 9:28: I was afraid of all 
my works (Engl. vers., sorrows). Likewise Job 9:30: If I wash myself with snow-wa-
ter, and make my hands never so clean, yet shalt Thou plunge me in the ditch. And 
Prov. 20:9: Who can say, I have made my heart clean? And 1 John 1:8: If we say that 
we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. And in the Lord’s 
Prayer the saints ask for the forgiveness of sins. Therefore even the saints have guilt 
and sins. Again, in Num. 14:18: The innocent will not be innocent. And Zechariah 
2:13, says: Be silent O all flesh, before the Lord. And Isaiah 40:6 sqq.: All flesh is 
grass, i.e., flesh and righteousness of the flesh cannot endure the judgment of God. 
And Jonah says, 2:8: They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. 
Therefore, pure mercy preserves us; our own works, merits, endeavors, cannot 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
85
preserve us. These and similar declarations in the Scriptures testify that our works 
are unclean, and that we need mercy. Wherefore works do not render consciences 
pacified, but only mercy apprehended by faith does.] Nor must we trust that we are 
accounted righteous before God by our own perfection and fulfilling of the Law, 
but rather for Christ’s sake.
41] First [in the third place], because Christ does not cease to be Mediator after we 
have been renewed. They err who imagine that He has merited only a first grace, 
and that afterwards we please God and merit eternal life by our fulfilling of the 
Law. 42] Christ remains Mediator, and we ought always to be confident that for 
His sake we have a reconciled God, even although we are unworthy. As Paul clearly 
teaches when he says [By whom also we have access to God, Rom. 5:2. For our best 
works, even after the grace of the Gospel has been received, as I stated, are still 
weak and not at all pure. For sin and Adam’s fall are not such a trifling thing as 
reason holds or imagines; it exceeds the reason and thought of all men to under-
stand what a horrible wrath of God has been handed on to us by that disobedience. 
There occurred a shocking corruption of the entire human nature, which no work 
of man, but only God Himself, can restore], 1 Cor. 4:4: I know nothing by myself, 
yet am I not hereby justified, but he knows that by faith he is accounted righteous 
for Christ’s sake, according to the passage: Blessed are they whose iniquities are 
forgiven, Ps. 32:1; Rom. 4:7. [Therefore we need grace, and the gracious goodness of 
God, and the forgiveness of sin, although we have done many good works.] But this 
remission is always received by faith. Likewise, the imputation of the righteousness 
of the Gospel is from the promise; therefore it is always received by faith, and it 
always must be regarded certain that by faith we are, 43] for Christ’s sake, account-
ed righteous. If the regenerate ought afterwards to think that they will be accepted 
on account of the fulfilling of the Law, when would conscience be certain that it 
pleased God, since we never satisfy the Law? 44] Accordingly, we must always re-
cur to the promise; by this our infirmity must be sustained, and we must regard it 
as certain that we are accounted righteous for the sake of Christ, who is ever at the 
right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us, Rom. 8:34. If any one think 
that he is righteous and accepted on account of his own fulfilment of the Law, and 
not on account of Christ’s promise, he dishonors this High Priest. Neither can it be 
understood how one could imagine that man is righteous before God when Christ 
is excluded as Propitiator and Mediator.
45] Again [in the fourth place], what need is there of a long discussion? [If we 
were to think that, after we have come to the Gospel and are born again, we were 
to merit by our works that God be gracious to us, not by faith, conscience would 
never find rest, but would be driven to despair. For the Law unceasingly accuses 
us, since we never can satisfy the Law.] All Scripture, all the Church cries out that 
The Lutheran Confessions
86
the Law cannot be satisfied. Therefore this inchoate fulfilment of the Law does not 
please on its own account, but on account 46] of faith in Christ. Otherwise the 
Law always accuses us. For who loves or fears God sufficiently? Who with sufficient 
patience bears the afflictions imposed by God? Who does not frequently doubt 
whether human affairs are ruled by God’s counsel or by chance? Who does not 
frequently doubt whether he be heard by God? Who is not frequently enraged be-
cause the wicked enjoy a better lot than the pious, because the pious are oppressed 
by the wicked? Who does satisfaction to his own calling? Who loves his neighbor 
as himself? Who is not tempted 47] by lust? Accordingly, Paul says, Rom. 7:19: The 
good that I would I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do. Likewise Rom 
7:25: With the mind I myself serve the Law of God, but with the flesh, the law of 
sin. Here he openly declares that he serves the law of sin. And David says, Ps. 143:2: 
Enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be 
justified. Here even a servant of God prays for the averting of judgment. Likewise 
Ps. 32:2: Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity. Therefore, 
in this our infirmity there is always present sin, which could be imputed, and of 
which he says a little while after, Ps. 32:6: For this shall every one that is godly pray 
unto Thee. Here he shows that even saints ought to seek remission 48] of sins. 
More than blind are those who do not perceive that wicked desires in the flesh 
are sins, of which Paul, Gal. 5:17, says: The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the 
Spirit against the flesh. 49] The flesh distrusts God, trusts in present things, seeks 
human aid in calamities, even contrary to God’s will, flees from afflictions, which 
it ought to bear because of God’s commands, doubts concerning God’s mercy, etc. 
The Holy Ghost in our hearts contends with such dispositions [with Adam’s sin] in 
order to suppress and mortify them [this poison of the old Adam, this desperately 
wicked disposition], 50] and to produce new spiritual movements. But concerning 
this topic we will collect more testimonies below, although they are everywhere 
obvious not only in the Scriptures, but also in the holy Fathers.
51] Well does Augustine say: All the commandments of God are fulfilled when 
whatever is not done, is forgiven. Therefore he requires faith even in good works 
[which the Holy Spirit produces in us], in order that we may believe that for 
Christ’s sake we please God, and that even the works are not of 52] themselves 
worthy and pleasing. And Jerome, against the Pelagians, says: Then, therefore, 
we are righteous when we confess that we are sinners, and that our righteousness 
consists not in our own merit, but in God’s mercy. 53] Therefore, in this inchoate 
fulfilment of the Law, faith ought to be present, which is certain that for Christ’s 
sake we have a reconciled God. For mercy cannot be apprehended unless by faith, 
as has been repeatedly said above. [Therefore those who teach that we are not ac-
cepted by faith for Christ’s sake, but for the sake of our own works, lead conscienc-
es into despair.] 54] Wherefore, when Paul says, Rom. 3:31: We establish the Law 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
87
through faith, by this we ought to understand, not only that those regenerated by 
faith receive the Holy Ghost, and have movements agreeing with God’s Law, but it 
is by far of the greatest importance that we add also this, that we ought to perceive 
that we are far distant from the perfection of the Law. 55] Wherefore we cannot 
conclude that we are accounted righteous before God because of our fulfilling of 
the Law, but in order that the conscience may become tranquil, justification must 
be sought elsewhere. For we are not righteous before God as long as we flee from 
God’s judgment, and are angry with God. 56] Therefore we must conclude that, 
being reconciled by faith, we are accounted righteous for Christ’s sake, not for the 
sake of the Law or our works, but that this inchoate fulfilling of the Law pleases 
on account of faith, and that, on account of faith, there is no imputation of the 
imperfection of the fulfilling of the Law, even though the sight of our impurity 
terrifies us. Now, if justification is to be sought elsewhere, our love 57] and works 
do not therefore justify. Far above our purity, yea, far above the Law itself, ought 
to be placed the death and satisfaction of Christ, presented to us that we might be 
sure that because of this satisfaction, and not because of our fulfilling of the Law, 
we have a gracious God.
58] Paul teaches this in Gal. 3:13, when he says: Christ hath redeemed us from the 
curse of the Law, being made a curse for us, i.e., the Law condemns all men, but 
Christ, because without sin He has borne the punishment of sin, and been made a 
victim for us, has removed that right of the Law to accuse and condemn those who 
believe in Him, because He Himself is the propitiation for them for whose sake 
we are now accounted righteous. But since they are accounted righteous, the Law 
cannot accuse or condemn them, even though they have not actually satisfied the 
Law. To the same purport he writes to the Colossians 2:10: Ye are complete in Him, 
as though he were to say: Although ye are still far from the perfection of the Law, 
yet the remnants of sin do not condemn you, because for Christ’s sake we have a 
sure and firm reconciliation, if you believe, even though sin inhere in your flesh.
59] The promise ought always to be in sight that God, because of His promise, 
wishes for Christ’s sake, and not because of the Law or our works, to be gracious 
and to justify. In this promise timid consciences ought to seek reconciliation and 
justification; by this promise they ought to sustain themselves and be confident 
that for Christ’s sake, because of His promise, they have a gracious God. Thus 
works can never render a conscience pacified, 60] but only the promise can. If, 
therefore, justification and peace of conscience must be sought elsewhere than in 
love and works, love and works do not justify, although they are virtues and per-
tain to the righteousness of the Law, in so far as they are a fulfilling of the Law. So 
far also this obedience of the Law justifies by the righteousness of the Law. But this 
imperfect righteousness of the Law is not accepted by God, unless on account of 
The Lutheran Confessions
88
faith. Accordingly it does not justify, i.e., it neither reconciles, nor regenerates, nor 
by itself renders us accepted before God.
61] From this it is evident that we are justified before God by faith alone [i.e., 
it obtains the remission of sins and grace for Christ’s sake, and regenerates us. 
Likewise, it is quite clear that by faith alone the Holy Ghost is received, again, that 
our works and this inchoate fulfilling of the Law do not by themselves please God. 
Now, even if I abound in good works like Paul or Peter, I must seek my righteous-
ness elsewhere, namely, in the promise of the grace of Christ; again, if only faith 
calms the conscience, it must, indeed, be certain that only faith justifies before 
God. For, if we wish to teach correctly, we must adhere to this, that we are accept-
ed with God, not on account of the Law, not on account of works, but for Christ’s 
sake. For the honor, due Christ, must not be given to the Law or our miserable 
works.] because by faith alone we receive remission of sins and reconciliation, be-
cause reconciliation or justification is a matter promised for Christ’s sake, and not 
for the sake of the Law. Therefore it is received by faith alone, although, when the 
Holy Ghost is given, the fulfilling of the Law follows.
Reply to the Arguments of the Adversaries.
62] Now, when the grounds of this case have been understood, namely, the 
distinction between the Law and the promises, or the Gospel, it will be easy to 
resolve the objections of the adversaries. For they cite passages concerning the Law 
and works, and omit passages concerning the promises. 63] But a reply can once 
for all be made to all opinions concerning the Law, namely, that the Law cannot 
be observed without Christ, and that if civil works are wrought without Christ, 
they do not please God. [God is not pleased with the person.] Wherefore, when 
works are commended, it is necessary to add that faith is required, that they are 
commended on account of faith, that they are the fruits and testimonies of faith. 
[This our doctrine is, indeed, plain; it need not fear the light, and may be held 
against the Holy Scriptures. We have also clearly and correctly presented it here, 
if any will receive instruction and not knowingly deny the truth. For rightly to 
understand the benefit of Christ and the great treasure of the Gospel (which Paul 
extols so greatly), we must separate, on the one hand, the promise of God and the 
grace that is offered, and, on the other hand, the Law, as far as the heavens are from 
the earth. In shaky matters many explanations are needed, but in a good matter 
one or two thoroughgoing explanations dissolve all objections which men think 
they can raise.] 64] Ambiguous and dangerous cases produce many and various 
solutions. For the judgment of the ancient poet is true: “An unjust cause, being in 
itself sick, requires skilfully applied remedies.”
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
89
But in just and sure cases one or two explanations derived from the sources correct 
all things that seem to offend. This occurs also in this case of ours. For the rule 
which I have just recited, explains all the passages that are cited concerning the 
Law 65] and works [namely, that without Christ the Law cannot be truly observed, 
and although external works may be performed, still the person doing them does 
not please God outside of Christ]. For we acknowledge that Scripture teaches in 
some places the Law, and in other places the Gospel, or the gratuitous promise of 
the remission of sins for Christ’s sake. But our adversaries absolutely abolish the 
free promise when they deny that faith justifies, and teach that for the sake of love 
and of our works we receive remission of sins and 66] reconciliation. If the remis-
sion of sins depends upon the condition of our works, it is altogether uncertain. 
[For we can never be certain whether we do enough works, or whether our works 
are sufficiently holy and pure. Thus, too, the forgiveness of sins is made uncertain, 
and the promise of God perishes, as Paul says, Rom. 4:14: The promise is made of 
none effect, and everything is rendered uncertain.] Therefore the promise will be 
abolished. 67] Hence we refer godly minds to the consideration of the promises, 
and we teach concerning the free remission of sins and concerning reconciliation, 
which occurs through faith in Christ. Afterwards we add also the doctrine of the 
Law. [Not that by the Law we merit the remission of sins, or that for the sake of 
the Law we are accepted with God, but because God requires good works.] And 
it is necessary to divide these things aright, as Paul says, 2 Tim. 2:15. We must see 
what Scripture ascribes to the Law and what to the promises. For it praises works 
in such a way as not to remove the free promise [as to place the promise of God 
and the true treasure, Christ, a thousand leagues above it].
68] For good works are to be done on account of God’s command, likewise for the 
exercise of faith [as Paul says, Eph. 2:10: We are His workmanship, created in Christ 
Jesus unto good works], and on account of confession and giving of thanks. For 
these reasons good works ought necessarily to be done, which, although they are 
done in the flesh not as yet entirely renewed, that retards the movements of the 
Holy Ghost, and imparts some of its uncleanness, yet, on account of Christ, are 
holy, divine works, sacrifices, and acts pertaining to the government of Christ, who 
thus displays His kingdom before this world. For in these He sanctifies hearts and 
represses the devil, and, in order to retain the Gospel among men, openly opposes 
to the kingdom of the devil the confession of saints, and, in our weakness, declares 
His power. 69] The dangers, labors, and sermons of the Apostle Paul, of Athana-
sius, Augustine, and the like, who taught the churches, are holy works, are true 
sacrifices acceptable to God, are contests of Christ 70] through which He repressed 
the devil, and drove him from those who believed. David’s labors, in waging wars 
and in his home government, are holy works, are true sacrifices, are contests of 
God, defending the people who had the Word of God against 71] the devil, in 
The Lutheran Confessions
90
order that the knowledge of God might not be entirely extinguished on earth. We 
think thus also concerning every good work in the humblest callings and in private 
affairs. Through these works Christ celebrates His victory over the devil, just as the 
distribution of alms by the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 16:1, was a holy work, and a sacrifice 
and contest of Christ against the devil, who labors that nothing may be done 72] 
for the praise of God. To disparage such works, the confession of doctrine, afflic-
tion, works of love, mortifications of the flesh, would be indeed to disparage the 
outward government of Christ’s kingdom among men. 73] Here also we add some-
thing concerning rewards and merits. We teach that rewards have been offered 
and promised to the works of believers. We teach that good works are meritorious, 
not for the remission of sins, for grace or justification (for these we obtain only 
by faith), but for other rewards, bodily and spiritual, in this life and after this life, 
because Paul 74] says, 1 Cor. 3:8: Every man shall receive his own reward, according 
to his own labor. There will, therefore be different rewards according to different 
labors. But the remission of sins is alike and equal to all, just as Christ is one, and 
is offered freely to all who believe that for Christ’s sake their sins are remitted. 
Therefore the remission of sins and justification are received only by faith, and 
not on account of any works, as is evident in the terrors of conscience, because 
none of our works can be opposed to God’s wrath, as Paul clearly says, Rom. 5:1: 
Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by 
whom also we have access by faith, etc. 75] But because faith makes sons of God, it 
also makes coheirs with Christ. Therefore, because by our works we do not merit 
justification, through which we are made sons of God, and coheirs with Christ, we 
do not by our works merit eternal life; for faith obtains this, because faith justifies 
us and has a reconciled God. But eternal life is due the justified, according to the 
passage Rom. 8:30: Whom He justified, them He also glorified. 76] Paul, Eph. 6:2, 
commends to us the commandment concerning honoring parents, by mention of 
the reward which is added to that commandment, where he does not mean that 
obedience to parents justifies 77] us before God, but that, when it occurs in those 
who have been justified, it merits other great rewards. Yet God exercises His saints 
variously, and often defers the rewards of the righteousness of works in order that 
they may learn not to trust in their own righteousness, and may learn to seek the 
will of God rather than the rewards; as appears in Job, in Christ, and other saints. 
And of this, many psalms teach us, which console us against the happiness of the 
wicked, as Ps. 37:1: Neither be thou envious. And Christ says, Matt. 5:10: Blessed are 
they 78] which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake; for theirs is the kingdom of 
heaven. By these 79] praises of good works, believers are undoubtedly moved to do 
good works. Meanwhile, the doctrine of repentance is also proclaimed against the 
godless, whose works are wicked; and the wrath of God is displayed, 80] which He 
has threatened all who do not repent. We therefore praise and require good works, 
and show many reasons why they ought to be done.
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
91
Thus of works Paul also teaches when he says, Rom. 4:9 sq., that Abraham received 
circumcision, not in order that by this work he might be justified; for by faith 
he had already attained it that he was accounted righteous. But circumcision was 
added in order that he might have in his body a written sign, admonished by which 
he might exercise faith, and by which also he might confess his faith before others, 
and, by his testimony, might invite others to believe. 81] By faith Abel offered unto 
God a more excellent sacrifice, Heb. 11:4. Because, therefore, he was just by faith, 
the sacrifice which he made was pleasing to God; not that by this work he merited 
the remission of sins and grace, but that he exercised his faith and showed it to 
others, in order to invite them to believe.
82] Although in this way good works ought to follow faith, men who cannot 
believe and be sure that for Christ’s sake they are freely forgiven, and that freely for 
Christ’s sake they have a reconciled God, employ works far otherwise. When they 
see the works of saints, they judge in a human manner that saints have merited the 
remission of sins and grace through these works. Accordingly, they imitate them, 
and think that through similar works they merit the remission of sins and grace; 
they think that through these works they appease the wrath of God, and attain that 
for the sake of these works they are accounted righteous. 83] This godless opinion 
concerning works we condemn. In the first place, because it obscures the glory of 
Christ when men offer to God these works as a price and propitiation. This honor, 
due to Christ alone, is ascribed to our works. Secondly, they nevertheless do not 
find, in these works, peace of conscience, but in true terrors, heaping up works 
upon works, they at length despair because they find no work sufficiently pure 
[sufficiently important and precious to propitiate God, to obtain with certainty 
eternal life, in a word, to tranquilize and pacify the conscience]. The Law always 
accuses, and produces wrath. Thirdly, such persons never attain the knowledge of 
God [nor of His will]; for, as in anger they flee from God, who judges and afflicts 
them, they never believe that they are heard. 84] But faith manifests the presence 
of God, since it is certain that God freely forgives and hears us.
85] Moreover, this godless opinion concerning works always has existed in the 
world [sticks to the world quite tightly]. The heathen had sacrifices, derived from 
the fathers. They imitated their works. Their faith they did not retain, but thought 
that the works were a propitiation and price on account of which God would be 
reconciled to them. 86] The people in the Law [the Israelites] imitated sacrifices 
with the opinion that by means of these works they would appease God, so to say, 
ex opere operato. We see here how earnestly the prophets rebuke the people: Ps. 
50:8: I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices, and Jer. 7:22: I spake not unto your 
fathers concerning burnt offerings. Such passages condemn not works, which 
God certainly had commanded as outward exercises in this government, but they 
The Lutheran Confessions
92
condemn the godless opinion according to which they thought that by these works 
they appeased the wrath of God, and 87] thus cast away faith. And because no 
works pacify the conscience, new works, in addition to God’s commands, were 
from time to time devised [the hypocrites nevertheless used to invent one work 
after another, one sacrifice after another, by a blind guess and in reckless wanton-
ness, and all this without the word and command of God, with wicked conscience 
as we have seen in the Papacy]. The people of Israel had seen the prophets sacrific-
ing on high places [and in groves]. Besides, the examples of the saints very greatly 
move the minds of those, hoping by similar works to obtain grace just as these 
saints obtained it. [But the saints believed.] Wherefore the people began, with 
remarkable zeal, to imitate this work, in order that by such a work [they might 
appease the wrath of God] they might merit remission of sins, grace, and righteous-
ness. But the prophets had been sacrificing on high places, not that by these works 
they might merit the remission of sins and grace, but because on these places they 
taught, and, accordingly, presented there a testimony of their faith. 88] The people 
had heard that Abraham had sacrificed his son. Wherefore they also, in order 
to appease God by a most cruel and difficult work, put to death their sons. But 
Abraham did not sacrifice his son with the opinion that this work was a price and 
propitiatory work for the sake of which he was accounted righteous. 89] Thus in 
the Church the Lord’s Supper was instituted that by remembrance of the promises 
of Christ, of which we are admonished in this sign, faith might be strengthened in 
us, and we might publicly confess our faith, and proclaim the benefits of Christ, as 
Paul says, 1 Cor. 11:26: As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do show 
the Lord’s death, etc. But our adversaries contend that the mass is a work that justi-
fies us ex opere operato, and removes the guilt and liability to punishment in those 
for whom it is celebrated; for thus writes Gabriel.
90] Anthony, Bernard, Dominicus, Franciscus, and other holy Fathers selected a 
certain kind of life either for the sake of study [of more readily reading the Holy 
Scriptures] or other useful exercises. In the mean time they believed that by faith 
they were accounted righteous for Christ’s sake, and that God was gracious to 
them, not on account of those exercises of their own. But the multitude since then 
has imitated not the faith of the Fathers, but their example without faith, in order 
that by such works they might merit the remission of sins, grace, and righteous-
ness; they did not believe that they received these freely on account of Christ as 
Propitiator. [Thus the human mind always exalts works too highly, and puts them 
in the wrong place. And this error the Gospel reproves, which teaches that men are 
accounted righteous not for the sake of the Law, but for the sake of Christ alone. 
Christ, however, is apprehended by faith alone; wherefore we are accounted righ-
teous by faith alone for Christ’s sake.] Thus the world judges of all works 91] that 
they are a propitiation by which God is appeased; that they are a price because of 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
93
which we are accounted righteous. It does not believe that Christ is Propitiator; it 
does not believe that by faith we freely attain that we are accounted righteous for 
Christ’s sake. And, nevertheless, since works cannot pacify the conscience, others 
are continually chosen, new rites are performed, new vows made, and new orders 
of monks formed beyond the command of God, in order that 92] some great work 
may be sought which may be set against the wrath and judgment of God. Contrary 
to Scripture, the adversaries uphold these godless opinions concerning works. But 
to ascribe to our works these things, namely, that they are a propitiation, that they 
merit the remission of sins and grace, that for the sake of these and not by faith, 
for the sake of Christ as Propitiator we are accounted righteous before God, what 
else is this than to deny Christ the honor of Mediator and 93] Propitiator? Al-
though, therefore, we, believe and teach that good works must necessarily be done 
(for the inchoate fulfilling of the Law ought to follow faith), nevertheless we give 
to Christ His own honor. We believe and teach that by faith, for Christ’s sake, we 
are accounted righteous before God, that we are not accounted righteous because 
of works without Christ as Mediator, that by works we do not merit the remission 
of sins, grace, and righteousness, that we cannot set our works against the wrath 
and justice of God, that works cannot overcome the terrors of sin, but that the 
terrors of sin are overcome by faith alone, 94] that only Christ the Mediator is to 
be presented by faith against the wrath and judgment of God. If any one think dif-
ferently, he does not give Christ due honor, who has been set forth that He might 
be a Propitiator, that through Him 95] we might have access to the Father. We 
are speaking now of the righteousness through which we treat with 96] God, not 
with men, but by which we apprehend grace and peace of conscience. Conscience 
however, cannot be pacified before God, unless by faith alone, which is certain 
that God for Christ’s sake is reconciled to us, according to Rom. 5:1: Being justified 
by faith, we have peace, because justification is only a matter freely promised for 
Christ’s sake, and therefore is always received before God by faith alone.
97] Now, then, we will reply to those passages which the adversaries cite, in order 
to prove that we are justified by love and works. From 1 Cor. 13:2 they cite: Though 
I have all faith, etc., and have not charity, I am nothing. And here they triumph 
greatly. Paul testifies to the entire Church, they say, that faith alone does not 
justify. 98] But a reply is easy after we have shown above what we hold concerning 
love and works. This passage of Paul requires love. We also require this. For we 
have said above that renewal and the inchoate fulfilling of the Law must exist in 
us, according to Jer. 31:33: I will put My Law in their inward parts, and write it in 
their hearts. If any one should cast away love, even though he have great faith, yet 
he does not retain it, 99] for he does not retain the Holy Ghost [he becomes cold 
and is now again fleshly, without Spirit and faith; for the Holy Ghost is not where 
Christian love and other fruits of the Spirit are not]. Nor indeed does Paul in this 
The Lutheran Confessions
94
passage treat of the mode of justification, but he writes to those who, after they 
had been justified, should be urged to bring forth good fruits lest they might lose 
the Holy Ghost. 100] The adversaries furthermore, treat the matter preposterously: 
they cite this one passage, in which Paul teaches concerning fruits, they omit very 
many other passages, in which in a regular order he discusses the mode of justifi-
cation. Besides, they always add a correction to the other passages, which treat of 
faith, namely, that they ought to be understood as applying to fides formata. Here 
they add no correction that there is also need of the faith that holds that we are 
accounted righteous for the sake of Christ as Propitiator. Thus the adversaries ex-
clude Christ from justification and teach only a righteousness of the Law. But let us 
return to Paul. 101] No one can infer anything more from this text than that love is 
necessary. This we confess. So also not to commit theft is necessary. But the reason-
ing will not be correct if some one would desire to frame thence an argument such 
as this: “Not to commit theft is necessary. Therefore, not to commit theft justifies.” 
Because justification is not the approval of a certain work, but of the entire person. 
Hence this passage from Paul does not harm us; only the adversaries must not in 
imagination add to it whatever they please. For he does not say that love justifies, 
but: [“And if I have not love”] “I am nothing,” namely, that faith, however great it 
may have been, is extinguished. He does not say that love overcomes the terrors of 
sin and of death, that we can set our love against the wrath and judgment of God, 
that our love satisfies God’s Law, that without Christ as Propitiator we have access, 
by our love, to God, that by our love we receive the promised remission of sins. 
Paul says nothing of this. He does not, therefore, think that love justifies, because 
we are justified only when we apprehend Christ as Propitiator, and believe that for 
Christ’s sake God is reconciled to us. Neither is justification even to be dreamed 
of with the omission of Christ as Propitiator. 102] If there be no need of Christ, if 
by our love we can overcome death, if by our love, without Christ as Propitiator, 
we have access to God, then let our adversaries remove the promise concerning 
Christ, then let them abolish the Gospel [which teaches that we have access to God 
through Christ as Propitiator, and that we are accepted not for the sake of our 
fulfilling of the Law, but for Christ’s sake]. 103] The adversaries corrupt very many 
passages, because they bring to them their own opinions, and do not derive the 
meaning from the passages themselves. For what difficulty is there in this passage 
if we remove the interpretation which the adversaries, who do not understand 
what justification is or how it occurs [what faith is, what Christ is, or how a man 
is justified before God], out of their own mind attach to it? The Corinthians, being 
justified before, had received many excellent gifts. In the beginning they glowed 
with zeal, just as is generally the case. Then dissensions [factions and sects] began to 
arise among them, as Paul indicates; they began to dislike good teachers. Accord-
ingly, Paul reproves them, recalling them [to unity and] to offices of love. Although 
these are necessary, yet it would be foolish to imagine that works of the Second 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
95
Table, through which we have to do with man and not properly with God, justify 
us. But in justification we have to treat with God; His wrath must be appeased and 
conscience must be pacified with respect to God. None of these occur through the 
works of the Second Table [by love, but only by faith, which apprehends Christ 
and the promise of God. However, it is true that losing love involves losing the 
Spirit and faith. And thus Paul says: If I have not love, I am nothing. But, he does 
not add the affirmative statement, that love justifies in the sight of God].
104] But they object that love is preferred to faith and hope. For Paul says, 1 Cor. 
13:13: The greatest of these is charity. Now, it is reasonable that the greatest and 
chief virtue should justify, 105] although Paul, in this passage, properly speaks of 
love towards one’s neighbor, and indicates that love is the greatest, because it has 
most fruits. Faith and hope have to do only with God; but love has infinite offices 
externally towards men. [Love goes forth upon earth among the people, and does 
much good, by consoling, teaching, instructing, helping, counseling privately and 
publicly.] Nevertheless, let us, indeed, grant to the adversaries that love towards 
God and our neighbor is the greatest virtue, because the chief commandment is 
this: Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, Matt. 22:37. But how will they infer thence 
that love justifies? 106] The greatest virtue, they say, justifies. By no means. [It 
would be true if we had a gracious God because of our virtue. Now, it was proven 
above that we are accepted and justified for Christ’s sake, not because of our virtue; 
for our virtue is impure.] For just as even the greatest or first Law does not justify, 
so also the greatest virtue of the Law does not justify. [For as the Law and virtue is 
higher, and our ability to do the same proportionately lower, we are not righteous 
because of love.] But that virtue justifies which apprehends Christ, which commu-
nicates to us Christ’s merits, by which we receive grace and peace from God. But 
this virtue is faith. For as it has been often said, faith is not only knowledge, but 
much rather willing to receive or apprehend those things which are offered in the 
promise concerning Christ. 107] Moreover this obedience towards God, namely, 
to wish to receive the offered promise, is no less a divine service, latreiva, than is 
love. God wishes us to believe Him, and to receive from Him blessings, and this He 
declares to be true divine service.
108] But the adversaries ascribe justification to love because they everywhere 
teach and require the righteousness of the Law. For we cannot deny that love is 
the highest work of the Law. And human wisdom gazes at the Law, and seeks in 
it justification. Accordingly, also the scholastic doctors, great and talented men, 
proclaim this as the highest work of the Law, and ascribe to this work justification. 
But deceived by human wisdom, they did not look upon the uncovered, but upon 
the veiled face of Moses, just as the Pharisees, philosophers, Mahometans. 109] But 
we preach the foolishness of the Gospel, in which another righteousness is revealed 
The Lutheran Confessions
96
namely, that for the sake of Christ, as Propitiator, we are accounted righteous, 
when we believe that for Christ’s sake God has been reconciled to us. Neither are 
we ignorant how far distant this doctrine is from the judgment of reason and of 
the Law. Nor are we ignorant that the doctrine of the Law concerning love makes 
a much greater show; for it is wisdom. But we are not ashamed of the foolishness 
of the Gospel. For the sake of Christ’s glory we defend this, and beseech Christ, by 
His Holy Ghost, to aid us that we may be able to make this clear and manifest.
110] The adversaries, in the Confutation, have also cited against us Col. 3:14: 
Charity, which is the bond of perfectness. From this they infer that love justifies 
because it renders men perfect. Although a reply concerning perfection could here 
be made in many ways, yet we will simply recite the meaning of Paul. It is certain 
that Paul spoke of love towards one’s neighbor. Neither must we indeed think that 
Paul would ascribe either justification or perfection to the works of the Second 
Table, rather than to those of the First. And if love render men perfect, there will 
then be no need of Christ as Propitiator, [However, Paul teaches in all places that 
we are accepted on account of Christ and not on account of our love, or our works, 
or of the Law; for no saint (as was stated before) perfectly fulfils the Law. There-
fore since he in all places writes and teaches that in this life there is no perfection 
in our works, it is not to be thought that he speaks here of personal perfection.] 
for faith apprehends Christ only as Propitiator. This, however, is far distant from 
the meaning of Paul, who never suffers 111] Christ to be excluded as Propitiator. 
Therefore he speaks not of personal perfection, but of the integrity common to the 
Church [concerning the unity of the Church, and the word which they interpret 
as perfection means nothing else than to be not rent]. For on this account he says 
that love is a bond or connection, to signify that he speaks of the binding and 
joining together with each other, of the many members of the Church. For just as 
in all families and in all states concord should be nourished by mutual offices, and 
tranquillity cannot be retained unless men overlook and forgive certain mistakes 
among themselves; so Paul commands that there should be love in the Church in 
order that it may preserve concord, bear with the harsher manners of brethren as 
there is need, overlook certain less serious mistakes, lest the Church fly apart into 
various schisms, and enmities and factions and heresies arise from the schisms.
112] For concord must necessarily be rent asunder whenever either the bishops 
impose, [without cause] upon the people heavier burdens, or have no respect to 
weakness in the people. And dissensions arise when the, people judge too severely 
[quickly censur, and criticize] concerning. the conduct [wall and life] of teachers 
[bishops or preachers] or despise the teachers because of certain less serious faults; 
for then both another kind of doctrine and other teachers are sought after. 113] On 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
97
the other hand, perfection, i. e the integrity of the Church, is preserved, when the 
strong bear with the weak, when the people take in good part some faults in the 
conduct of their teachers [have patience also with their preachers], when the bish-
ops make some allowances for the weakness of the people [know how to exercise 
forbearance to the people, according to circumstances, with respect to all kinds of 
weaknesses and faults]. 114] Of these precepts of equity the books of all the wise 
are full, namely, that in every-day life we should make many allowances mutually 
for the sake of common tranquillity. And of this Paul frequently teaches both here 
and elsewhere. Wherefore the adversaries argue indiscreetly from. the term “per-
fection” that love justifies, while Paul speaks of common integrity and tranquillity. 
And thus Ambrose interprets this passage: Just as a building is said to be perfect or 
entire when all its parts are fitly joined together with one another. 115] Moreover, 
it is disgraceful for the adversaries to preach so much concerning love while they 
nowhere exhibit it. What are they now doing? They are rending asunder churches, 
they are writing laws in blood, and are proposing to the most clement prince, the 
Emperor, that these should be promulgated; they are slaughtering priests and other 
good men, if any one have [even] slightly intimated that he does not entirely ap-
prove some manifest abuse. [They wish all dead who say a single word against their 
godless doctrine.] These things are not consistent with those declamations of love, 
which if the adversaries would follow, the churches would be tranquil and the state 
have peace. For these tumults would be quieted if the adversaries would not insist 
with too much bitterness [from sheer vengeful spite and pharisaical envy, against 
the truth which they have perceived] upon certain traditions, useless for godliness, 
most of which not even those very persons observe who most earnestly defend 
them. But they easily forgive themselves, and yet do not likewise forgive others 
according to the passage in the poet: I forgive myself, Maevius said. 116] But this 
is very far distant from those encomiums of love which they here recite from Paul, 
nor do they understand the word any more than the walls which give it back. 117] 
From Peter they cite also this sentence, 1 Pet. 4:8: Charity shall cover the multitude 
of sins. It is evident that also Peter speaks of love towards one’s neighbor, because 
he joins this passage to the precept by which he commands that they should love 
one another. Neither could it have come into the mind of any apostle that our love 
overcomes sin and death; that love is the propitiation on account of which to the 
exclusion of Christ as Mediator, God is reconciled; that love is righteousness with-
out Christ as Mediator. For this love, if there would be any, would be a righteous-
ness of the Law, and not of the Gospel, which promises to us reconciliation and 
righteousness if we believe that, for the sake of Christ as Propitiator, the Father has 
been reconciled, and that the merits of Christ are bestowed upon us. 118] Peter, 
accordingly, urges us, a little before, to come to Christ that we may be built upon 
Christ. And he adds, 1 Pet. 2:4-6: He that believeth on Him shall not be confound-
ed. When God judges and convicts us, our love does not free us from confusion 
The Lutheran Confessions
98
[from our works and lives, we truly suffer shame]. But faith in Christ liberates us in 
these fears, because we know that for Christ’s sake we are forgiven.
119] Besides, this sentence concerning love is derived from Prov. 10:12, where the 
antithesis clearly shows how it ought to be understood: Hatred stirreth up strifes; 
but love covereth all sins. 120] It teaches precisely the same thing as that passage 
of Paul taken from Colossians, that if any dissensions would occur they should be 
moderated and settled by our equitable and lenient conduct. Dissensions, it says, 
increase by means of hatred, as we often see that from the most trifling offenses 
tragedies arise [from the smallest sparks a great conflagration arises]. Certain tri-
fling offenses occurred between Caius Caesar and Pompey, in which, if the one had 
yielded a very little to the other, civil war would not have arisen. But while each 
indulged his own hatred, from a matter of no account the greatest commotions 
arose. 121] And many heresies have arisen in the Church only from the hatred of 
the teachers. Therefore it does not refer to a person’s own faults, but to the faults 
of others, when it says: Charity covereth sins, namely, those of others, and that, 
too, among men, i.e., even though these offenses occur, yet love overlooks them, 
forgives, yields, and does not carry all things to the extremity of justice. Peter, 
therefore, does not mean that love merits in God’s sight the remission of sins, that 
it is a propitiation to the exclusion of Christ as Mediator, that it regenerates and 
justifies, but that it is not morose, harsh, intractable towards men, that it overlooks 
some mistakes of its friends, that it takes in good part even the harsher manners of 
others, just as the well-known maxim enjoins: Know, but do not hate, the manners 
of a friend. 122] Nor was it without design that the apostle taught so frequently 
concerning this office what the philosophers call ejpieivkeian, leniency. For this 
virtue is necessary for retaining public harmony [in the Church and the civil gov-
ernment], which cannot last unless pastors and Churches mutually overlook and 
pardon many things [if they want to be extremely particular about every defect, 
and do not allow many things to flow by without noticing them].
123] From James 2:24 they cite: Ye see, then, how by works a man is justified, and 
not by faith alone. Nor is any other passage supposed to be more contrary to our 
belief. But the reply is easy and plain. If the adversaries do not attach their own 
opinions concerning the merits of works, the words of James have in them nothing 
that is of disadvantage. But wherever there is mention of works, the adversaries 
add falsely their own godless opinions, that by means of good works we merit 
the remission of sins; that good works are a propitiation and price on account of 
which God is reconciled to us; that good works overcome the terrors of sin and of 
death, that good works are accepted in God’s sight on account of their goodness; 
and that they do not need mercy and Christ as Propitiator. None of all these things 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
99
came into the mind of James, which the adversaries nevertheless, defend under the 
pretext of this passage of James.
124] In the first place, then, we must ponder, this, namely, that the passage is 
more against the adversaries than against us. For the adversaries teach that man is 
justified by love and works. Of faith, by which we apprehend Christ as Propitiator, 
they say nothing. Yea, they condemn this faith, nor do they condemn it only 
in sentences and writings, but also by the sword and capital punishments they 
endeavor to exterminate it in the Church. How much better does James teach, who 
does not omit faith, or present love in preference to faith, but retains faith, so that 
in justification Christ may not be excluded as Propitiator! Just as Paul also, when 
he treats of the sum of the Christian life, includes faith and love, 1 Tim. 1:5: The 
end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, 
and of faith unfeigned.
125] Secondly, the subject itself declares that here such works are spoken of as 
follow faith, and show that faith is not dead, but living and efficacious in the heart. 
James, therefore, did not believe that by good works we merit the remission of sins 
and grace. For he speaks of the works of those who have been justified, who have 
already been reconciled and accepted, and have obtained remission of sins. Where-
fore the adversaries err when they infer that James teaches that we merit remission 
of sins and grace by good works, and that by our works we have access to God, 
without Christ as Propitiator.
126] Thirdly, James has spoken shortly before concerning regeneration, namely, 
that it occurs through the Gospel. For thus he says James 1:18: Of His own will 
begat He us with the Word of Truth, that we should be a kind of first-fruits of His 
creatures. When he says that we have been born again by the Gospel, he teaches 
that we have been born again and justified by faith. For the promise concerning 
Christ is apprehended only by faith, when we set it against the terrors of sin and of 
death. James does not, therefore, think that we are born again by our works.
127] From these things it is clear that James does not contradict us, who, when 
censuring idle and secure minds, that imagine that they have faith, although they 
do not have it, made a distinction between dead and living faith. 128] He says that 
that is dead which does not bring forth good works [and fruits of the Spirit obe-
dience, patience, chastity, love]; he says that that is living which brings forth good 
works. Furthermore, we have frequently already shown what we term faith. For we 
do not speak of idle knowledge [that merely the history concerning Christ should 
be known], such as devils have, but of faith which resists the terrors of conscience, 
The Lutheran Confessions
100
and cheers and consoles terrified hearts [the new light and power which the Holy 
Ghost works in the heart, through which we overcome the terrors of death, of sin, 
etc.]. 129] Such faith is neither an easy matter, as the adversaries dream [as they 
say: Believe, believe, how easy it is to believe! etc.], nor a human power [thought 
which I can form for myself], but a divine power, by which we are quickened, and 
by which we overcome the devil and death. Just as Paul says to the Colossians 2:12 
that faith is efficacious through the power of God, and overcomes death: Wherein 
also ye are risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God. Since this 
faith is a new life, it necessarily produces new movements and works. [Because it is 
a new light and life in the heart, whereby we obtain another mind and spirit, it is 
living, productive, and rich in good works.] Accordingly, James is right in denying 
that we are justified by such a faith as is 130] without works. But when he says 
that we are justified by faith and works, he certainly does not say that we are born 
again by works. Neither does he say this, that partly Christ is our Propitiator, and 
partly our works are our propitiation. Nor does he describe the mode of justifica-
tion, but only of what nature the just are, after they have been already justified and 
regenerated. [For he is speaking of works which should follow faith. There it is well 
said: He who has faith and good works is righteous, not indeed, on account of the 
works, but for Christ’s sake, through faith. And as a good tree should bring forth 
good fruit, and yet the fruit does not make the tree good, so good works must fol-
low the new birth, although they do not make man accepted before God; but as the 
tree must first be good, so also must man be first accepted before God by faith for 
Christ’s sake. The works are too insignificant to render God gracious to us for their 
sake, if He were not gracious to us for Christ’s sake. Therefore James does not con-
tradict St. Paul, and does not say that by our works we merit, etc.] 131] And here 
to be justified does not mean that a righteous man is made from a wicked man, 
but to be pronounced righteous in a forensic sense, as also in the passage Rom. 2:13: 
The doers of the Law shall be justified. As, therefore, these words: The doers of the 
Law shall be justified, contain nothing contrary to our doctrine, so, too, we believe 
concerning the words of James: By works a man is justified, and not by faith alone, 
because men having faith and good works are certainly pronounced righteous. For, 
as we have said, the good works of saints are righteous, and please on account of 
faith. For James commends only such works as faith produces, as he testifies when 
he says of Abraham, James 2:22: Faith wrought with his works. In this sense it is 
said: The doers of the Law are justified, i.e., they are pronounced righteous who 
from the heart believe God, and afterwards have good fruits, which please Him on 
account of faith, and, accordingly, are the fulfilment of the Law. 
132] These things, simply spoken, contain nothing erroneous, but they are dis-
torted by the adversaries, who attach to them godless opinions out of their mind. 
For it does not follow hence that works merit the remission of sins that works 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
101
regenerate hearts; that works are a propitiation; that works please without Christ 
as Propitiator; that works do not need Christ as Propitiator. James says nothing of 
these things, which, nevertheless, the adversaries shamelessly infer from the words 
of James.
133] Certain other passages concerning works are also cited against us. Luke 6:37: 
Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. Is. 58:7 [9]: Is it not to deal thy bread to the 
hungry?… Then shalt thou call, and the Lord will answer. Dan. 4:24 [27]: Break off 
thy sins, by showing mercy to the poor. Matt. 5:3: Blessed are the poor in spirit; for 
theirs is the kingdom of heaven; 134] and Matt. 5:7: Blessed are the merciful; for 
they shall obtain mercy. Even these passages would contain nothing contrary to us 
if the adversaries would not falsely attach something to them. For they contain two 
things: The one is a preaching either of the Law or of repentance, which not only 
convicts those doing wrong, but also enjoins them to do what is right; the other is 
a promise which is added. But it is not added that sins are remitted without faith, 
or that works themselves are a propitiation. 135]Moreover, in the preaching of 
the Law these two things ought always to be understood namely: First, that the 
Law cannot be observed unless we have been regenerated by faith in Christ, just as 
Christ says, John 15:5: Without Me ye can do nothing. Secondly, and though some 
external works can certainly be done, this general judgment: Without faith it is im-
possible to please God, which interprets the whole Law, must be retained; and the 
Gospel must be retained, that through Christ we have access to the Father, 136] 
Heb. 10:19; Rom. 5:2. For it is evident that we are not justified by the Law. Other-
wise, why would there be need of Christ or the Gospel, if the preaching of the Law 
alone would be sufficient? Thus in the preaching of repentance, the preaching of 
the Law, or the Word convicting of sin, is not sufficient, because the Law works 
wrath, and only accuses, only terrifies consciences, because consciences never are 
at rest, unless they hear the voice of God in which the remission of sins is clearly 
promised. Accordingly, the Gospel must be added, that for Christ’s sake sins are 
remitted, and that we obtain remission of sins by faith in Christ. If the adversaries 
exclude the Gospel of Christ from the preaching of repentance, they are judged 
aright to be blasphemers against Christ.
137] Therefore, when Isaiah 1:16-18, preaches repentance: Cease to do evil; learn to 
do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the 
widow. Come now and let us reason together, saith the Lord; though your sins be 
as scarlet they shall be white as snow, the prophet thus both exhorts to repentance, 
and adds the promise. But it would be foolish to consider in such a sentence only 
the words: Relieve the oppressed; judge the fatherless. For he says in the beginning: 
Cease to do evil, where he censures impiety of heart and requires faith. Neither 
does the prophet say that through the works: Relieve the oppressed, judge the 
The Lutheran Confessions
102
fatherless, they can merit the remission of sins ex opere operato, but he commands 
such works as are necessary in the new life. Yet, in the mean time, he means that 
remission of sins is received by faith, and accordingly the promise is added. 138] 
Thus we must understand all similar passages. Christ preaches repentance when He 
says: Forgive, and He adds the promise: And ye shall be forgiven, Luke 6:37. Nor, 
indeed does He say this, namely, that, when we forgive, by this work of ours we 
merit the remission of sins ex opere operato, as they term it, but He requires a new 
life, which certainly is necessary. Yet, in the mean time, He means that remission of 
sins is received by faith. Thus, when Isaiah says, 58:7: Deal thy bread to the hungry, 
he requires a new life. Nor does the prophet speak of this work alone, but, as the 
text indicates, of the entire repentance; 139] yet, in the mean time, he intends that 
remission of sins is received by faith. For the position is sure, and none of the gates 
of hell can overthrow it, that in the preaching of repentance the preaching of the 
Law is not sufflcient, because the Law works wrath and always accuses. But the 
preaching of the Gospel should be added, namely, that in this way remission of sins 
is granted us, if we believe that sins are remitted us for Christ’s sake. Otherwise, 
why would there be need of the Gospel, why would there be need of Christ? This 
belief ought always to be in view, in order that it may be opposed to those who, 
Christ being cast aside and the Gospel being blotted out, wickedly distort the 
Scriptures to the human opinions, that by our works we purchase remission of sins.
140] Thus also in the sermon of Daniel 4:24, faith is required. [The words of the 
prophet, which were full of faith and spirit, we must not regard as heathenish as 
those of Aristotle, or any other heathen. Aristotle also admonished Alexander that 
he should not use his power for his own wantonness, but for the improvement of 
countries and men. This was written correctly and well; concerning the office of 
king nothing better can be preached or written. But Daniel is speaking to his king, 
not only concerning his office as king, but concerning repentance, the forgiveness 
of sins, reconciliation to God, and concerning sublime, great, spiritual subjects, 
which far transcend human thoughts and works.] For Daniel did not mean that 
the king should only bestow alms [which even a hypocrite can do], but embraces 
repentance when he says: Break off [Redeem, Vulg.] thy iniquities by showing 
mercy to the poor, i.e., break off thy sins by a change of heart and works. But 
here also faith is required. And Daniel proclaims to him many things concerning 
the worship of the only God, the God of Israel, and converts the king not only to 
bestow alms, but much more to faith. For we have the excellent confession of the 
king concerning the God of Israel: There is no other God that can deliver after 
this sort, Dan. 3:29. Therefore, in the sermon of Daniel there are two parts. The 
one part is that which gives commandment concerning the new life and the works 
of the new life. The other part is, that Daniel promises to the king the remission 
of sins. [Now, where there is a promise, faith is required. For the promise cannot 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
103
be received in any other way than by the heart’s relying on such word of God, 
and not regarding its own worthiness or unworthiness. Accordingly, Daniel also 
demands faith; for thus the promise reads: There will be healing for thy offenses.] 
And this promise of the remission of sins is not a preaching of the Law, but a truly 
prophetical and evangelical voice, of which Daniel certainly meant that it should 
be received in faith. 141] For Daniel knew that the remission of sins in Christ was 
promised not only to the Israelites, but also to all nations. Otherwise he could not 
have promised to the king the remission of sins. For it is not in the power of man, 
especially amid the terrors of sin, to assert, without a sure word of God concern-
ing God’s will, that He ceases to be angry. And the words of Daniel speak in his 
own language still more clearly of repentance, and still more clearly bring out the 
promise: Redeem thy sins by righteousness and thy iniquities by favors toward the 
poor. These words teach concerning the whole of repentance. [It is as much as to 
say: Amend your life! And it is true, when we amend our lives, we become rid of 
sin.] For they direct him to become righteous, then to do good works, to defend 
the miserable against injustice, as was the duty of a king. 142] But righteousness is 
faith in the heart. Moreover, sins are redeemed by repentance, i.e., the obligation 
or guilt is removed, because God forgives those who repent, as it is written in Ezek. 
18:21-22. Nor are we to infer from this that He forgives on account of works that 
follow, on account of alms; but on account of His promise He forgives those who 
apprehend His promise. Neither do any apprehend His promise, except those who 
truly believe, and by faith overcome sin and death. These, being regenerated, ought 
to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance, just as John says, Matt. 3:8. The promise, 
therefore, was added: So, there will be healing for thy offenses, Dan. 4:24. [Daniel 
does not only demand works, but says: Redeem thy sins by righteousness. Now, ev-
erybody knows that in Scripture righteousness does not mean only external works, 
but embraces faith, as Paul says: Iustus est fide vivet, The just shall live by his faith, 
Heb. 10:38. Hence, Daniel first demands faith when he mentions righteousness and 
says: Redeem thy sins by righteousness, that is, by faith toward God, by which thou 
art made righteous. In addition to this, do good works, administer your office, do 
not be a tyrant, but see that your government be profitable to your country and 
people, preserve peace, and protect the poor against unjust force. These are prince-
ly alms.] 143] Jerome here added a particle expressing doubt, that is beside the 
matter, and in his commentaries contends much more unwisely that the remission 
of sins is uncertain. But let us remember that the Gospel gives a sure promise of the 
remission of sins. And to deny that there must be a sure promise of the remission 
of sins would completely abolish the Gospel. Let us therefore dismiss Jerome con-
cerning this passage. Although the promise is displayed even in the word redeem. 
For it signifies that the remission of sins is possible, that sins can be redeemed, i.e., 
that their obligation or guilt can be removed, or the wrath of God appeased. But 
our adversaries, overlooking the promises, everywhere, consider only the precepts, 
The Lutheran Confessions
104
and attach falsely the human opinion that remission occurs on account of works, 
although the text does not say this, but much rather requires faith. For wherever a 
promise is, there faith is required. For a promise cannot be received unless by faith. 
[The same answer must also be given in reference to the passage from the Gospel: 
Forgive, and you will be forgiven. For this is just such a doctrine of repentance. The 
first part in this passage demands amendment of life and good works, the other 
part adds the promise. Nor are we to infer from this that our forgiving merits for 
us ex opere operato remission of sin. For that is not what Christ says, but as in oth-
er sacraments Christ has attached the promise to an external sign, so He attaches 
the promise of the forgiveness of sin in this place to external good works. And as 
in the Lord’s Supper we do not obtain forgiveness of sin without faith, ex opere 
operato, so neither in this action, when we forgive. For, our forgiving is not a good 
work, except it is performed by a person whose sins have been previously forgiven 
by God in Christ. If, therefore, our forgiving is to please God, it must follow after 
the forgiveness which God extends to us. For, as a rule, Christ combines these 
two, the Law and the Gospel, both faith and good works, in order to indicate that, 
where good works do not follow, there is no faith either, that we may have external 
marks, which remind us of the Gospel and the forgiveness of sin, for our comfort, 
and that thus our faith may be exercised in many ways. In this manner we are to 
understand such passages, otherwise they would directly contradict the entire Gos-
pel, and our beggarly works would be put in the place of Christ, who alone is to be 
the propitiation, which no man is by any means to despise. Again, if these passages 
were to be understood as relating to works, the remission of sins would be quite 
uncertain; for it would rest on a poor foundation, on our miserable works.]
144] But works become conspicuous among men. Human reason naturally ad-
mires these, and because it sees only works, and does not understand or consider 
faith, it dreams accordingly that these works merit remission of sins and justify. 
This opinion of the Law inheres by nature in men’s minds; 145] neither can it be 
expelled, unless when we are divinely taught. But the mind must be recalled from 
such carnal opinions to the Word of God. We see that the Gospel and the promise 
concerning Christ have been laid before us. When, therefore, the Law is preached, 
when works are enjoined, we should not spurn the promise concerning Christ. 
But the latter must first be apprehended, in order that we may be able to produce 
good works, and our works may please God, as Christ says, John 15:5: Without 
Me ye can do nothing. Therefore, if Daniel would have used such words as these: 
“Redeem your sins by repentance,” the adversaries would take no notice of this 
passage. Now, since he has actually expressed this thought in apparently other 
words, the adversaries distort his words to the injury of the doctrine of grace and 
faith, although Daniel meant most especially to include faith. Thus, therefore, we 
reply to the words of Daniel, that, inasmuch as he is preaching repentance, he is 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
105
teaching not only of works, but also of faith, as the narrative itself in the context 
testifies. Secondly, because Daniel clearly presents the promise, he necessarily 
requires faith which believes that sins are freely remitted by God. AIthough, 
therefore, in repentance he mentions works, yet Daniel does not say that by these 
works we merit remission of sins. For Daniel speaks not only of the remission of 
the punishment; because remission of the punishment is sought for in vain, unless 
the heart first receive the remission of guilt. Besides, if the adversaries understand 
Daniel as speaking only of the remission of punishment, this passage will prove 
nothing against us, because it will thus be necessary for even them to confess that 
the remission of sin and free justification precede. Afterwards even we concede 
that the punishments by which we are chastised, are mitigated by our prayers and 
good works, and finally by our entire repentance, according to 1 Cor. 11:31: For if 
we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. And Jer. 15:19: If thou return, 
then will I bring thee again. And Zech. 1:3: Turn ye unto Me, and I will turn unto 
you. And Ps. 50:15: Call upon Me in the day of trouble.
148] Let us, therefore, in all our encomiums upon works and in the preaching 
of the Law retain this rule: that the Law is not observed without Christ. As He 
Himself has said: Without Me ye can do nothing. Likewise that: Without faith it is 
impossible to please God, Heb. 11:6. For it is very certain that the doctrine of the 
Law is not intended to remove the Gospel, and to remove Christ as Propitiator. 
And let the Pharisees, our adversaries, be cursed, who so interpret the Law as to 
ascribe the glory of Christ to works, namely, that they are a propitiation, that 
they merit the remission of sins. It follows, therefore, that works are always thus 
praised, namely, that they are pleasing on account of faith, as works do not please 
without Christ as Propitiator. By Him we have access to God, Rom. 5:2, not by 
works, without Christ as Mediator. 149] Therefore, when it is said, Matt. 19:17: If 
thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments, we must believe that without 
Christ the commandments are not kept, and without Him cannot please. Thus 
in the Decalog itself, in the First Commandment, Ex. 20:6: Showing mercy unto 
thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments, the most liberal 
promise of the Law is added. But this Law is not observed without Christ. For it 
always accuses the conscience which does not satisfy the Law, and therefore in ter-
ror, flies from the judgment and punishment of the Law. Because the Law worketh 
wrath, Rom. 4:15. Man observes the Law however, when he hears that for Christ’s 
sake God is reconciled to us, even though we cannot satisfy the Law. When, by this 
faith Christ is apprehended as Mediator, the heart finds rest, and begins to love 
God and observe the Law, and knows that now, because of Christ as Mediator, it 
is pleasing to God, even though the inchoate fulfilling of the Law 150] be far from 
perfection and be very impure. Thus we must judge also concerning the preaching 
of repentance. For although in the doctrine of repentance the scholastics have said 
The Lutheran Confessions
106
nothing at all concerning faith, yet we think that none of our adversaries is so mad 
as to deny that absolution is a voice of the Gospel. And absolution ought to be 
received by faith, in order that it may cheer the terrified conscience.
151] Therefore the doctrine of repentance, because it not only commands new 
works, but also promises the remission of sins, necessarily requires faith. For 
the remission of sins is not received unless by faith. Therefore, in those passages 
that refer to repentance, we should always understand that not only works, but 
also faith is required, as in Matt. 6:14: For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your 
heavenly Father will also forgive you. Here a work is required, and the promise 
of the remission of sins is added, which does not occur on account of the work, 
but through faith, on account of Christ. 152] Just as Scripture testifies in many 
passages: Acts 10:43: To Him give all the prophets witness that through His name, 
whosoever believeth in Him, shall receive remission of sins; and 1 John 2:12: Your 
sins are forgiven you for His name’s sake; Eph. 1:7: In whom 153] we have redemp-
tion through His blood, the forgiveness of sins. Although what need is there to 
recite testimonies? This is the very voice peculiar to the Gospel, namely, that for 
Christ’s sake, and not for the sake of our works, we obtain by faith remission of 
sins. Our adversaries endeavor to suppress this voice of the Gospel by means of 
distorted passages which contain the doctrine of the Law, or of works. For it is true 
that in the doctrine of repentance works are required, because certainly a new life 
is required. But here the adversaries wrongly add that by such works we merit the 
remission of sins, or justification. 154] And yet Christ often connects the promise 
of the remission of sins to good works, not because He means that good works are 
a propitiation, for they follow reconciliation; but for two reasons. One is, because 
good fruits must necessarily follow. Therefore He reminds us that, if good fruits do 
not follow, the repentance is hypocritical and feigned. The other reason is, because 
we have need of external signs of so great a promise, because 155] a conscience full 
of fear has need of manifold consolation. As, therefore, Baptism and the Lord’s 
Supper are signs that continually admonish, cheer, and encourage desponding 
minds to believe the more firmly that their sins are forgiven, so the same promise 
is written and portrayed in good works, in order that these works may admonish 
us to believe the more firmly. And those who produce no good works do not excite 
themselves to believe, but despise these promises. The godly on the other hand, 
embrace them, and rejoice that they have the signs and testimonies of so great a 
promise. Accordingly, they exercise themselves in these signs and testimonies. Just 
as, therefore, the Lord’s Supper does not justify us ex opere operato, without faith, 
so alms do not justify us without faith, ex opere operato.

156] So also the address of Tobias 4:11, ought to be received: Alms free from every 
sin and from death. We will not say that this is hyperbole, although it ought thus 
to be received, so as not to detract from the praise of Christ, whose prerogative 
it is to free from sin and death. But we must come back to the rule that without 
Christ the doctrine of the Law 157] is of no profit. Therefore those alms please 
God which follow reconciliation or justification, and not those which precede. 
Therefore they free from sin and death, not ex opere operato, but, as we have said 
above concerning repentance, that we ought to embrace faith and its fruits, so here 
we must say concerning alms that this entire newness of life saves [that they please 
God because they occur in believers]. Alms also are the exercises of faith, which 
receives the remission of sins and overcomes death, while it exercises itself more 
and more, and in these exercises receives strength. We grant also this, that alms 
merit many favors from God [but they cannot overcome death, hell, the devil, sins, 
and give the conscience peace (for this must occur alone through faith in Christ)], 
mitigate punishments, and that they merit our defense in the dangers of sins and 
of death, as we have said a little before concerning the entire repentance. [This is 
the simple meaning, which agrees also with other passages of Scripture. For wher-
ever in the Scriptures good works are praised, we must always understand them 
according to the rule of Paul, that the Law and works must not be elevated above 
Christ, but that Christ and faith are as far above all works as the heavens are above 
the earth.] 158]And the address of Tobias, regarded as a whole, shows that faith is 
required before alms, Tobias 4:5: Be mindful of the Lord, thy God, all thy days. And 
afterwards, Tobias 4:19: Bless the Lord, thy God, always, and desire of Him that 
thy ways be directed. This, however, belongs properly to that faith of which we 
speak, which believes that God is reconciled to it because of His mercy, and which 
wishes to be justified sanctified, and governed by God. 159] But our adversaries, 
charming men, pick out mutilated sentences, in order to deceive those who are 
unskilled. Afterwards they attach something from their own opinions. Therefore, 
entire passages are to be required, because, according to the common precept, it is 
unbecoming, before the entire Law is thoroughly examined, to judge or reply when 
any single clause of it is presented. And passages, when produced in their entirety, 
very frequently bring the interpretation with them.
160] Luke 11:41 is also cited in a mutilated form, namely: Give alms of such things 
as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you. The adversaries are very 
stupid [are deaf, and have callous ears; therefore, we must so often etc.]. For time 
and again we have said that to the preaching of the Law there should be added 
the Gospel concerning Christ, because of whom good works are pleasing, but they 
everywhere teach (without shame] that, Christ being excluded, 161] justification 
is merited by the works of the Law. When this passage is produced unmutilated, it 
will show that faith is required. Christ rebukes the Pharisees who think that they 
The Lutheran Confessions
108
are cleansed before God, i.e., that they are justified by frequent ablutions [by all 
sorts of baptismata carnis, that is, by all sorts of baths, washings, and cleansings 
of the body, of vessels, of garments]. Just as some Pope or other says of the water 
sprinkled with salt that it sanctifies and cleanses the people; and the gloss says that 
it cleanses from venial sins. Such also were the opinions of the Pharisees which 
Christ reproved, and to this feigned cleansing He opposes a double cleanness, the 
one internal, the other external. He bids them be cleansed inwardly [(which occurs 
only through faith)], and adds concerning the outward cleanness: Give alms of such 
things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you. 162] The adversaries 
do not apply aright the universal particle all things; for Christ adds this conclusion 
to both members: “All things will be clean unto you, if you will be clean within, 
and will outwardly give alms.” For He indicates that outward cleanness is to be re-
ferred to works commanded by God, and not to human traditions, such as the ab-
lutions were at that time, and the daily sprinkling of water, the vesture of monks, 
the distinctions of food, and similar acts of ostentation are now. But the adversar-
ies distort the meaning by sophistically transferring the universal particle to only 
one part: 163] “All things will be clean to those having given alms.” (As if any one 
would infer: Andrew is present; therefore all the apostles are present. Wherefore in 
the antecedent both members ought to be joined: Believe and give alms. For to this 
the entire mission, the entire office of Christ points; to this end He is come that we 
should believe in Him. Now, if both parts are combined, believing and giving alms, 
it follows rightly that all things are clean: the heart by faith, the external conver-
sation by good works. Thus we must combine the entire sermon, and not invert 
the parts, and interpret the text to mean that the heart is cleansed from sin by 
alms. Moreover, there are some who think that these words were spoken by Christ 
against the Pharisees ironically, as if He meant to say: Aye, my dear lords, rob and 
steal, and then go and give alms, and you will be promptly cleansed, so that Christ 
would in a somewhat sarcastic and mocking way puncture their pharisaical hypoc-
risy. For, although they abounded in unbelief, avarice, and every evil work, they 
still observed their purifications, gave alms, and believed that they were quite pure, 
lovely saints. This interpretation is not contrary to the text.] Yet Peter says, Acts 
15:9, that hearts are purified by faith. And when this entire passage is examined, it 
presents a meaning harmonizing with the rest of Scripture, that, if the hearts are 
cleansed, and then outwardly alms are added, i.e., all the works of love, they are 
thus entirely clean, i.e., not only within, but also without. And why is not the en-
tire discourse added to it? There are many parts of the reproof, some of which give 
commandment concerning faith, and others concerning works. Nor is it the part 
of a candid reader to pick out the commands concerning works, while the passages 
concerning faith are omitted.
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
109
164] Lastly, readers are to be admonished of this, namely, that the adversaries 
give the worst advice to godly consciences when they teach that by works the 
remission of sins is merited, because conscience, in acquiring remission through 
works, cannot be confident that the work will satisfy God. Accordingly, it is always 
tormented, and continually devises other works and other acts of worship, until 
it altogether despairs. This course is described by Paul, Rom. 4:5, where he proves 
that the promise of righteousness is not obtained because of our works, because we 
could never affirm that we had a reconciled God. For the Law always accuses. Thus 
the promise would be in vain and uncertain. He accordingly concludes that this 
promise of the remission of sins and of righteousness is received by faith, not on ac-
count of works. This is the true, simple, and genuine meaning of Paul, in which the 
greatest consolation is offered godly consciences, and the glory of Christ is shown 
forth, who certainly was given to us for this purpose, namely, that through Him we 
might have grace, righteousness, and peace.
165] Thus far we have reviewed the principal passages which the adversaries cite 
against us, in order to show that faith does not justify, and that we merit, by our 
works, remission of sins and grace. But we hope that we have shown clearly enough 
to godly consciences that these passages are not opposed to our doctrine; that 
the adversaries wickedly distort the Scriptures to their opinions; that the most of 
the passages which they cite have been garbled; that, while omitting the clearest 
passages concerning faith, they only select from the Scriptures passages concern-
ing works, and even these they distort; that everywhere they add certain human 
opinions to that which the words of Scripture say; that they teach the Law in such 
a manner as to suppress the Gospel concerning Christ. 166] For the entire doctrine 
of the adversaries is, in part, derived from human reason, and is, in part, a doctrine 
of the Law, not of the Gospel. For they teach two modes of justification, of which 
the one has been derived from reason and the other from the Law, not from the 
Gospel, or the promise concerning Christ.
167] The former mode of justification with them is, that they teach that by good 
works men merit grace both de congruo and de condigno. This mode is a doctrine 
of reason, because reason, not seeing the uncleanness of the heart, thinks that it 
pleases God if it perform good works, and for this reason other works and other 
acts of worship are constantly devised, by men in great peril, against the terrors 
of conscience. The heathen and the Israelites slew human victims, and undertook 
many other most painful works in order to appease God’s wrath. Afterwards, or-
ders of monks were devised, and these vied with each other in the severity of their 
observances against the terrors of conscience and God’s wrath. And this mode of 
justification, because it is according to reason, and is altogether occupied with out-
ward works, can be understood, and to a certain extent be rendered. And to this 
The Lutheran Confessions
110
the canonists have distorted the misunderstood Church ordinances, which were 
enacted by the Fathers for a far different purpose, namely, not that by these works 
we should seek after righteousness, but that, for the sake of mutual tranquillity 
among men, there might be a certain order in the Church. In this manner they also 
distorted the Sacraments, and most especially the Mass, through which they seek 
ex opere operato righteousness, grace, and salvation.
168] Another mode of justification is handed down by the scholastic theologians 
when they teach that we are righteous through a habit infused by God, which 
is love, and that, aided by this habit, we observe the Law of God outwardly and 
inwardly, and that this fulfilling of the Law is worthy of grace and of eternal life. 
This doctrine is plainly the doctrine of the Law. For that is true which the Law 
says: Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, etc., Deut. 6:5. Thou shalt love thy neigh-
bor, Lev. 19:18. Love is, therefore, the fulfilling of the Law.
169] But it is easy for a Christian to judge concerning both modes, because both 
modes exclude Christ, and are therefore to be rejected. In the former, which 
teaches that our works are a propitiation for sin, the impiety is manifest. The 
latter mode contains much that is injurious. It does not teach that, when we are 
born again, we avail ourselves of Christ. It does not teach that justification is the 
remission of sins. It does not teach that we attain the remission of sins before we 
love, but falsely represents that we rouse in ourselves the act of love, through which 
we merit remission of sins. Nor does it teach that by faith in Christ we overcome 
the terrors of sin and death. It falsely represents that, by their own fulfilling of 
the Law, without Christ as Propitiator, men come to God. Finally, it represents 
that this very fulfilling of the Law, without Christ as Propitiator, is righteousness 
worthy of grace and eternal life, while nevertheless scarcely a weak and feeble 
fulfilling of the Law occurs even in saints.
170] But if any one will only reflect upon it that the Gospel has not been given in 
vain to the world, and that Christ has not been promised, set forth, has not been 
born, has not suffered, has not risen again in vain, he will most readily understand 
that we are justified not from reason or from the Law. In regard to justification, 
we therefore are compelled to dissent from the adversaries. For the Gospel shows 
another mode; the Gospel compels us to avail ourselves of Christ in justification; it 
teaches that through Him we have access to God by faith; it teaches that we ought 
to set Him as Mediator and Propitiator against God’s wrath; it teaches that by 
faith in Christ the remission of sins and reconciliation are received, 171] and the 
terrors of sin and of death overcome. Thus Paul also says that righteousness is not 
of the Law, but of the promise, in which the Father has promised that He wishes to 
forgive, that for Christ’s sake He wishes to be reconciled. This promise, however, is 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
111
received by faith alone, as Paul testifies, Rom. 4:13. This faith alone receives remis-
sion of sins, justifies, and regenerates. Then love and other good fruits follow. Thus, 
therefore, we teach that man is justified, as we have above said, when conscience, 
terrified by the preaching of repentance, is cheered and believes that for Christ’s 
sake it has a reconciled God. This faith is counted for righteousness before God, 
Rom. 4:3-5. 172] And when in this manner the heart is cheered and quickened by 
faith, it receives the Holy Ghost, who renews us, so that we are able to observe the 
Law; so that we are able to love God and the Word of God, and to be submissive 
to God in afflictions; so that we are able to be chaste, to love our neighbor, etc. 
Even though these works are as yet far distant from the perfection of the Law, 
yet they please on account of faith, by which we are accounted righteous, because 
we believe that for Christ’s sake we have a reconciled God. 173] These things are 
plain and in harmony with the Gospel, and can be understood by persons of sound 
mind. And from this foundation it can easily be decided why we ascribe justifica-
tion to faith, and not to love; although love follows faith, because love is the fulfill-
ing of the Law. But Paul teaches that we are justified not from the Law, but from 
the promise which is received only by faith. For we neither come to God without 
Christ as Mediator, nor receive remission of sins for the sake of our love, but for 
the sake of Christ. 174] Likewise we are not able to love God while He is angry, 
and the Law always accuses us, always manifests to us an angry God. Therefore, by 
faith we must first apprehend the promise that for Christ’s sake the Father is rec-
onciled and forgives. 175] Afterwards we begin to observe the Law. Our eyes are to 
be cast far away from human reason, far away from Moses upon Christ, and we are 
to believe that Christ is given us, in order that for His sake we may be accounted 
righteous. In the flesh we never satisfy the Law. Thus, therefore, we are accounted 
righteous, not on account of 176] the Law, but on account of Christ, because His 
merits are granted us, if we believe on Him. If any one, therefore, has considered 
these foundations, that we are not justified by the Law, because human nature 
cannot observe the Law of God and cannot love God, but that we are justified 
from the promise, in which, for Christ’s sake, reconciliation, righteousness, and 
eternal life have been promised, he will easily understand that justification must 
necessarily be ascribed to faith, if he only will reflect upon the fact that it is not in 
vain that Christ has been promised and set forth, that He has been born and has 
suffered and been raised again; if he will reflect upon the fact that the promise of 
grace in Christ is not in vain, that it was made immediately from the beginning of 
the world, apart from and beyond the Law; if he will reflect upon the fact that the 
promise should be received by faith, as 1 John 5:10 sq. says: He that believeth not 
God hath made Him a liar, because he believeth not the record that God gave of 
His Son. And this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life 
is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son of God 
hath not life. And Christ says, John 8:36: If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, 
The Lutheran Confessions
112
ye shall be free indeed. And Paul, Rom. 5:2: By whom also we have access to God; 
and he adds: by faith. By faith in Christ, therefore, the promise of remission of sins 
and of righteousness is received. Neither are we justified before God by reason or 
by the Law.
177] These things are so plain and so manifest that we wonder that the madness 
of the adversaries is so great as to call them into doubt. The proof is manifest that, 
since we are justified before God not from the Law, but from the promise, it is 
necessary to ascribe justification to faith. What can be opposed to 178] this proof, 
unless some one wish to abolish the entire Gospel and the entire Christ? The glory 
of Christ becomes more brilliant when we teach that we avail ourselves of Him 
as Mediator and Propitiator. Godly consciences see that in this doctrine the most 
abundant consolation is offered to them, namely, that they ought to believe and 
most firmly assert that they have a reconciled Father for Christ’s sake, and not for 
the sake of our righteousness, and 179] that, nevertheless, Christ aids us, so that 
we are able to observe also the Law. Of such great blessings as these the adversar-
ies deprive the Church when they condemn, and endeavor to efface, the doctrine 
concerning the righteousness of faith. Therefore let all well-disposed minds beware 
of consenting to the godless counsels of the adversaries. In the doctrine of the ad-
versaries concerning justification no mention is made of Christ, and how we ought 
to set Him against the wrath of God, as though, indeed, we were able to overcome 
the wrath of God by love, or to love an angry God. 
180] In regard to these things, consciences are left in uncertainty. For if they are to 
think that they have a reconciled God for the reason that they love, and that they 
observe the Law, they must needs always doubt whether they have a reconciled 
God, because they either do not feel this love, as the adversaries acknowledge, or 
they certainly feel that it is very small; and much more frequently do they feel that 
they are angry at the judgment of God, who oppresses human nature with many 
terrible evils, with troubles of this life, the terrors of eternal wrath, etc. When, 
therefore, will conscience be at rest, when will it be pacified? When, in this doubt 
and in these terrors, will it love God? What else is the doctrine of the Law than a 
doctrine of despair? 181] And let any one of our adversaries come forward who 
can teach us concerning this love, how he himself loves God. They do not at all 
understand what they say; they only echo, just like the walls of a house, the little 
word “love,” without understanding it. So confused and obscure is their doctrine: 
it not only transfers the glory of Christ to human works, but also leads consciences 
either to presumption or to despair. 182] But ours, we hope, is readily understood 
by pious minds, and brings godly and salutary consolation to terrified consciences. 
For as the adversaries quibble that also many wicked men and devils believe, we 
have frequently already said that we speak of faith in Christ, i.e., of faith in the 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
113
remission of sins, of faith which truly and heartily assents to the promise of grace. 
This is not brought about without a great struggle in human hearts. And men of 
sound mind can easily judge that the faith which believes that we are cared for by 
God, and that we are forgiven and heard by Him, is a matter above nature. For of 
its own accord the human mind makes no such decision concerning God. Therefore 
this faith of which we speak is neither in the wicked nor in devils.
183] Furthermore, if any sophist cavils that righteousness is in the will, and 
therefore it cannot be ascribed to faith, which is in the intellect, the reply is easy, 
because in the schools even such persons acknowledge that the will commands the 
intellect to assent to the Word of God. We say also quite clearly: Just as the terrors 
of sin and death are not only thoughts of the intellect, but also horrible movements 
of the will fleeing God’s judgment, so faith is not only knowledge in the intellect, 
but also confidence in the will, i.e., it is to wish and to receive that which is offered 
in the promise, namely, reconciliation and remission of sins. 184] Scripture thus 
uses the term “faith,” as the following sentence of Paul testifies, Rom. 5:1: Being 
justified by faith, we have peace with God. Moreover, in this passage, to justi-
fy signifies, according to forensic usage, to acquit a guilty one and declare him 
righteous, but on account of the righteousness of another, 185] namely, of Christ, 
which righteousness of another is communicated to us by faith. Therefore, since in 
this passage our righteousness is the imputation of the righteousness of another, we 
must here speak concerning righteousness otherwise than when in philosophy or 
in a civil court we seek after the righteousness of one’s own work, which certain-
ly is in the will. Paul accordingly says, 1 Cor. 1:30: Of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, 
who of God is made unto us Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and 
Redemption. And 2 Cor. 5:21: 186] He hath made Him to be sin for us who knew 
no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him. But because the 
righteousness of Christ is given us by faith, faith is for this reason righteousness in 
us imputatively, i.e., it is that by which we are made acceptable to God on account 
of the imputation and ordinance of God, as Paul says, 187] Rom. 4:3-5: Faith is 
reckoned for righteousness. Although on account of certain captious persons we 
must say technically: Faith is truly righteousness, because it is obedience to the 
Gospel. For it is evident that obedience to the command of a superior is truly a 
species of distributive justice. And this obedience to the Gospel is reckoned for 
righteousness, so that, only on account of this, because by this we apprehend 
Christ as Propitiator, good works, or obedience to the Law, are pleasing. For we do 
not satisfy the Law, but for Christ’s sake this is forgiven us, as Paul says, Rom. 8:1: 
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. This 
faith gives God the honor, gives God 188] that which is His own, in this, that, by 
receiving the promises, it obeys Him. Just as Paul also says, Rom. 4:20: He staggered 
not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory

114
to God. 189] Thus the worship and divine service of the Gospel is to receive from 
God gifts; on the contrary, the worship of the Law is to offer and present our gifts 
to God. We can, however, offer nothing to God unless we have first been recon-
ciled and born again. This passage, too, brings the greatest consolation, as the chief 
worship of the Gospel is to wish to receive remission of sins, grace, and righteous-
ness. Of this worship Christ says, John 6:40: This is the will of Him that sent Me, 
that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may have everlasting 
life. And the Father says, Matt. 17:5: This is My beloved Son, 190] in whom I am 
well pleased, hear ye Him. The adversaries speak of obedience to the Law; they 
do not speak of obedience to the Gospel; and yet we cannot obey the Law, unless, 
through the Gospel, we have been born again, since we cannot love God, unless 
the remission of sins has been received. 191] For as long as we feel that He is angry 
with us, human nature flees from His wrath and judgment. If any one should make 
a cavil such as this: If that be faith which wishes those things that are offered in the 
promise, the habits of faith and hope seem to be confounded, because hope is that 
which expects promised things, —to this we reply that these dispositions cannot 
in reality be severed, in the manner that they are divided by idle speculations in 
the schools. For also in the Epistle to the Hebrews faith is defined as the substance 
(exspectatio) of things hoped for, Heb. 11:1. Yet if any one wish a distinction to be 
made, we say that the object of hope is properly a future event, but that faith is 
concerned with future and present things, and receives in the present the remission 
of sins offered in the promise.
192] From these statements we hope that it can be sufficiently understood, both 
what faith is, and that we are compelled to hold that by faith we are justified, 
reconciled, and regenerated, if, indeed, we wish to teach the righteousness of the 
Gospel, and not the righteousness of the Law. For those who teach that we are 
justified by love teach the righteousness of the Law, 193] and do not teach us in 
justification to avail ourselves of Christ as Mediator. These things also are manifest, 
namely, that not by love, but by faith, we overcome the terrors of sin and death, 
that we cannot oppose our love and fulfilling of the Law to the wrath of God, 
because Paul says, Rom. 5:2: By Christ we have access to God by faith. We urge 
this sentence so frequently for the sake of perspicuity. For it shows most clearly 
the state of our whole case, and, when carefully considered, can teach abundantly 
concerning the whole matter, and can console well-disposed minds. Accordingly, 
it is of advantage to have it at hand and in sight, not only that we may be able to 
oppose it to the doctrine of our adversaries, who teach that we come to God not 
by faith, but by love and merits, without Christ as Mediator; and also, at the same 
time that, 194] when in fear, we may cheer ourselves and exercise faith. This is also 
manifest, that without the aid of Christ we cannot observe the Law, as He Himself 
says, John 15:5: Without Me ye can do nothing. Accordingly, before we observe the 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
115
Law, our hearts must be born again by faith. [From the explanations which we have 
made it can easily be inferred what answer must be given to similar quotations. For 
the rule so interprets all passages that treat of good works that outside of Christ 
they are to be worthless before God, and that the heart must first have Christ, and 
believe that it is accepted with God for Christ’s sake, not because of its own works. 
The adversaries also bring forward some arguments of the schools, which are easily 
answered, if you know what faith is. Tried Christians speak of faith quite different-
ly from the sophists, for we have shown before that to believe means to rely on the 
mercy of God, that He desires to be gracious for Christ’s sake, without our merits. 
That is what it means to believe the article of the forgiveness of sin. To believe this 
does not mean to know the history only, which the devils also know. Therefore 
we can easily meet the argument of the schools when they say that the devils also 
believe, therefore faith does not justify. Aye, the devils know the history, but they 
do not believe the forgiveness of sin. 
Again, they say: To be righteous is to be obedient. Now, to perform works is cer-
tainly obedience; therefore works must justify. We should answer this as follows: 
To be righteous is a kind of obedience which God accepts as such. Now, God is not 
willing to accept our obedience in works as righteousness; for it is not an obedi-
ence of the heart, because none truly keep the Law. For this reason He has ordained 
that there should be another kind of obedience which He will accept as righteous-
ness, namely, that we are to acknowledge our disobedience, and trust that we are 
pleasing to God for Christ’s sake, not on account of our obedience. Accordingly, to 
be righteous in this case means to be pleasing to God, not on account of our own 
obedience, but from mercy for Christ’s sake. Again, to sin is to hate God; there-
fore, to love God must be righteousness. True, to love God is the righteousness of 
the Law. But nobody fulfils this Law. Therefore the Gospel teaches a new kind of 
righteousness, namely, that we are pleasing to God for Christ’s sake, although we 
have not fulfilled the Law; and yet, we are to begin to do the Law. Again, what is 
the difference between faith and hope? Answer: Hope expects future blessings and 
deliverance from tribulation; faith receives the present reconciliation, and con-
cludes in the heart, that God has forgiven my sin, and that He is now gracious to 
me. And this is a noble service of God, which serves God by giving Him the honor, 
and by esteeming His mercy and promise so sure that without merit we can receive 
and expect from Him all manner of blessings. And in this service of God the heart 
should be exercised and increase, of which the foolish sophists know nothing.]
195] Hence it can also be understood why we find fault with the doctrine of the 
adversaries concerning meritum condigni. The decision is very easy: because they 
do not make mention of faith, that we please God by faith for Christ’s sake, but 
imagine that good works, wrought by the aid of the habit of love, constitute a righ-

116
teousness worthy by itself to please God, and worthy of eternal life, and that they 
have no need of Christ as Mediator. [This can in no wise be tolerated.] 196] What 
else is this than to transfer the glory of Christ to our works, namely, that we please 
God because of our works, and not because of Christ? But this is also to rob Christ 
of the glory of being the Mediator, who is Mediator perpetually, and not merely in 
the beginning of justification. Paul also says, Gal. 2:17, that if one justified in Christ 
have need afterwards to seek righteousness elsewhere, he affirms of Christ that He 
is a minister of sin, i.e., that 197] He does not fully justify. [And this is what the 
holy, catholic, Christian Church teaches, preaches, and confesses, namely, that we 
are saved by mercy, as we have shown above from Jerome.] And most absurd is that 
which the adversaries teach, namely, that good works merit grace de condigno, as 
though indeed after the beginning of justification, if conscience is terrifled, as is 
ordinarily the case, grace must be sought through a good work, and not by faith in 
Christ.
198] Secondly, the doctrine of the adversaries leaves consciences in doubt, so 
that they never can be pacified, because the Law always accuses us, even in good 
works. For always the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, Gal. 5:17. How, therefore, will 
conscience here have peace without faith, if it believe that, not for Christ’s sake, 
but for the sake of one’s own work, it ought now to please God? What work will it 
find, upon what will it firmly rely as worthy of eternal life, if, indeed, hope ought 
to originate from merits? 199] Against these doubts Paul says, Rom. 5:1: Being jus-
tified by faith, we have peace with God; we ought to be firmly convinced that for 
Christ’s sake righteousness and eternal life are granted us. And of Abraham he says, 
Rom. 4:18: Against hope he believed in hope.
200] Thirdly, how will conscience know when, by the inclination of this habit of 
love, a work has been done of which it may affirm that it merits grace de condigno? 
But it is only to elude the Scriptures that this very distinction has been devised, 
namely, that men merit at one time de congruo and at another time de condigno, 
because, as we have above said, the intention of the one who works does not 
distinguish the kinds of merit; but hypocrites, in their security, think simply their 
works are worthy, and that for this reason they are accounted righteous. On the 
other hand, terrified consciences doubt concerning all works, and for this reason 
are continually seeking other works. For this is what it means to merit de congruo, 
namely, to doubt and, without faith, to work, until despair takes place. In a word, 
all that the adversaries teach in regard to this matter is full of errors and dangers.
201] Fourthly, the entire [the holy, catholic, Christian] Church confesses that 
eternal life is attained through mercy. For thus Augustine speaks On Grace and Free 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
117
Will, when, indeed, he is speaking of the works of the saints wrought after justi-
fication: God leads us to eternal life not by our merits, but according to His mercy. And 
Confessions, Book IX: Woe to the life of man, however much it may be worthy of praise, 
if it be judged with mercy removed. And Cyprian in his treatise on the Lord’s Prayer: Lest 
any one should flatter himself that he is innocent, and by exalting himself, should perish 
the more deeply, he is instructed and taught that he sins 202] daily, in that he is bidden 
to entreat daily for his sins. But the subject is well known, and has very many and 
very clear testimonies in Scripture, and in the Church Fathers, who all with one 
mouth declare that, even 203] though we have good works, yet in these very works 
we need mercy. Faith looking upon this mercy cheers and consoles us. Wherefore 
the adversaries teach erroneously when they so extol merits as to add nothing 
concerning this faith that apprehends mercy. For just as we have above said that 
the promise and faith stand in a reciprocal relation, and that the promise is not 
apprehended unless by faith, so we here say that the promised mercy correlatively 
requires faith, and cannot be apprehended without faith. Therefore we justly find 
fault with the doctrine concerning meritum condigni, since it teaches nothing of 
justifying faith, 204] and obscures the glory and office of Christ as Mediator. Nor 
should we be regarded as teaching anything new in this matter, since the Church 
Fathers have so clearly handed down the doctrine that even in good works we need 
mercy.
205] Scripture also often inculcates the same. In Ps. 143:2: And enter not into 
judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified. This 
passage denies absolutely, even to all saints and servants of God, the glory of 
righteousness, if God does not forgive, but judges and convicts their hearts. For 
when David boasts in other places of his righteousness, he speaks concerning his 
own cause against the persecutors of God’s Word; he does not speak of his personal 
purity; and he asks that the cause and glory of God be defended, as in Ps. 7:8: Judge 
me, O Lord, according to Thy righteousness, and according to mine integrity that 
is in me. Likewise in Ps. 130:3, he says that no one can endure God’s judgment, if 
God were to mark our sins: 206] If Thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, 
who shall stand? Job 9:28: I am afraid of all my sorrows [Vulg., opera, works]; Job 
9:30: If I wash myself with snow-water, and make my hands never so clean, yet 
Thou shalt plunge me in the ditch. Prov. 20:9: Who can 207] say, I have made my 
heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 1 John 1:8: If we say that we have no sin, we 
deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us, etc. 208] And in the Lord’s Prayer the 
saints ask for the remission of sins. Therefore even the saints have sins. Num. 14:18: 
The innocent shall not be innocent [cf. Ex. 34:7). Deut. 4:24: The Lord, thy God, is 
a consuming fire. Zechariah 2:13 also says: Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord. Is. 
40:6: All flesh is as grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field; 
the grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon 
The Lutheran Confessions
118
it, i.e., flesh and righteousness of the flesh cannot endure the judgment of God. 
209] Jonah 2:8 also says: They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy, 
i.e., all confidence is vain, except confidence in mercy; mercy delivers us; our own 
merits, our own efforts, do not. 210] Accordingly, Daniel, also prays, Dan. 9:18 
sq.: For we do not present our supplications before Thee for our righteousnesses, 
but for Thy great mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and 
do it; defer not for Thine own sake, O my God; for Thy city and Thy people are 
called by Thy name. Thus Daniel teaches us in praying to lay hold upon mercy, i.e., 
to trust in God’s mercy, and not to trust in our own 211] merits before God. We 
also wonder what our adversaries do in prayer, if, indeed; the profane men ever 
ask anything of God. If they declare that they are worthy because they have love 
and good works, and ask for grace as a debt, they pray precisely like the Pharisee 
in Luke 18:11, who says: I am not as other men are. He who thus prays for grace, 
and does not rely upon God’s mercy, treats Christ with dishonor, who, since He is 
our High Priest, intercedes 212] for us. Thus, therefore, prayer relies upon God’s 
mercy, when we believe that we are heard for the sake of Christ, the High Priest, 
as He Himself says, John 14:13: Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He 
will give it you. In My, name, He says, because without this High Priest we cannot 
approach the Father.
The following, through paragraph 213, are left out of the Readers Edition.
[All prudent men will see what follows from the opinion of the adversaries. For if 
we shall believe that Christ has merited only the prima gratia, as they call it, and 
that we afterwards merit eternal life by our works, hearts or consciences will he 
pacified neither at the hour of death, nor at any other time, nor can they ever build 
upon certain ground; they are never certain that God is gracious. Thus their doc-
trine unintermittingly leads to nothing but misery of soul and, finally, to despair. 
For God’s Law is not a matter of pleasantry; it ceaselessly accuses consciences out-
side of Christ, as Paul says, Rom. 4:15: The Law worketh wrath. Thus it will happen 
that if consciences feel the judgment of God, they have no certain comfort and will 
rush into despair.
Paul says: Whatsoever is not of faith is sin, Rom. 14:23. But those persons can do 
nothing from faith who are first to attain to this that God is gracious to them only 
when they have at length fulfilled the Law. They will always quake with doubt 
whether they have done enough good works, whether the Law has been satisfied, 
yea, they will keenly feel and understand that they are still under obligation to 
the Law. Accordingly, they will never be sure that they have a gracious God, and 
that their prayer is heard. Therefore they can never truly love God, nor expect any 
blessing from Him, nor truly worship God. What else are such hearts and con-
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
119
sciences than hell itself, since there is nothing in them but despair, fainting away, 
grumbling, discontent, and hatred of God, and yet in this hatred they invoke and 
worship God, just as Saul worshiped Him.
Here we appeal to all Christian minds and to all that are experienced in trials; they 
will be forced to confess and say that such great uncertainty, such disquietude, such 
torture and anxiety, such horrible fear and doubt follow from this teaching of the 
adversaries who imagine that we are accounted righteous before God by our own 
works or fulfilling of the Law which we perform, and point us to Queer Street by 
bidding us trust not in the rich, blessed promises of Grace, given us by Christ the 
Mediator, but in our own miserable works. Therefore, this conclusion stands like 
a rock, yea, like a wall, namely, that, although we have begun to do the Law, still 
we are accepted with God and at peace with Him, not on account of such works 
of ours, but for Christ’s sake by faith; nor does God, owe us everlasting life on 
account of these works. But just as forgiveness of sin and righteousness is imputed 
to us for Christ’s sake, not on account of our works, or the Law, so everlasting life, 
together with righteousness, is offered us, not on account of our works, or of the 
Law, but for Christ’s sake, as Christ says, John 6:40: This is the Father’s will that 
sent Me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may have 
everlasting life. Again, John 6:47: He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting 
life. Now, the adversaries should be asked at this point what advice they give to 
poor consciences in the hour of death: whether they comfort consciences by telling 
them that they will have a blessed departure, that they will be saved, and have a 
propitiated God, because of their own merits, or because of God’s grace and mercy 
for Christ’s sake. For St. Peter, St. Paul, and saints like them cannot boast that God 
owes them eternal life for their martyrdom, nor have they relied on their works, 
but on the mercy promised in Christ.
Nor would it be possible that a saint, great and high though he be, could make a 
firm stand against the accusations of the divine Law, the great might of the devil, 
the terror of death, and, finally, against despair and the anguish of hell, if he would 
not grasp the divine promises, the Gospel, as a tree or branch in the great flood, in 
the strong, violent stream, amidst the waves and billows of the anguish of death; 
if he does not cling by faith to the Word, which proclaims grace, and thus obtains 
eternal life without works, without the Law, from pure grace. For this doctrine 
alone preserves Christian consciences in afflictions and anguish of death. Of these 
things the adversaries know nothing, and talk of them like a blind man about 
color.
Here they will say: If we are to be saved by pure mercy, what difference is there be-
tween those who are saved, and those who are not saved? If merit is of no account, 
The Lutheran Confessions
120
there is no difference between the evil and the good, and it follows that both are 
saved alike. This argument has moved the scholastics to invent the meritum con-
digni; for there must be (they think) a difference between those who are saved, and 
those who are damned.
We reply, in the first place, that everlasting life is accorded to those whom God 
esteems just, and when they have been esteemed just, they are become, by that act, 
the children of God and coheirs of Christ, as Paul says, Rom. 8:30: Whom He justi-
fied, them He also glorified. Hence nobody is saved except only those who believe 
the Gospel. But as our reconciliation with God is uncertain if it is to rest on our 
works, and not on the gracious promise of God, which cannot fail, so, too, all that 
we expect by hope would be uncertain if it must be built on the foundation of our 
merits and works. For the Law of God ceaselessly accuses the conscience, and men 
feel in their hearts nothing but this voice from the fiery, flaming cloud: I am the 
Lord, thy God; this thou shalt do; that thou art obliged to do; this I require of thee. 
Deut. 5:6ff No conscience can for a moment be at rest when the Law and Moses 
assails the heart, before it apprehends Christ by faith. Nor can it truly hope for 
eternal life, unless it be pacified before. For a doubting conscience flees from God, 
despairs, and cannot hope. However, hope of eternal life must be certain. Now, in 
order that it may not be fickle, but certain, we must believe that we have eternal 
life, not by our works or merits, but from pure grace, by faith in Christ.
In secular affairs and in secular courts we meet with both, mercy and justice. 
Justice is certain by the laws and the verdict rendered; mercy is uncertain. In this 
matter that relates to God the case is different; for grace and mercy have been 
promised us by a certain word, and the Gospel is the word which commands us 
to believe that God is gracious and wishes to save us for Christ’s sake, as the text 
reads, John 3:17: God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but 
that the world through Him might be saved. He that believeth on Him is not 
condemned.
Now, whenever we speak of mercy, the meaning is to be this, that faith is required, 
and it is this faith that makes the difference between those who are saved, and 
those who are damned, between those who are worthy, and those who are unwor-
thy. For everlasting life has been promised to none but those who have been recon-
ciled by Christ. Faith, however, reconciles and justifies before God the moment we 
apprehend the promise by faith. And throughout our entire life we are to pray God 
and be diligent, to receive faith and to grow in faith. For, as stated before, faith is 
where repentance is, and it is not in those who walk after the flesh. This faith is 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
121
to grow and increase throughout our life by all manner of afflictions. Those who 
obtain faith are regenerated, so that they lead a new life and do good works.
Now, just as we say that true repentance is to endure throughout our entire life, 
we say, too, that good works and the fruits of faith must be done throughout our 
life, although our works never become so precious as to be equal to the treasure of 
Christ, or to merit eternal life, as Christ says, Luke 17:10: When ye shall have done 
all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants. And 
St. Bernard truly says: There is need that you must first believe that you cannot have for-
giveness of sin except by the grace of God; next, that thereafter you cannot have and do any 
good work, unless God grants it to you; lastly, that you cannot earn eternal life with your 
works, though it is not given you without merit. A little further on he says: Let no one 
deceive himself; for when you rightly consider the matter, you will undoubtedly find that 
you cannot meet with ten thousand him who approaches you with twenty thousand. These 
are strong sayings of St. Bernard; let them believe these if they will not believe us.
In order, then, that hearts may have a true, certain comfort and hope, we point 
them, with Paul, to the divine promise of grace in Christ, and teach that we must 
believe that God gives us eternal life, not on account of our works, but for Christ’s 
sake, as the Apostle John says in his Epistle, 1 John 5:12: He that hath the Son hath 
life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.]
213] Here belongs also the declaration of Christ, Luke 17:10: So likewise ye, when 
ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofit-
able servants. These words clearly declare that God saves by mercy and on account 
of His promise, not that it is due on account of the value 214] of our works. But at 
this point the adversaries play wonderfully with the words of Christ. In the first 
place, they make an antistrophe and turn it against us. Much more, they say, can 
it be said: “If we have believed all things, say, We are unprofitable servants.” 215] 
Then they add that works are of no profit to God, but are not without profit to us. 
See how the puerile study of sophistry delights the adversaries, and although these 
absurdities do not deserve a refutation, nevertheless we will reply to them in a few 
words. The antistrophe is defective. 216] For, in the first place, the adversaries are 
deceived in regard to the term faith; because, if it would signify that knowledge 
of the history which is also in the wicked and in devils, the adversaries would be 
correct in arguing that faith is unprofitable when they say: “When we have believed 
all things, say, We are unprofitable servants.” But we are speaking, not of the 
knowledge of the history, but of confidence in the promise and mercy of God. And 
this confidence in the promise confesses that we are unprofitable servants; yea, 
this confession that our works are unworthy is the very voice of faith, as appears in 
The Lutheran Confessions
122
this example of Daniel 9:18, which we cited a little above: We do not present Our 
supplications before Thee for our righteousnesses, etc. 217] For faith saves because 
it apprehends mercy, or the promise of grace, even though our works are unwor-
thy; and, thus understood, namely, that our works are unworthy, the antistrophe 
does not injure us: “When ye shall have believed all things, say, We are unprofitable 
servants;” for that we are saved by mercy, we teach with the entire Church. 218] 
But if they mean to argue from the similar: When you have done all things, do 
not trust in your works, so also, when you have believed all things, do not trust 
in the divine promise, there is no connection. [The inference is wrong: “Works do 
not help; therefore, faith also does not help.” We must give the uncultured men a 
homely illustration: It does not follow that because a half-farthing does not help, 
therefore a florin also does not help. Just as the florin is of much higher denomi-
nation and value than the half-farthing, so also should it be understood that faith 
is much higher and more efficacious than works. Not that faith helps because of 
its worth, but because it trusts in God’s promises and mercy. Faith is strong, not 
because of its worthiness, but because of the divine promise.] For they are very 
dissimilar, as the causes and objects of confidence in the former proposition are 
far dissimilar to those of the latter. In the former, confidence is confidence in our 
own works. In the latter, confidence is confidence in the divine promise. Christ, 
however, condemns confidence in our works; He does not condemn confidence in 
His promise. He does not wish us to despair of God’s grace and mercy. He accuses 
our works as unworthy, 219] but does not accuse the promise which freely offers 
mercy. And here Ambrose says well: Grace is to be acknowledged; but nature must 
not be disregarded. 
We must trust in the promise of grace and not 220] in our own nature. But the 
adversaries act in accordance with their custom, and distort, against faith, 221] the 
judgments which have been given on behalf of faith. [Hence, Christ in this place 
forbids men to trust in their own works; for they cannot help them. On the other 
hand, He does not forbid to trust in God’s promise. Yea, He requires such trust in 
the promise of God for the very reason that we are unprofitable servants and works 
can be of no help. Therefore, the knaves have improperly applied to our trust in 
the divine promise the words of Christ which treat of trust in our own worthiness. 
This clearly reveals and defeats their sophistry. May the Lord Christ soon put to 
shame the sophists who thus mutilate His holy Word! Amen.] We leave, however, 
these thorny points to the schools. The sophistry is plainly puerile when they in-
terpret “unprofitable servant,” as meaning that the works are unprofitable to God, 
but are profitable to us. Yet Christ speaks concerning that profit which makes God 
a debtor of grace to us, although it is out of place to discuss here concerning that 
which is profitable or unprofitable. For “unprofitable servants” means “insuffi-
cient,” because no one fears God as much, and loves God as much, and believes 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
123
God as much 222] as he ought. But let us dismiss these frigid cavils of the adver-
saries, concerning which, if at any time they are brought to the light, prudent men 
will easily decide what they should judge. They have found a flaw in words which 
are very plain and clear. But every one sees that in this passage confidence in our 
own works is condemned.
223] Let us, therefore, hold fast to this which the Church confesses, namely, that 
we are saved by mercy. And lest any one may here think: “If we are to be saved by 
mercy, hope will be uncertain, if in those who obtain salvation nothing precedes by 
which they may be distinguished from those who do not obtain it,” we must give 
him a satisfactory answer. For the scholastics, moved by this reason, seem to have 
devised the meritum condigni. 224] For this consideration can greatly exercise the 
human mind. We will therefore reply briefly. For the very reason that hope may be 
sure, for the very reason that there may be an antecedent distinction between those 
who obtain salvation, and those who do not obtain it, it is necessary firmly to hold 
that we are saved by mercy. When this is expressed thus unqualifiedly, it seems 
absurd. For in civil courts and in human judgment, that which is of right or of debt 
is certain, and mercy is uncertain. But the matter is different with respect to God’s 
judgment; for here mercy has a clear and certain promise and command from God. 
For the Gospel is properly that command which enjoins us to believe that God is 
propitious to us for Christ’s sake. For God sent not His Son into the world to con-
demn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved, John 3:17-18. 225] 
As often, therefore, as mercy is spoken, of, faith in the promise must be added; and 
this faith produces sure hope, because it relies upon the Word and command of 
God. If hope would rely upon works, then, indeed, it would be uncertain, because 
works cannot pacify 226] the conscience, as has been said above frequently. And 
this faith makes a distinction between those who obtain salvation, and those who 
do not obtain it. Faith makes the distinction between the worthy and the unwor-
thy, because eternal life has been promised to the justified; and faith justifies.
227] But here again the adversaries will cry out that there is no need of good works 
if they do not merit eternal life. These calumnies we have refuted above. Of course, 
it is necessary to do good works. We say that, eternal life has been promised to the 
justified. But those who walk according to the flesh retain neither faith nor righ-
teousness. We are for this very end justified, that, being righteous, we may begin 
to do good works and to obey God’s Law. 228] We are regenerated and receive the 
Holy Ghost for the very end that the new life may produce new 229] works, new 
dispositions, the fear and love of God, hatred of concupiscence, etc. This faith of 
which we speak arises in repentance, and ought to be established and grow in the 
midst of good works, temptations, and dangers, so that we may continually be the 
more firmly persuaded that God for Christ’s sake cares for us, forgives us, hears 
The Lutheran Confessions
124
us. This is not learned without many and great struggles. How often is conscience 
aroused, how often does it incite even to despair when it brings to view sins, either 
old or new, or the impurity of our nature! This handwriting is not blotted out 
without a great 230] struggle, in which experience testifies what a difficult matter 
faith is. And while we are cheered in the midst of the terrors and receive consola-
tion, other spiritual movements at the same time grow, the knowledge of God, fear 
of God, hope, love of God; and we are regenerated, as Paul says, Col. 3:10 and 2 Cor. 
3:18, in the knowledge of God, and, beholding the glory of the Lord, are changed 
into the same image, i.e., we receive the true knowledge of God, 231] so that we 
truly fear Him, truly trust that we are cared for, and that we are heard by Him. 
This regeneration is, as it were, the beginning of eternal life, as Paul says, Rom. 
8:10: If Christ be in you, 232] the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life 
because of righteousness. And 2 Cor. 5:2-3: We are clothed upon, if so be that, being 
clothed, we shall not be found naked. From these statements the candid reader can 
judge that we certainly require good works, since we teach that this faith arises in 
repentance, and in repentance ought continually to increase; and in these matters 
we place Christian and spiritual perfection, if repentance and faith grow together 
in repentance. This can be better understood by the godly than 233] those things 
which are taught by the adversaries concerning contemplation or perfection. Just 
as, however, justification pertains to faith, so also life eternal pertains to faith. And 
Peter says, 1 Pet. 1:9: Receiving the end, or fruit, of your faith, the salvation of your 
souls. For the adversaries confess 234] that the justified are children of God and 
coheirs of Christ. Afterwards works, because on account of faith they please God, 
merit other bodily and spiritual rewards. For there will be distinctions in the glory 
of the saints.
235] But here the adversaries reply that eternal life is called a reward, and that 
therefore it is merited de condigno by good works. We reply briefly and plainly: 
Paul, Rom. 6:23, calls eternal life a gift, because by the righteousness presented for 
Christ’s sake, we are made at the same time sons of God and coheirs of Christ, as 
John says, 3:36: He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life. And Augustine 
says, as also do very many others who follow him: God crowns His gifts in us. Else-
where indeed, Luke 6:23, it is written: Your reward is great in heaven. If these pas-
sages seem to the adversaries 236] to conflict, they themselves may explain them. 
But they are not fair judges; for they omit the word gift. They omit also the sources 
of the entire matter [the chief part, how we are justified before God, also that 
Christ remains at all times the Mediator], and they select the word reward, and 
most harshly interpret this not only against Scripture, but also against the usage 
of the language. Hence they infer that inasmuch as it is called a reward, our works, 
therefore, are such that they ought to be a price for which eternal life is due. They 
are, therefore, worthy of grace and life eternal, and do not stand in need of mercy, 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
125
or of Christ as Mediator, 237] or of faith. This logic is altogether new; we hear the 
term reward, and therefore are to infer that there is no need of Christ as Mediator, 
or of faith having access to God for Christ’s sake, and not for the sake of our works! 
Who does not see that these are anacoluthons? We do not contend concerning the 
term reward. We dispute concerning this matter, namely, whether good works are 
of themselves worthy of grace and of eternal life, or whether they please only on 
account of faith, which apprehends Christ as Mediator. 239] Our adversaries not 
only ascribe this to works, namely, that they are worthy of grace and of eternal life, 
but they also state falsely that they have superfluous merits, which they can grant 
to others, and by which they can justify others, as when monks sell the merits of 
their orders to others. These monstrosities they heap up in the manner of Chrysip-
pus, where this one word reward is heard, namely: “It is called a reward, and there-
fore we have works which are a price for which a reward is due; therefore works 
please by themselves, and not for the sake of Christ as Mediator. And since one has 
more merits than another, therefore some have superfluous merits. And those who 
merit them can bestow these merits upon others.” 240] Stop, reader; you have not 
the whole of this sorites. For certain sacraments of this donation must be added; 
the hood is placed upon the dead. [As the Barefooted monks and other orders have 
shamelessly done in placing the hoods of their orders upon dead bodies.] By such 
accumulations the blessings brought us in Christ, and the righteousness of faith 
have been obscured. [These are acute and strong arguments, all of which they can 
spin from the single word reward, whereby they obscure Christ and faith.]
241] We are not agitating an idle logomachy concerning the term reward [but this 
great, exalted, most important matter, namely, where Christian hearts are to find 
true and certain consolation; again, whether our works can give consciences rest 
and peace; again, whether we are to believe that our works are worthy of eter-
nal life, or whether that is given us for Christ’s sake. These are the real questions 
regarding these matters; if consciences are not rightly instructed concerning these, 
they can have no certain comfort. However, we have stated clearly enough that 
good works do not fulfil the Law, that we need the mercy of God, that by faith 
we are accepted with God, that good works, be they ever so precious, even if they 
were the works of St. Paul himself, cannot bring rest to the conscience. From all 
this it follows that we are to believe that we obtain eternal life through Christ by 
faith, not on account of our works, or of the Law. But what do we say of the reward 
which Scripture mentions?] If the adversaries will concede that we are accounted 
righteous by faith because of Christ, and that good works please God because 
of faith, we will not afterwards contend much concerning the term reward. We 
confess that eternal life is a reward, because it is something due on account of the 
promise, not on account of our merits. For the justification has been promised, 
which we have above shown to be properly a gift of God; and to this gift has been

126
added the promise of eternal life, according to Rom. 8:30: Whom He justified, 
them 242] He also glorified. Here belongs what Paul says, 2 Tim. 4:8: There is laid 
up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give 
me. For the crown is due the justified 243] because of the promise. And this prom-
ise saints should know, not that they may labor for their own profit, for they ought 
to labor for the glory of God; but in order that they may not despair in afflictions, 
they should know God’s will, that He desires to aid, to deliver, to protect them. 
[Just as the inheritance and all possessions of a father are given to the son, as a rich 
compensation and reward for his obedience, and yet the son receives the inheri-
tance, not on account of his merit, but because the father, for the reason that he is 
his father, wants him to have it. Therefore it is a sufficient reason why eternal life is 
called a reward, because thereby the tribulations which we suffer, and the works of 
love which we do, are compensated, although we have not deserved it. For there are 
two kinds of compensation: one, which we are obliged, the other, which we are not 
obliged, to render. E. g., when the emperor grants a servant a principality, he there-
with compensates the servant’s work; and yet the work is not worth the principal-
ity, but the servant acknowledges that he has received a gracious lien. Thus God 
does not owe us eternal life, still, when He grants it to believers for Christ’s sake, 
that is a compensation for our sufferings and works.] Although the perfect hear the 
mention of penalties and rewards in one way, and the weak hear it in another way; 
for the weak labor for the sake of their own advantage. 244] And yet the preach-
ing of rewards and punishments is necessary. In the preaching of punishments the 
wrath of God is set forth, and therefore this pertains to the preaching of repen-
tance. In the preaching of rewards, grace is set forth. And just as Scripture, in the 
mention of good works, often embraces faith, —for it wishes righteousness of the 
heart to be included with the fruits, —so sometimes it offers grace together with 
other rewards, as in Is. 58:8f, and frequently in other places in the prophets. 
245] We also confess what we have often testified, that, although justification 
and eternal life pertain to faith, nevertheless good works merit other bodily and 
spiritual rewards [which are rendered both in this life and after this life; for God 
defers most rewards until He glorifies saints after this life, because He wishes 
them in this life to be exercised in mortifying the old man] and degrees of re-
wards, according to 1 Cor. 3:8: Every man shall receive his own reward according 
to his own labor. [For the blessed will have reward, one higher than the other. This 
difference merit makes, according as it pleases God; and it is merit, because they 
do these good works whom God has adopted as children and heirs. For thus they 
have merit, which is their own and peculiar, as one child with respect to another.] 
For the righteousness of the Gospel, which has to do with the promise of grace, 
freely receives justification and quickening. But the fulfilling of the Law, which 
follows faith, has to do with the Law, in which a reward is offered and is due, not 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
127
freely, but according to our works. But those who merit this are justified before 
they do the Law. Therefore, as Paul says, Col. 1:13; Rom. 8:17, they have before been 
translated into the kingdom of God’s Son, and been made joint-heirs with Christ. 
246] But as often as mention is made of merit, the adversaries immediately transfer 
the matter from other rewards to justification, although the Gospel freely offers 
justification on account of Christ’s merits and not of our own; and the merits of 
Christ are communicated to us by faith. But works and afflictions merit, not jus-
tification, but other remunerations, as the reward is offered for the works in these 
passages: He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he which soweth 
bountifully shall reap also bountifully, 2 Cor. 9:6. Here clearly the measure of the 
reward is connected with the measure of the work. Honor thy father and thy moth-
er, that thy days may be long upon the land, Ex. 20:12. Also here the Law offers a 
reward to a certain work. 247] Although, therefore, the fulfilling of the Law merits 
a reward, for a reward properly pertains to the Law, yet we ought to be mindful of 
the Gospel, which freely offers justification for Christ’s sake. We neither observe 
the Law, nor can observe it, before we have been reconciled to God, justified, and 
regenerated. Neither would this fulfilling of the Law please God, unless we would 
be accepted on account of faith. And because men are accepted on account of faith, 
for this very reason the inchoate fulfilling of the Law pleases, and has a reward 
in this life and after this life. 248] Concerning the term reward, very many other 
remarks might here be made, derived from the nature of the Law, which, as they 
are too extensive, must be explained in another connection.
249] But the adversaries urge that it is the prerogative of good works to merit 
eternal life, because Paul says, Rom. 2:6: Who will render to every one accord-
ing to his works. Likewise Rom 2:10: Glory, honor, and peace to every man that 
worketh good. John 5:29: They that have done good [shall come forth] unto the 
resurrection of life. Matt. 25:35: I was an hungered and ye gave Me meat, etc. 250] 
In these and all similar passages in which works are praised in the Scriptures, it is 
necessary to understand not only outward works, but also the faith of the heart, 
because Scripture does not speak of hypocrisy, but of the righteousness of the 
heart with its fruits. 251] Moreover, as often as mention is made of the Law and 
of works, we must know that Christ as Mediator is not to be excluded. For He is 
the end of the Law, and He Himself says, John 15:5: Without Me ye can do nothing. 
According to this rule we have said above that all passages concerning works can 
be judged. Wherefore, when eternal life is granted to works, it is granted to those 
who have been justified, because no men except justified men, who are led by the 
Spirit of Christ, can do good works; and without faith and Christ, as Mediator, 
good works do not please, according to Heb. 11:6: Without faith it is impossible 
to please God. 252] When Paul says: He will render to every one according to his 
works, not only the outward work ought to be understood, but all righteousness

128
or unrighteousness. So: Glory to him that worketh good, i.e., to the righteous. Ye 
gave Me meat, is cited as the fruit and witness of the righteousness of the heart 
and of faith, and therefore eternal life is rendered 253] to righteousness. [There it 
must certainly be acknowledged that Christ means not only the works, but that 
He desires to have the heart, which He wishes to esteem God aright, and to believe 
correctly concerning Him, namely, that it is through mercy that it is pleasing to 
God. Therefore Christ teaches that everlasting life will be given the righteous, as 
Christ says: The righteous shall go into everlasting life.] In this way Scripture, at 
the same time with the fruits, embraces the righteousness of the heart. And it often 
names the fruits, in order that it may be better understood by the inexperienced, 
and to signify that a new life and regeneration, and not hypocrisy, are required. But 
regeneration occurs, by faith, in repentance.
254] No sane man can judge otherwise; neither do we here affect any idle subtilty, 
so as to separate the fruits from the righteousness of the heart; if the adversaries 
would only have conceded that the fruits please because of faith, and of Christ as 
Mediator, and that by themselves they are not worthy of grace and of eternal life. 
255] For in the doctrine of the adversaries we condemn this, that in such passages 
of Scripture, understood either in a philosophical or a Jewish manner, they abolish 
the righteousness of faith, and exclude Christ as Mediator. From these passages 
they infer that works merit grace, sometimes de congruo, and at other times de 
condigno, namely, when love is added; i.e., that they justify, and because they are 
righteousness they are worthy of eternal life. This error manifestly abolishes the 
righteousness, of faith, which believes that we have access to God for Christ’s sake, 
not for the sake of, our works, and that through Christ, as Priest and Mediator, 
we are led to the Father, and have a reconciled Father, 256] as has been sufficiently 
said above. And this doctrine concerning the righteousness of faith is not to be 
neglected in the Church of Christ, because without it the office of Christ cannot 
be considered, and the doctrine of justification that is left is only a doctrine of the 
Law. But we should retain the Gospel, and the doctrine concerning the promise, 
granted for Christ’s sake.
[We are here not seeking an unnecessary subtilty, but there is a great reason why 
we must have a reliable account as regards these questions. For as soon as we con-
cede to the adversaries that works merit eternal life, they spin from this concession 
the awkward teaching that we are able to keep the Law of God, that we are not in 
need of mercy, that we are righteous before God, that is, accepted with God by our 
works, not for the sake of Christ, that we can also do works of supererogations, 
namely, more than the Law requires. Thus the entire teaching concerning faith 
is suppressed. However, if there is to be and abide a Christian Church, the pure 
teaching concerning Christ, concerning the righteousness of faith, must surely be 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
129
preserved. Therefore we must fight against these great pharisaical errors, in order 
that we redeem the name of Christ and the honor of the Gospel and of Christ, and 
preserve for Christian hearts a true, permanent, certain consolation. For how is 
it possible that a heart or conscience can obtain rest, or hope for salvation, when 
in afflictions and in the anguish of death our works in the judgment and sight of 
God utterly become dust, unless it becomes certain by faith that men are saved by 
mercy, for Christ’s sake, and not for the sake of their works, their fulfilling of the 
Law? And, indeed, St. Laurentius, when placed on the gridiron, and being tortured 
for Christ’s sake, did not think that by this work he was perfectly and absolutely 
fulfilling the Law, that he was without sin, that he did not need Christ as Media-
tor and the mercy of God. He rested his case, indeed, with the prophet, who says: 
Enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be 
justified, Ps. 143:2. Nor did St. Bernard boast that his works were worthy of eternal 
life, when he says: Perdite vixi, I have led a sinful life, etc. But he boldly comforts 
himself, clings to the promise of grace, and believes that he has remission of sins 
and life eternal for Christ’s sake, just as Psalm 32:1 teaches: Blessed is he whose 
transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. And Paul says, Rom. 4:6: David 
also describeth the blessedness of the man to whom God imputeth righteousness 
without works. Paul, then, says that he is blessed to whom righteousness is imputed 
through faith in Christ, even though he have not performed any good works. That 
is the true, permanent consolation, by which hearts and consciences can be con-
firmed and encouraged, namely, that for Christ’s sake, through faith, the remission 
of sins, righteousness, and life eternal are given us. Now, if passages which treat of 
works are understood in such a manner as to comprise faith, they are not opposed 
to our doctrine. And, indeed, it is necessary always to add faith, so as not to ex-
clude Christ as Mediator. But the fulfilment of the Law follows faith; for the Holy 
Ghost is present, who renews life. Let this suffice concerning this article.]
257] We are not, therefore, on this topic contending with the adversaries concern-
ing a small matter. We are not seeking out idle subtilties when we find fault with 
them for teaching that we merit eternal life by works, while that faith is omitted 
258] which apprehends Christ as Mediator. For of this faith which believes that for 
Christ’s sake the Father is propitious to us there is not a syllable in the scholastics. 
Everywhere they hold that we are accepted and righteous because of our works, 
wrought either from reason, or certainly wrought by the inclination 259] of that 
love concerning which they speak. And yet they have certain sayings, maxims, as 
it were, 260] of the old writers, which they distort in interpreting. In the schools 
the boast is made that good works please on account of grace, and that confidence 
must be put in God’s grace. Here they interpret grace as a habit by which we love 
God, as though, indeed, the ancients meant to say that we ought to trust in our 
love, of which we certainly experience how small and how impure it is. Although 
The Lutheran Confessions
130
it is strange how they bid us trust in love, since they teach us that we are not able 
to know whether it be present. Why do they not here set forth the grace, the mercy 
of God toward us? And as often as mention is made of this, they ought to add 
faith. For the promise of God’s mercy, reconciliation, and love towards us is not 
apprehended unless by faith. With this view they would be right in saying that we 
ought to trust in grace, 261] that good works please because of grace, when faith 
apprehends grace. In the schools the boast is also made that our good works avail 
by virtue of Christ’s passion. Well said! but why add nothing concerning faith? For 
Christ is a propitiation, as Paul, Rom. 3:25, says, through faith. When timid con-
sciences are comforted by faith, and are convinced that our sins have been blotted 
out by the death of Christ, and that God has been reconciled to us on account of 
Christ’s suffering, then, indeed, the suffering of Christ profits us. If the doctrine 
concerning faith be omitted, it is said in vain that works avail by virtue of Christ’s 
passion.
262] And very many other passages they corrupt in the schools because they do 
not teach the righteousness of faith, and because they understand by faith merely 
a knowledge of the history or of dogmas, and do not understand by it that virtue 
which apprehends the promise of grace and of righteousness, and which quickens 
hearts in the terrors of sin and of death. 263] When Paul says, Rom. 10:10: With the 
heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made 
unto salvation, we think that the adversaries acknowledge here that confession 
justifies or saves, not ex opere operato, but only on account of the faith of the 
heart. And Paul thus says that confession saves, in order to show what sort of faith 
obtains eternal life; namely, that which is firm and 264] active. That faith, however, 
which does not manifest itself in confession is not firm. Thus other good works 
please on account of faith, as also the prayers of the Church ask that all things may 
be accepted for Christ’s sake. They likewise ask all things for Christ’s sake. For it 
is manifest that at the close of prayers 265] this clause is always added: Through 
Christ, our Lord. Accordingly, we conclude that we are justified before God, are 
reconciled to God and regenerated by faith, which in repentance apprehends the 
promise of grace, and truly quickens the terrified mind, and is convinced that for 
Christ’s sake God is reconciled and propitious to us. And through this faith, 1 Peter 
1:5 says, we are kept unto salvation, ready to be revealed. 
266] The knowledge of this faith is necessary to Christians, and brings the most 
abundant consolation in all afflictions, and displays to us the office of Christ, 
because those who deny that men are justified by faith, and deny that Christ is 
Mediator and Propitiator, deny the promise of grace and the Gospel. They teach 
only the doctrine either of reason or of the Law concerning justification. 267] We 
have shown the origin of this case, so far as can here be done, and have explained 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
131
the objections of the adversaries. Good men, indeed, will easily judge these things, 
if they will think, as often as a passage concerning love or works is cited, that the 
Law cannot be observed without Christ and that we cannot be justified from the 
Law, but from 268] the Gospel, that is, from the promise of the grace promised 
in Christ. And we hope that this discussion, although brief, will be profitable to 
good men for strengthening faith, and teaching and comforting conscience. For we 
know that those things which we have said are in harmony with the prophetic and 
apostolic Scriptures, with the holy Fathers, Ambrose, Augustine, and very many 
others, and with the whole Church of Christ, which certainly confesses that Christ 
is Propitiator and Justifier.
269] Nor are we immediately to judge that the Roman Church agrees with every-
thing that the Pope, or cardinals, or bishops, or some of the theologians, or monks 
approve. For it is manifest that to most of the pontiffs their own authority is of 
greater concern than the Gospel of Christ. And it has been ascertained that most 
of them are openly Epicureans. It is evident that theologians have mingled with 
Christian doctrine more of philosophy 270] than was sufficient. Nor ought their 
influence to appear so great that it will never be lawful to dissent from their dis-
putations, because at the same time many manifest errors are found among them, 
such as, that we are able from purely natural powers to love God above all things. 
This dogma, although it is manifestly false, has produced many other errors. 271] 
For the Scriptures, the holy Fathers, and the judgments of all the godly everywhere 
make reply. Therefore, even though Popes, or some theologians, and monks in the 
Church have taught us to seek remission of sins, grace, and righteousness through 
our own works, and to invent new forms of worship, which have obscured the 
office of Christ, and have made out of Christ not a Propitiator and Justifier, but 
only a Legislator, 272] nevertheless the knowledge of Christ has always remained 
with some godly persons. Scripture, moreover, has predicted that the righteousness 
of faith would be obscured in this way by human traditions and the doctrine of 
works. Just as Paul often complains (cf. Gal. 4:9; 5:7; Col. 2:8,16 sq.; 1 Tim. 4:2 sq., 
etc.) that there were even at that time those who, instead of the righteousness of 
faith, taught that men were reconciled to God and justified by their own works 
and own acts of worship, and not by faith for Christ’s sake; because men 273] 
judge by nature that God ought to be appeased by works. Nor does reason see a 
righteousness other than the righteousness of the Law, understood in a civil sense. 
Accordingly, there have always existed in the world some who have taught this 
carnal righteousness alone to the exclusion of the righteousness of faith; and such 
teachers will also always exist. 
274] The same happened among the people of Israel. The greater part of the people 
thought that they merited remission of sins by their works; they accumulated sac-
The Lutheran Confessions
132
rifices and acts of worship. On the contrary, the prophets, in condemnation of this 
opinion, taught the righteousness of faith. And the occurrences among the people 
of Israel are illustrations of those things which 275] were to occur in the Church. 
Therefore, let the multitude of the adversaries, who condemn our doctrine, not 
disturb godly minds. For their spirit can easily be judged, because in some articles 
they have condemned truth that is so clear and manifest that their godlessness ap-
pears openly. 276] For the bull of Leo X condemned a very necessary article, which 
all Christians should hold and believe, namely, that we ought to trust that we have 
been absolved not because of our contrition, but because of Christ’s word, Matt. 
16:19: 277] Whatsoever thou shalt bind, etc. And now, in this assembly, the authors 
of the Confutation have in clear words condemned this, namely, that we have 
said that faith is a part of repentance, by which we obtain remission of sins, and 
overcome the terrors of sin, and conscience is rendered pacified. Who, however, 
does not see that this article, that by faith we obtain the remission of sins, is most 
true, most certain, and especially necessary to all Christians? Who to all posterity, 
hearing that such a doctrine has been condemned, will judge that the authors of 
this condemnation had any knowledge of Christ?
278] And concerning their spirit, a conjecture, can be made from the unheard-of 
cruelty, which it is evident that they have hitherto exercised towards most good 
men. And in this assembly we have heard that a reverend father, when opinions 
concerning our Confession were expressed, said in the senate of the Empire that no 
plan seemed to him better than to make a reply written in blood to the Confession 
which we had presented written in ink. What more cruel would Phalaris say? 
Therefore some princes also have judged this expression unworthy to be spoken 
in such a meeting. Wherefore, 279] although the adversaries claim for themselves 
the name of the Church, nevertheless we know that the Church of Christ is with 
those who teach the Gospel of Christ, not with those who defend wicked opinions 
contrary to the Gospel, as the Lord says, John 10:27: My sheep hear My voice. And 
Augustine says: The question is, Where is the Church? What, therefore, are we to 
do? Are we to seek it in our own words or in the words of its Head, our Lord Jesus 
Christ? I think that we ought to seek it in the words of Him who is Truth, and who 
knows His own body best. Hence the judgments of our adversaries will not disturb 
us, since they defend human opinions contrary to the Gospel, contrary to the 
authority of the holy Fathers, who have written in the Church, and contrary to the 
testimonies of godly minds.

Articles VII and VIII: Of the Church.
1] The Seventh Article of our Confession, in which we said that the Church is the 
congregation of saints, they have condemned, and have added a long disquisition, 
that the wicked are not to be separated from the Church since John has compared 
the Church to a threshing-floor on which wheat and chaff are heaped together, 
Matt. 3:12, and Christ has compared it to a net in which 2] there are both good and 
bad fishes, Matt. 13:47. It is, verily, a true saying, namely, that there is no remedy 
against the attacks of the slanderer. Nothing can be spoken with such care that 
it can escape detraction. 3] For this reason we have added the Eighth Article, lest 
any one might think that we separate the wicked and hypocrites from the outward 
fellowship of the Church, or that we deny efficacy to Sacraments administered by 
hypocrites or wicked men. Therefore there is no need here of a long defense against 
this slander. The Eighth Article is sufficient to exculpate us. For we grant that in 
this life hypocrites and wicked men have been mingled with the Church, and that 
they are members of the Church according to the outward fellowship of the signs 
of the Church, i.e., of Word, profession, and Sacraments, especially if they have 
not been excommunicated. 4] Neither are the Sacraments without efficacy for the 
reason that they are administered by wicked men; yea, we can even be right in 
using the Sacraments administered by wicked men. For Paul also predicts, 2 Thess. 
2:4, that Antichrist will sit in the temple of God, i.e., he will rule and bear office in 
the Church. 
5] But the Church is not only the fellowship of outward objects and rites, as other 
governments, but it is originally a fellowship of faith and of the Holy Ghost in 
hearts. [The Christian Church consists not alone in fellowship of outward signs, 
but it consists especially in inward communion of eternal blessings in the heart, as 
of the Holy Ghost, of faith, of the fear and love of God]; which fellowship never-
theless has outward marks so that it can be recognized, namely, the pure doctrine 
of the Gospel, and the administration of the Sacraments in accordance with the 
Gospel of Christ. [Namely, where God’s Word is pure, and the Sacraments are 
administered in conformity with the same, there certainly is the Church, and there 
are Christians.] And this Church alone is called the body of Christ, which Christ 
renews [Christ is its Head, and] sanctifies and governs by His Spirit, as Paul testi-
fies, Eph. 1:22 sq., when he says: And gave Him to be the Head over all things to the 
Church, which is His body, 6] the fulness of Him that filleth all in all. Wherefore, 
those in whom Christ does not act [through His Spirit] are not the members of 
Christ. This, too, the adversaries acknowledge, namely, that the wicked are dead 
members of the Church. Therefore we wonder why they have found fault with 
our description [our conclusion concerning the Church] 7] which speaks of living 
members. Neither have we said anything new. Paul has defined the Church precise-
The Lutheran Confessions
134
ly in the same way, Eph. 5:25f, that it should be cleansed in order to be holy. And 
he adds the outward marks, the Word and Sacraments. For he says thus: Christ 
also loved the Church, and gave Himself for it, that He might sanctify and cleanse 
it with the washing of water by the Word, that He might present it to Himself a 
glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should 
be holy and without blemish. In the Confession we have presented this sentence al-
most in the very words. Thus also the Church is defined by the article in the Creed 
which teaches us to believe that there is a holy Catholic Church. 8] The wicked 
indeed are not a holy Church. And that which follows, namely, the communion of 
saints, seems to be added in order to explain what the Church signifies, namely, the 
congregation of saints, who have with each other the fellowship of the same Gospel 
or doctrine [who confess one Gospel, have the same knowledge of Christ] and of 
the same Holy Ghost, who renews, sanctifies, and governs their hearts.
9] And this article has been presented for a necessary reason. [The article of the 
Church Catholic or Universal, which is gathered together from every nation under 
the sun, is very comforting and highly necessary.] We see the infinite dangers which 
threaten the destruction of the Church. In the Church itself, infinite is the multi-
tude of the wicked who oppress it [despise, bitterly hate, and most violently perse-
cute the Word, as, e.g., the Turks, Mohammedans, other tyrants, heretics, etc. For 
this reason the true teaching and the Church are often so utterly suppressed and 
disappear, as if there were no Church, which has happened under the papacy; it 
often seems that the Church has completely perished]. Therefore, in order that we 
may not despair, but may know that the Church will nevertheless remain [until the 
end of the world], likewise that we may know that, however great the multitude 
of the wicked is, yet the Church [which is Christ’s bride] exists, and that Christ 
affords those gifts which He has promised to the Church, to forgive sins, to hear 
prayer, to give the Holy Ghost, this article in the Creed presents us these consola-
tions. 10] And it says Church Catholic, in order that we may not understand the 
Church to be an outward government of certain nations [that the Church is like 
any other external polity, bound to this or that land, kingdom, or nation, as the 
Pope of Rome will say], but rather men scattered throughout the whole world [here 
and there in the world, from the rising to the setting of the sun], who agree con-
cerning the Gospel, and have the same Christ, the same Holy Ghost, and the same 
Sacraments, whether they have the same 11] or different human traditions. And 
the gloss upon the Decrees says that the Church in its wide sense embraces good 
and evil; likewise, that the wicked are in the Church only in name, not in fact; but 
that the good are in the Church both in fact and in name. And to this effect there 
are many passages in the Fathers. For Jerome says: The sinner, therefore, who has 
been soiled with any blotch cannot be called a member of the Church of Christ, 
neither can he be said to be subject to Christ.
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
135
12] Although, therefore, hypocrites and wicked men are members of this true 
Church according to outward rites [titles and offices], yet when the Church is 
defined, it is necessary to define that which is the living body of Christ, and 
which is in name and in fact the Church [which is called the body of Christ, and 
has fellowship not alone in outward signs, but has gifts in the heart, namely, the 
Holy Ghost and faith]. 13] And for this there are many reasons. For it is necessary 
to understand what it is that principally makes us members, and that, living 
members, of the Church. If we will define the Church only as an outward polity 
of the good and wicked, men will not understand that the kingdom of Christ is 
righteousness of heart and the gift of the Holy Ghost [that the kingdom of Christ 
is spiritual, as nevertheless it is; that therein Christ inwardly rules, strengthens, 
and comforts hearts, and imparts the Holy Ghost and various spiritual gifts], but 
they will judge that it is only the outward observance of certain forms of worship 
and rites. 14] Likewise, what difference will there be between the people of the 
Law and the Church if the Church is an outward polity? But Paul distinguishes 
the Church from the people of the Law thus, that the Church is a spiritual people, 
i.e., that it has been distinguished from the heathen not by civil rites [not in the 
polity and civil affairs], but that it is the true people of God, regenerated by the 
Holy Ghost. Among the people of the Law, apart from the promise of Christ, also 
the carnal seed [all those who by nature were born Jews and Abraham’s seed] had 
promises concerning corporeal things, of government, etc. And because of these 
even the wicked among them were called the people of God, because God had 
separated this carnal seed from other nations by certain outward ordinances and 
promises; and yet, 15] these wicked persons did not please God. But the Gospel 
[which is preached in the Church] brings not merely the shadow of eternal things, 
but the eternal things themselves, the Holy Ghost and righteousness, by which 
we are righteous before God. [But every true Christian is even here upon earth 
partaker of eternal blessings, even of eternal comfort, of eternal life, and of the 
Holy Ghost, and of righteousness which is from God, until he will be completely 
saved in the world to come.]
16] Therefore, only those are the people, according to the Gospel, who receive this 
promise of the Spirit. Besides, the Church is the kingdom of Christ, distinguished 
from the kingdom of the devil. It is certain, however, that the wicked are in the 
power of the devil, and members of the kingdom of the devil, as Paul teaches, 
Eph. 2:2, when he says that the devil now worketh in the children of disobedience. 
And Christ says to the Pharisees, who certainly had outward fellowship with the 
Church, i.e., with the saints among the people of the Law (for they held office, 
sacrificed, and taught): Ye are of your father, the devil, John 8:44. Therefore, the 
Church, which is truly the kingdom of Christ, is properly the congregation of 
The Lutheran Confessions
136
saints. For the wicked are ruled by the devil, and are captives of the devil; they are 
not ruled by the Spirit of Christ.
17] But what need is there of words in a manifest matter? [However, the ad-
versaries contradict the plain truth.] If the Church, which is truly the kingdom 
of Christ, is distinguished from the kingdom of the devil, it follows necessarily 
that the wicked, since they are in the kingdom of the devil, are not the Church; 
although in this life, because the kingdom of Christ has not yet been revealed; they 
are mingled with the Church, and hold offices [as teachers, and other offices] in 
the Church. 18] Neither are the wicked the kingdom of Christ, for the reason that 
the revelation has not yet been made. For that is always the kingdom which He 
quickens by His Spirit, whether it be revealed or be covered by the cross; just as He 
who has now been glorified is the same Christ who was before afflicted. 19] And 
with this clearly agree the parables of Christ, who says, Matt. 13:38, that the good 
seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the Wicked 
One. The field, He says, is the world, not the Church. Thus John [Matt. 3:12: He will 
thoroughly purge His floor, and gather His wheat into the garner; but He will burn 
up the chaff] speaks concerning the whole race of the Jews, and says that it will 
come to pass that the true Church will be separated from that people. Therefore, 
this passage is more against the adversaries than in favor of them, because it shows 
that the true and spiritual people is to be separated from the carnal people. Christ 
also speaks of the outward appearance of the Church when He says, Matt. 13:47: 
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, likewise, to ten virgins; and He teaches 
that the Church has been covered by a multitude of evils, in order that this stum-
bling-block may not offend the pious; likewise, in order that we may know that the 
Word and Sacraments are efficacious even when administered by the wicked. 
And meanwhile He teaches that these godless men, although they have the fel-
lowship of outward signs, are nevertheless not the true kingdom of Christ and 
members of Christ; 20] for they are members of the kingdom of the devil. Neither, 
indeed, are we dreaming of a Platonic state, as some wickedly charge, but we say 
that this Church exists, namely, the truly believing and righteous men scattered 
throughout the whole world. [We are speaking not of an imaginary Church, which 
is to be found nowhere; but we say and know certainly that this Church, wherein 
saints live, is and abides truly upon earth; namely, that some of God’s children 
are here and there in all the world, in various kingdoms, islands, lands, and cities, 
from the rising of the sun to its setting, who have truly learned to know Christ and 
His Gospel.] And we add the marks: the pure doctrine of the Gospel [the minis-
try or the Gospel] and the Sacraments. And this Church is properly the pillar of 
the truth, 1 Tim. 3:15. For it retains the pure Gospel, and, as Paul says, 1 Cor. 3:11 
[: “Other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ”], the

137
foundation, i.e., the true knowledge of Christ and faith. Although among these 
[in the body which is built upon the true foundation, i.e., upon Christ and faith] 
there are also many weak persons, who build upon the foundation stubble that 
will perish, i.e., certain unprofitable opinions [some human thoughts and opin-
ions], which, nevertheless, because they do not overthrow the foundation, are both 
forgiven them 21] and also corrected. And the writings of the holy Fathers testify 
that sometimes even they built stubble upon the foundation, but that this did 
not overthrow their faith. But most of those errors which our adversaries defend, 
overthrow faith, as, their condemnation of the article concerning the remission 
of sins, in which we say that the remission of sins is received by faith. Likewise it 
is a manifest and pernicious error when the adversaries teach that men merit the 
remission of sins by love to God, prior to grace. [In the place of Christ they set up 
their works, orders, masses, just as the Jews, the heathen, and the Turks intend to 
be saved by their works.] For this also is to remove “the foundation,” i.e., Christ. 
Likewise, what need will there be of faith if the Sacraments justify ex opere oper-
ato, 22] without a good disposition on the part of the one using them? [without 
faith. Now, a person that does not regard faith as necessary has already lost Christ. 
Again, they set up the worship of saints, call upon them instead of Christ, the 
Mediator, etc.] But just as the Church has the promise that it will always have 
the Holy Ghost, so it has also the threatenings that there will be wicked teachers 
and wolves. But that is the Church in the proper sense which has the Holy Ghost. 
Although wolves and wicked teachers become rampant [rage and do injury] in the 
Church, yet they are not properly the kingdom of Christ. Just as Lyra also testi-
fies, when he says: The Church does not consist of men with respect to power, or 
ecclesiastical or secular dignity, because many princes and archbishops and others 
of lower rank have been found to have apostatized from the faith. Therefore, the 
Church consists of those persons in whom there is a true knowledge and confession 
of faith and truth. What else have we said in our Confession than what Lyra here 
says [in terms so clear that he could not have spoken more clearly]?
23] But the adversaries perhaps require [a new Roman definition], that the Church 
be defined thus, namely, that it is the supreme outward monarchy of the whole 
world, in which the Roman pontiff necessarily has unquestioned power, which 
no one is permitted to dispute or censure [no matter whether he uses it rightly, 
or misuses it], to frame articles of faith; to abolish, according to his pleasure, the 
Scriptures [to pervert and interpret them contrary to all divine law, contrary to 
his own decretals, contrary to all imperial rights, as often, to as great an extent, 
and whenever it pleases him; to sell indulgences and dispensations for money]; to 
appoint rites of worship and sacrifices; likewise, to frame such laws as he may wish, 
and to dispense and exempt from whatever laws he may wish, divine, canonical, 
The Lutheran Confessions
138
or civil; and that from him [as from the vicegerent of Christ] the Emperor and all 
kings receive, according to the command of Christ, the power and right to hold 
their kingdoms, from whom, since the Father has subjected all things to Him, it 
must be understood, this right was transferred to the Pope; therefore the Pope 
must necessarily be [a God on earth, the supreme Majesty,] lord of the whole 
world, of all the kingdoms of the world, of all things private and public, and must 
have absolute power in temporal and spiritual things, and both swords, the spiri-
tual and temporal. 24] Besides, this definition, not of the Church of Christ, but of 
the papal kingdom, has as its authors not only the canonists, but also Daniel 11:36ff. 
[Daniel, the prophet, represents Antichrist in this way.]
25] Now, if we would define the Church in this way [that it is such pomp, as is 
exhibited in the Pope’s rule], we would perhaps have fairer judges. For there are 
many things extant written extravagantly and wickedly concerning the power of 
the Pope of Rome, on account of which no one has ever been arraigned. We alone 
are blamed, because we proclaim the beneficence of Christ [and write and preach 
the clear word and teaching of the apostles], that by faith in Christ we obtain re-
mission of sins, and not by [hypocrisy or innumerable] rites of worship devised by 
the Pope. 26] Moreover, Christ, the prophets, and the apostles define the Church 
of Christ far otherwise than as the papal kingdom. 
27] Neither must we transfer to the Popes what belongs to the true Church, name-
ly, that they are pillars of the truth, that they do not err. For how many of them 
care for the Gospel, or judge that it [one little page, one letter of it] is worth being 
read? Many [in Italy and elsewhere] even publicly ridicule all religions, or, if they 
approve anything, they approve such things only as are in harmony with human 
reason, and regard the rest fabulous 28] and like the tragedies of the poets. Where-
fore we hold, according to the Scriptures, that the Church, properly so called, is 
the congregation of saints [of those here and there in the world], who truly believe 
the Gospel of Christ, and have the Holy Ghost. And yet we confess that in this 
life many hypocrites and wicked men, mingled with these, have the fellowship 
of outward signs, who are members of the Church according to this fellowship 
of outward signs, and accordingly bear offices in the Church [preach, administer 
the Sacraments, and bear the title and name of Christians]. Neither does the fact 
that the Sacraments are administered by the unworthy detract from their efficacy, 
because, on account of the call of the Church, they represent the person of Christ, 
and do not represent their own persons, as Christ testifies, Luke 10:16: He that 
heareth you heareth Me. [Thus even Judas was sent to preach.] When they offer the 
Word of God, when they offer the Sacraments, they offer them in the stead and 
place of Christ. Those words of Christ teach us not to be offended by the unwor-
thiness of the ministers.
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
139
29] But concerning this matter we have spoken with sufficient clearness in the 
Confession that we condemn the Donatists and Wyclifites, who thought that men 
sinned when they received the Sacraments from the unworthy in the Church. These 
things seem, for the present, to be sufficient for the defense of the description of 
the Church which we have presented. Neither do we see how, when the Church, 
properly so called, is named the body of Christ, it should be described otherwise 
than we have described it. For it is evident that the wicked belong to the kingdom 
and body of the devil, who impels and holds captive the wicked. These things are 
clearer than the light of noonday; however, if the adversaries still continue to 
pervert them, we will not hesitate to reply at greater length.
30] The adversaries condemn also the part of the Seventh Article in which we said 
that “to the unity of the Church it is sufficient to agree concerning the doctrine of 
the Gospel and the administration of the Sacraments; nor is it necessary that hu-
man traditions, rites, or ceremonies instituted by men should be alike everywhere.” 
Here they distinguish between universal and particular rites, and approve our arti-
cle if it be understood concerning particular rites; they do not receive it concern-
ing universal rites. [That is a fine, clumsy distinction!] 31] We do not sufficiently 
understand what the adversaries mean. We are speaking of true, i.e., of spiritual 
unity [we say that those are one harmonious Church who believe in one Christ; 
who have one Gospel, one Spirit, one faith, the same Sacraments; and we are speak-
ing, therefore, of spiritual unity], without which faith in the heart, or righteousness 
of heart before God, cannot exist. For this we say that similarity of human rites, 
whether universal or particular, is not necessary, because the righteousness of faith 
is not a righteousness bound to certain traditions [outward ceremonies of human 
ordinances] as the righteousness of the Law was bound to the Mosaic ceremonies, 
because this righteousness of the heart is a matter that quickens the heart. To this 
quickening, human traditions, whether they be universal or particular, contribute 
nothing; neither are they effects of the Holy Ghost, as are chastity, patience, the 
fear of God, love to one’s neighbor, and the works, of love.
32] Neither were the reasons trifling why we presented this article. For it is evident 
that many [great errors and] foolish opinions concerning traditions had crept 
into the Church. Some thought that human traditions were necessary services for 
meriting justification [that without such human ordinances Christian holiness 
and faith are of no avail before God; also that no one can be a Christian unless he 
observe such traditions, although they are nothing but an outward regulation]. 
And afterwards they disputed how it came to pass that God was worshiped with 
such variety, as though, indeed, these observances were acts of worship, and not 
rather outward and political ordinances, pertaining in no respect to righteousness 
of heart or the worship of God, which vary, according to the circumstances, for 
The Lutheran Confessions
140
certain probable reasons, sometimes in one way, and at other times in another [as 
in worldly governments one state has customs different from another]. Likewise 
some Churches have excommunicated others because of such traditions, as the 
observance of Easter, pictures, and the like. Hence the ignorant have supposed that 
faith, or the righteousness of the heart before God, cannot exist [and that no one 
can be a Christian] without these observances. For many foolish writings of the 
Summists and of others concerning this matter are extant.
33] But just as the dissimilar length of day and night does not injure the unity 
of the Church, so we believe that the true unity of the Church is not injured by 
dissimilar rites instituted by men; although it is pleasing to us that, for the sake 
of tranquillity [unity and good order], universal rites be observed, just as also in 
the churches we willingly observe the order of the Mass, the Lord’s Day, and other 
more eminent festival days. And with a very grateful mind we embrace the profit-
able and ancient ordinances, especially since they contain a discipline by which it 
is profitable to educate and train the people and those who are ignorant [the young 
people]. 34] But now we are not discussing the question whether it be of advantage 
to observe them on account of peace or bodily profit. Another matter is treated of. 
For the question at issue is, whether the observances of human traditions are acts 
of worship necessary for righteousness before God. This is the point to be judged 
in this controversy, and when this is decided, it can afterwards be judged wheth-
er to the true unity of the Church it is necessary that human traditions should 
everywhere be alike. For if human traditions be not acts of worship necessary for 
righteousness before God, it follows that also they can be righteous and be the sons 
of God who have not the traditions which have been received elsewhere. F. i., if the 
style of German clothing is not worship of God, necessary for righteousness before 
God, it follows that men can be righteous and sons of God and the Church of 
Christ, even though they use a costume that is not German, but French.
35] Paul clearly teaches this to the Colossians 2:16-17: Let no man, therefore, judge 
you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy-day, or of the new moon, or of 
the Sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. 
Likewise, 2:20-23 sqq.: If ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, 
why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances (touch not; taste 
not; handle not; which all are to perish with the using), after the commandments 
and doctrines of men? Which things have, indeed, a show of wisdom in will-
worship and humility. 36] For the meaning is: Since righteousness of the heart is a 
spiritual matter, quickening hearts, and it is evident that human traditions do not 
quicken hearts, and are not effects of the Holy Ghost, as are love to one’s neighbor, 
chastity, etc., and are not instruments through which God moves hearts to believe, 
as are the divinely given Word and Sacraments, but are usages with regard to mat-
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
141
ters that pertain in no respect to the heart, which perish with the using, we must 
not believe that they are necessary for righteousness before God. [They are nothing 
eternal; hence, they do not procure eternal life, but are an external bodily disci-
pline, which does not change the heart.] And to the same effect he says, Rom. 14:17: 
The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness 37] and peace and 
joy in the Holy Ghost. But there is no need to cite many testimonies, since they 
are everywhere obvious in the Scriptures, and in our Confession we have brought 
together very many of them, in the latter articles. And the point to be decided in 
this controversy must be repeated after a while, namely, whether human traditions 
be acts of worship necessary for righteousness before God. There we will discuss 
this matter more fully.
38] The adversaries say that universal traditions are to be observed because they are 
supposed to have been handed down by the apostles. What religious men they are! 
They wish that the rites derived from the apostles be retained; they do not wish 
the doctrine of the apostles to be retained. 39] They must judge concerning these 
rites just as the apostles themselves judge in their writings. For the apostles did 
not wish us to believe that through such rites we are justified, that such rites are 
necessary for righteousness before God. The apostles did not wish to impose such 
a burden upon consciences; they did not wish to place righteousness and sin in the 
observance of days, food, and the like. 40] Yea, Paul calls such opinions doctrines of 
devils, 1 Tim. 4:1. 
Therefore the will and advice of the apostles ought to be derived from their 
writings; it is not enough to mention their example. They observed certain days, 
not because this observance was necessary for justification, but in order that 
the people might know at what time they should assemble. They observed also 
certain other rites and orders of lessons whenever they assembled. The people [In 
the beginning of the Church the Jews who had become Christians] retained also 
from the customs of the Fathers [from their Jewish festivals and ceremonies], as is 
commonly the case, certain things which, being somewhat changed, the apostles 
adapted to the history of the Gospel, as the Passover, Pentecost, so that not only 
by teaching, but also through these examples they might hand down to posterity 
the memory 41] of the most important subjects. But if these things were handed 
down as necessary for justification, why afterwards did the bishops change many 
things in these very matters? For, if they were matters of divine right, it was not 
lawful to change them by human authority. 42] Before the Synod of Nice, some 
observed Easter at one time and others at another time. Neither did this want of 
uniformity injure faith. Afterward the plan was adopted by which our Passover 
[Easter] did not fall at the same time as that of the Jewish Passover. But the apostles 
had commanded the Churches to observe the Passover with the brethren who had 
The Lutheran Confessions
142
been converted from Judaism. Therefore, after the Synod of Nice, certain nations 
tenaciously held to the custom of observing the Jewish time. But the apostles, by 
this decree, did not wish to impose necessity upon the Churches, as the words of 
the decree testify. For it bids no one to be troubled, even though his brethren, in 
observing Easter, do not compute the time aright. The words of the decree are 
extant in Epiphanius: Do not calculate, but celebrate it whenever your brethren of 
the circumcision do; celebrate it at the same time with them, and even though they 
may have erred, let not this be a care to you. Epiphanius writes that these are the 
words of the apostles presented in a decree concerning Easter, in which the discreet 
reader can easily judge that the apostles wished to free the people from the foolish 
opinion of a fixed time, when they prohibit them from being troubled, 43] even 
though a mistake should be made in the computation. Some, moreover, in the East, 
who were called, from the author of the dogma, Audians, contended, on account 
of this decree of the apostles, that the Passover should be observed with the Jews. 
Epiphanius, in refuting them, praises the decree, and says that it contains nothing 
which deviates from the faith or rule of the Church, and blames the Audians 
because they do not understand aright the expression, and interprets it in the sense 
in which we interpret it, because the apostles did not consider it of any importance 
at what time the Passover should be observed, but because prominent brethren 
had been converted from the Jews, who observed their custom, and, for the sake 
of 44] harmony, wished the rest to follow their example. And the apostles wisely 
admonished the reader neither to remove the liberty of the Gospel, nor to impose 
necessity upon consciences, because they add that they should not be troubled even 
though there should be an error in making the computation.
45] Many things of this class can be gathered from the histories, in which it ap-
pears that a want of uniformity in human observances does not injure the unity of 
faith [separate no one from the universal Christian Church]. Although, what need 
is there of discussion? The adversaries do not at all understand what the righteous-
ness of faith is, what the kingdom of Christ is, when they judge that uniformity 
of observances in food, days, clothing, and the like, which do not have the com-
mand of God, is necessary. 46] But look at the religious men, our adversaries. For 
the unity of the Church they require uniform human observances, although they 
themselves have changed the ordinance of Christ in the use of the Supper, which 
certainly was a universal ordinance before. But if universal ordinances are so neces-
sary, why do they themselves change the ordinance of Christ’s Supper, which is not 
human, but divine? But concerning this entire controversy we shall have to speak 
at different times below.
47] The entire Eighth Article has been approved, in which we confess that 
hypocrites and wicked persons have been mingled with the Church, and that the 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
143
Sacraments are efficacious even though dispensed by wicked ministers, because 
the ministers act in the place of Christ, and do not represent their own persons, 
according to 48] Luke 10:16: He that heareth you heareth Me. Impious teachers are 
to be deserted [are not to be received or heard], because these do not act any longer 
in the place of Christ, but are antichrists. And Christ says Matt. 7:15: Beware of 
false prophets. And Paul, Gal. 1:9: If any man preach any other gospel unto you, let 
him be accursed
49] Moreover, Christ has warned us in His parables concerning the Church, that 
when offended by the private vices, whether of priests or people, we should not 
excite schisms, as the Donatists have wickedly done. 50] As to those, however, 
who have excited schisms, because they denied that priests are permitted to hold 
possessions and property, we hold that they are altogether seditious. For to hold 
property is a civil ordinance. It is lawful, however, for Christians to use civil ordi-
nances, just as they use the air, the light, food, drink. For as this order of the world 
and fixed movements of the heavenly bodies are truly God’s ordinances and these 
are preserved by God, so lawful governments are truly God’s ordinances, and are 
preserved and defended by God against the devil.
Article IX: Of Baptism.
51] The Ninth Article has been approved, in which we confess that Baptism is nec-
essary to salvation, and that children are to be baptized, and that the baptism of children 
is not in vain, but is necessary and effectual to salvation. 52] And since the Gospel is 
taught among us purely and diligently, by God’s favor we receive also from it this 
fruit, that in our Churches no Anabaptists have arisen [have not gained ground in 
our Churches], because the people have been fortified by God’s Word against the 
wicked and seditious faction of these robbers. And as we condemn quite a number 
of other errors of the Anabaptists, we condemn this also, that they dispute that the 
baptism of little children is profitable. For it is very certain that the promise of sal-
vation pertains also to little children [that the divine promises of grace and of the 
Holy Ghost belong not alone to the old, but also to children]. It does not, however, 
pertain to those who are outside of Christ’s Church, where there is neither Word 
nor Sacraments, because the kingdom of Christ exists only with the Word and 
Sacraments. Therefore it is necessary to baptize little children, that the promise 
of salvation may be applied to them, according to Christ’s command, Matt. 28:19: 
Baptize all nations. Just as here salvation is offered to all, so Baptism is offered to 
all, to men, women, children, infants. It clearly follows, therefore, that infants are 
to be baptized, because with Baptism salvation [the universal grace and treasure 
of the Gospel] is offered. 53] Secondly, it is manifest that God approves of the 
The Lutheran Confessions
144
baptism of little children. Therefore the Anabaptists, who condemn the baptism 
of little children, believe wickedly. That God, however, approves of the baptism 
of little children is shown by this, namely, that God gives the Holy Ghost to those 
thus baptized [to many who have been baptized in childhood]. For if this baptism 
would be in vain, the Holy Ghost would be given to none, none would be saved, 
and finally there would be no Church. [For there have been many holy men in the 
Church who have not been baptized otherwise.] This reason, even taken alone, 
can sufficiently establish good and godly minds against the godless and fanatical 
opinions of the Anabaptists.
Article X: Of the Holy Supper.
54] The Tenth Article has been approved, in which we confess that we believe, that 
in the Lord’s Supper the body and blood of Christ are truly and substantially present, and 
are truly tendered, with those things which are seen, bread and wine, to those who receive 
the Sacrament. This belief we constantly defend, as the subject has been careful-
ly examined and considered. For since Paul says, 1 Cor. 10:16, that the bread is the 
communion of the Lord’s body, etc., it would follow, if the Lord’s body were not truly 
present, that the bread is not a communion of the body, but only of the spirit of 
Christ. 55] And we have ascertained that not only the Roman Church affirms the 
bodily presence of Christ, but the Greek Church also both now believes, and for-
merly believed, the same. For the canon of the Mass among them testifies to this, 
in which the priest clearly prays that the bread may be changed and become the 
very body of Christ. And Vulgarius, who seems to us to be not a silly writer, says 
distinctly that bread is not a mere figure, but 56] is truly changed into flesh. And there 
is a long exposition of Cyril on John 15, in which he teaches that Christ is corpo-
really offered us in the Supper. For he says thus: Nevertheless, we do not deny that we 
are joined spiritually to Christ by true faith and sincere love. But that we have no mode 
of connection with Him, according to the flesh, this indeed we entirely deny. And this, we 
say, is altogether foreign to the divine Scriptures. For who has doubted that Christ is in this 
manner a vine, and we the branches, deriving thence life for ourselves? Hear Paul saying 1 
Cor. 10:17; Rom. 12:5; Gal. 3:28: We are all one body in Christ; although we are many, we 
are, nevertheless, one in Him; for we are, all partakers of that one bread. Does he perhaps 
think that the virtue of the mystical benediction is unknown to us? Since this is in us, 
does it not also, by the communication of Christ’s flesh, cause Christ to dwell in us bodily? 
And a little after: Whence we must consider that Christ is in us not only according to the 
habit, which we call love, 57] but also by natural participation, etc. We have cited these 
testimonies, not to undertake a discussion here concerning this subject, for His 
Imperial Majesty does not disapprove of this article, but in order that all who may 
read them may the more clearly perceive that we defend the doctrine received in 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
145
the entire Church, that in the Lord’s Supper the body and blood of Christ are truly 
and substantially present, and are truly tendered with those things which are seen, 
bread and wine. And we speak of the presence of the living Christ [living body]; for 
we know that death hath no more dominion over Him, Rom. 6:9.
Article XI: Of Confession.
58] The Eleventh Article, Of Retaining Absolution in the Church, is approved. But 
they add a correction in reference to confession, namely, that the regulation 
headed, Omnis Utriusque, be observed, and that both annual confession be made, 
and, although all sins cannot be enumerated, nevertheless diligence be employed 
in order that they be recollected, and those which can be recalled, be recounted. 
Concerning this entire article, we will speak at greater length after a while, when 
we will explain our entire opinion concerning repentance. 59] It is well known 
that we have so elucidated and extolled [that we have preached, written, and 
taught in a, manner so Christian, correct, and pure] the benefit of absolution and 
the power of the keys that many distressed consciences have derived consolation 
from our doctrine; after they heard that it is the command of God, nay, rather the 
very voice of the Gospel, that we should believe the absolution, and regard it as 
certain that the remission of sins is freely granted us for Christ’s sake; and that we 
should believe that by this faith we are truly reconciled to God [as though we heard 
a voice from heaven]. This belief has encouraged many godly minds, and, in the 
beginning, brought Luther the highest commendation from all good men, since it 
shows consciences sure and firm consolation; because previously the entire power 
of absolution [entire necessary doctrine of repentance] had been kept suppressed 
by doctrines concerning works, since the sophists and monks taught nothing of 
faith and free remission [but pointed men to their own works, from which nothing 
but despair enters alarmed consciences].
60] But with respect to the time, certainly most men in our churches use the 
Sacraments, absolution and the Lord’s Supper, frequently in a year. And those 
who teach of the worth and fruits of the Sacraments speak in such a manner as 
to invite the people to use the Sacraments frequently. For concerning this subject 
there are many things extant written by our theologians in such a manner that the 
adversaries, if they are good men, will undoubtedly approve and 61] praise them. 
Excommunication is also pronounced against the openly wicked [those who live 
in manifest vices, fornication, adultery, etc.] and the despisers of the Sacraments. 
These things are thus done both according to the Gospel and according to 62] the 
old canons. But a fixed time is not prescribed, because all are not ready in like 
manner at the same time. Yea, if all are to come at the same time, they cannot be

146
heard and instructed in order [so diligently]. And the old canons and Fathers do 
not appoint a fixed time. The canon speaks only thus: If any enter the Church and be 
found never to commune, let them be admonished that, if they do not commune, they come 
to repentance. If they commune [if they wish to be regarded as Christians], let them not be 
expelled; if they fail to do so, let them be excommunicated. Christ [Paul] says, 1 Cor. 11:29, 
that those who eat unworthily eat judgment to themselves. The pastors, according-
ly, do not compel those who are not qualified to use the Sacraments.
63] Concerning the enumeration of sins in confession, men are taught in such a 
way as not to ensnare their consciences. Although it is of advantage to accustom 
inexperienced men to enumerate some things [which worry them], in order that 
they may be the more readily taught, yet we are now discussing what is necessary 
according to divine Law. Therefore, the adversaries ought not to cite for us the reg-
ulation Omnis Utriusque, which is not unknown to us, but they ought to show from 
the divine Law that an enumeration of sins is necessary for obtaining their remis-
sion. 64] The entire Church, throughout all Europe, knows what sort of snares this 
point of the regulation, which commands that all sins be confessed, has cast upon 
consciences. Neither has the text by itself as much disadvantage as was afterwards 
added by the Summists, who collect the circumstances of the sins. What labyrinths 
were there! How great a torture for the best minds! For the licentious and pro-
fane were in no way moved by these instruments of terror. 65] Afterwards, what 
tragedies [what jealousy and hatred] did the questions concerning one’s own priest 
excite among the pastors and brethren [monks of various orders], who then were 
by no means brethren when they were warring concerning jurisdiction of confes-
sions! [For all brotherliness, all friendship, ceased, when the question was concern-
ing authority and confessor’s fees.] We, therefore, believe that, according to divine 
Law, the enumeration of sins is not necessary. This also is pleasing to Panormitanus 
and very many other learned jurisconsults. Nor do we wish to impose necessity 
upon the consciences of our people by the regulation Omnis Utriusque, of which we 
judge, just as of other human traditions, that they are not acts of worship necessary 
for justification. And this regulation commands an impossible matter, that we 
should confess all sins. It is evident, however, that most sins we neither remember 
nor understand [nor do we indeed even see the greatest sins], according to Ps. 19:13: 
Who can understand his errors?
66] If the pastors are good men, they will know how far it is of advantage to 
examine [the young and otherwise] inexperienced persons; but we do not wish 
to sanction the torture [the tyranny of consciences] of the Summists, which 
notwithstanding would have been less intolerable if they had added one word 
concerning faith, which comforts and encourages consciences. Now, concerning 
this faith, which obtains the remission of sins, there is not a syllable in so great a 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
147
mass of regulations, glosses, summaries, books of confession. Christ is nowhere 
read there. [Nobody will there read a word by which he could learn to know 
Christ, or what Christ is.] Only the lists of sins are read [to the end of gathering 
and accumulating sins; and this would be of some value if they understood those 
sins which God regards as such]. And the greater part is occupied with sins against 
human traditions, 67] and this is most vain. This doctrine has forced to despair 
many, godly minds, which were not able to find rest, because they believed that 
by divine Law an enumeration was necessary, and yet they experienced that it 
was impossible. But other faults of no less moment inhere in the doctrine of the 
adversaries concerning repentance, which we will now recount.
Article XII (V): Of Repentance.
1] In the Twelfth Article they approve of the first part, in which we set forth that 
such as have fallen after baptism may obtain remission of sins at whatever time, 
and as often as they are converted. They condemn the second part, in which we 
say that the parts of repentance are contrition and faith [a penitent, contrite heart, 
and faith, namely, that I receive the forgiveness of sins through Christ]. [Hear, 
now, what it is that the adversaries deny.] They [without shame] deny that faith is 
the second part 2] of repentance. What are we to do here, O Charles, thou most 
invincible Emperor? The very voice of the Gospel is this, that by faith we obtain 
the remission of sins. [This word is not our word, but the voice and word of Jesus 
Christ, our Savior.] This voice of the Gospel these writers of the Confutation 
condemn. We, therefore, can in no way assent to the Confutation. We cannot 
condemn the voice of the Gospel, so salutary and abounding in consolation. 
What else is the denial that by faith we obtain remission of sins than to treat the 
blood and death of Christ with scorn? 3] We therefore beseech thee, O Charles, 
most invincible Emperor, patiently and diligently to hear and examine this most 
important subject, which contains the chief topic of the Gospel, and the true 
knowledge of Christ, and the true worship of God [these great, most exalted and 
important matters which concern our own souls and consciences, yea, also the 
entire faith of Christians, the entire Gospel, the knowledge of Christ, and what 
is highest and greatest, not only in this perishable, but also in the future life: 
the everlasting welfare or perdition of us all before God]. For all good men will 
ascertain that especially on this subject we have taught things that are true, godly, 
salutary, and necessary for the whole Church of Christ [things of the greatest sig-
nificance to all pious hearts in the entire Christian Church, on which their whole 
salvation and welfare depends, and without instruction on which there can be or 
remain no ministry, no Christian Church]. They will ascertain from the writings 
of our theologians that very much light has been added to the Gospel, and many 
The Lutheran Confessions
148
pernicious errors have been corrected, by which, through the opinions of the scho-
lastics and canonists, the doctrine of repentance was previously covered.
4] Before we come to the defense of our position, we must say this first: All 
good men of all ranks, and also of the theological rank, undoubtedly confess 
that before the writings of Luther appeared, the doctrine of repentance was 
very much confused. 5] The books of the Sententiaries are extant, in which 
there are innumerable questions which no theologians were ever able to explain 
satisfactorily. The people were able neither to comprehend the sum of the matter, 
nor to see what things especially were required in repentance, where peace of 
conscience was to be sought for. 6] Let any one of the adversaries come forth and 
tell us when remission of sins takes place. O good God, what darkness there is! 
They doubt whether it is in attrition or in contrition that remission of sins occurs. 
And if it occurs on account of contrition, what need is there of absolution, what 
does the power of the keys effect, if sins have been already remitted? Here, indeed, 
they also labor much more, and wickedly detract from the power of the keys. 7] 
Some dream that by the power of the keys guilt is not remitted, but that eternal 
punishments are changed into temporal. Thus the most salutary power would be 
the ministry, not of life and the Spirit, but only of wrath and punishments. Others, 
namely, the more cautious, imagine that by the power of the keys sins are remitted 
before the Church and not before God. This also is a pernicious error. For if the 
power of the keys does not console us before God, what, then, will pacify the 
conscience? 8] Still more involved is what follows. They teach that by contrition we 
merit grace. In reference to which, if any one should ask why Saul and Judas and 
similar persons, who were dreadfully contrite, did not obtain grace, the answer was 
to be taken from faith and according to the Gospel, that Judas did not believe, that 
he did not support himself by the Gospel and promise of Christ. For faith shows 
the distinction between the contrition of Judas and of Peter. But the adversaries 
take their answer from the Law, that Judas did not love God, but feared the pun-
ishments. [Is not this teaching uncertain and improper things concerning repen-
tance?] 9] When, however, will a terrified conscience, especially in those serious, 
true, and great terrors which are described in the psalms and the prophets, and 
which those certainly taste who are truly converted, be able to decide whether it 
fears God for His own sake [out of love it fears God, as its God], or is fleeing from 
eternal punishments? [These people may not have experienced much of these anx-
ieties, because they juggle words and make distinctions according to their dreams. 
But in the heart, when the test is applied, the matter turns out quite differently, 
and the conscience cannot be set at rest with paltry syllables and words.] These 
great emotions can be distinguished in letters and terms; they are not thus sepa-
rated in fact, as these sweet sophists dream. Here we appeal to the judgments of 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
149
all good and wise men [who also desire to know the truth]. They undoubtedly will 
confess that these discussions in the writings of the adversaries are very confused 
and intricate. And nevertheless the most important subject is at stake, the chief 
topic of the Gospel, the remission of sins. This entire doctrine concerning these 
questions which we have reviewed, is, in the writings of the adversaries, full of 
errors and hypocrisy, and obscures the benefit of Christ, the power of the keys, and 
the righteousness of faith [to inexpressible injury of conscience].
11] These things occur in the first act. What when they come to confession? What 
a work there is in the endless enumeration of sins, which is nevertheless, in great 
part, devoted to those against human traditions! And in order that good minds 
may by this means be the more tortured, they falsely assert that this 12] enumera-
tion is of divine right. And while they demand this enumeration under the pretext 
of divine right, in the mean time they speak coldly concerning absolution, which is 
truly of divine right. They falsely assert that the Sacrament itself confers grace ex 
opere operato, without a good disposition on the part of the one using it; no men-
tion is made of faith apprehending the absolution and consoling the conscience. 
This is truly what is generally called ajpievnai pro; tw’n musthrivwn, departing 
before the mysteries. [Such people are called genuine Jews.]
13] The third act [of this play] remains, concerning satisfactions. But this contains the 
most confused discussions. They imagine that eternal punishments are commuted 
to the punishments of purgatory, and teach that a part of these is remitted by the 
power of the keys, and that a part is to be redeemed by means of satisfactions. 14] 
They add further that satisfactions ought to be works of supererogation, and they 
make these consist of most foolish observances, such as pilgrimages, rosaries, or 
similar observances which 15] do not have the command of God. Then, just as they 
redeem purgatory by means of satisfactions, so a scheme of redeeming satisfactions 
which was most abundant in revenue [which became quite a profitable, lucrative 
business and a grand fair] was devised. For they sell [without shame] indulgences 
which they interpret as remissions of satisfactions. And this revenue [this 
trafficking, this fair, conducted so shamelessly] is not only from the living, but is 
much more ample from the dead. Nor do they redeem the satisfactions of the dead 
only by indulgences, but also by the sacrifice of the Mass. 16] In a word, the subject 
of satisfactions is infinite. Among these scandals (for we cannot enumerate all 
things) and doctrines of devils lies buried the doctrine of the righteousness of faith 
in Christ and the benefit of Christ. Wherefore, all good men understand that the 
doctrine of the sophists and canonists concerning repentance has been censured 
for a useful and godly purpose. For the following dogmas are clearly false, and 
foreign not only to Holy Scripture, but also to the Church Fathers:-
The Lutheran Confessions
150
17] I. That from the divine covenant we merit grace by good works wrought 
without grace.
18] II. That by attrition we merit grace.
19] III. That for the blotting out of sin the mere detestation of the crime is 
sufficient.
20] IV. That on account of contrition, and not by faith in Christ, we obtain 
remission of sins.
21] V. That the power of the keys avails for the remission of sins, not before God, 
but before the Church.
22] VI. That by the power of the keys sins are not remitted before God, but 
that the power of the keys has been instituted to commute eternal to temporal 
punishments, to impose upon consciences certain satisfactions, to institute new 
acts of worship, and to obligate consciences to such satisfactions and acts of 
worship.
23] VII. That according to divine right the enumeration of offenses in confession, 
concerning which the adversaries teach, is necessary.
24] VIII. That canonical satisfactions are necessary for redeeming the punishment 
of purgatory, or they profit as a compensation for the blotting out of guilt. For 
thus uninformed persons understand it. [For, although in the schools satisfactions 
are made to apply only to the punishment, everybody thinks that remission of guilt 
is thereby merited.]
25] IX. That the reception of the sacrament of repentance ex opere operato, 
without a good disposition on the part of the one using it, i.e., without faith in 
Christ, obtains grace.
26] X. That by the power of the keys our souls are freed from purgatory through 
indulgences.
27] XI. That in the reservation of cases not only canonical punishment, but the 
guilt also, ought to be reserved in reference to one who is truly converted.
28] In order, therefore, to deliver pious consciences from these labyrinths of the 
sophists, we have ascribed to repentance [or conversion] these two parts, namely, 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
151
contrition and faith. If any one desires to add a third, namely, fruits worthy of 
repentance, i.e., a change of the entire life and character for the better [good works 
which shall and must follow conversion], 29] we will not make any opposition. 
From contrition we separate those idle and infinite discussions, as to when we 
grieve from love of God, and when from fear of punishment. [For these are nothing 
but mere words and a useless babbling of persons who have never experienced the 
state of mind of a terrified conscience.] But we say that contrition is the true terror 
of conscience, which feels that God is angry with sin, and which grieves that it has 
sinned. And this contrition takes place in this manner when sins are censured by 
the Word of God, because the sum of the preaching of the Gospel is this, namely, 
to convict of sin, and to offer for Christ’s sake the remission of sins and righteous-
ness, and the Holy Ghost, and eternal life, and that as regenerate men we should 
do good works. 30] Thus Christ comprises the sum of the Gospel when He says 
in Luke 24:47: That repentance and remission of sins should be preached in My 
name among all nations. 31] And of these terrors Scripture speaks, as Ps. 38:4. 8: 
For mine iniquities are gone over mine head, as a heavy burden they are too heavy 
for me.... I am feeble and sore broken; I have roared by reason of the disquietness 
of my heart. And Ps. 6:2. 3: Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak; O Lord, 
heal me; for my bones are vexed. My soul is also sore vexed; but Thou, O Lord, how 
long? And Is. 38:10. 13: I said in the cutting off of my days, I shalt go to the gates of 
the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years ... I reckoned till morning, that, 
as a lion, so will He break all my bones. [Again, Is 38:14: Mine eyes fail with looking 
upward; O Lord, I am oppressed.] 32] In these terrors, conscience feels the wrath 
of God against sin, which is unknown to secure men walking according to the flesh 
[as the sophists and their like]. It sees the turpitude of sin, and seriously grieves 
that it has sinned; meanwhile it also flees from the dreadful wrath of God, because 
human 33] nature, unless sustained by the Word of God, cannot endure it. Thus 
Paul says, Gal. 2:19: I through the Law am dead to the Law. 34] For the Law only 
accuses and terrifies consciences. In these terrors our adversaries say nothing of 
faith; they present only the Word, which convicts of sin. When this is taught alone, 
it is the doctrine of the Law, not of the Gospel. By these griefs and terrors, they 
say, men merit grace, provided they love God. But how will men love God in true 
terrors when they feel the terrible and inexpressible wrath of God? What else than 
despair do those teach who, in these terrors, display only the Law?
35] We therefore add as the second part of repentance, Of Faith in Christ, that in 
these terrors the Gospel concerning Christ ought to be set forth to consciences, in 
which Gospel the remission of sins is freely promised concerning Christ. Therefore, 
they ought to believe that for Christ’s sake 36] sins are freely remitted to them. 
This faith cheers, sustains, and quickens the contrite, according to Rom. 5:1: Being 
justified by faith, we have peace with God. This faith obtains the remission of sins. 
The Lutheran Confessions
152
This faith justifies before God, as the same passage testifies: Being justified by faith. 
This faith shows the distinction between the contrition of Judas and Peter, of Saul 
and of David. The contrition of Judas or Saul is of no avail, for the reason that to 
this there is not added this faith, which apprehends the remission of sins, bestowed 
as a gift for Christ’s sake. Accordingly, the contrition of David or Peter avails, 
because to it there is added faith, which apprehends the remission of sins granted 
for Christ’s sake. 37] Neither is love present before reconciliation has been made 
by faith. For without Christ the Law [God’s Law or the First Commandment] is 
not performed, according to [Eph. 2:18; 3:12 ] Rom. 5:2: By Christ we have access to 
God. And this faith grows gradually and throughout the entire life, struggles with 
sin [is tested by various temptations] in order to overcome sin and death. 38] But 
love follows faith, as we have said above. And thus filial fear can be clearly defined 
as such anxiety as has been connected with faith, i.e., where faith consoles and 
sustains the anxious heart. It is servile fear when faith does not sustain the anxious 
heart [fear without faith, where there is nothing but wrath and doubt].
39] Moreover, the power of the keys administers and presents the Gospel through 
absolution, which [proclaims peace to me and] is the true voice of the Gospel. 
Thus we also comprise absolution when we speak of faith, because faith cometh 
by hearing, as Paul says Rom. 10:17. For when the Gospel is heard, and the absolu-
tion [i.e., the promise of divine grace] is heard, the conscience is encouraged and 
receives consolation. 40] And because God truly quickens through the Word, the 
keys truly remit sins before God [here on earth sins are truly canceled in such a 
manner that they are canceled also before God in heaven] according to Luke 10:16: 
He that heareth you heareth Me. Wherefore the voice of the one absolving 41] 
must be believed not otherwise than we would believe a voice from heaven. And 
absolution [that blessed word of comfort] properly can be called a sacrament of 
repentance, as also the more learned scholastic theologians speak. 42] Meanwhile 
this faith is nourished in a manifold way in temptations, through the declarations 
of the Gospel [the hearing of sermons, reading] and the use of the Sacraments. For 
these are [seals and] signs of [the covenant and grace in] the New Testament, i.e., 
signs of [propitiation and] the remission of sins. They offer, therefore, the remis-
sion of sins, as the words of the Lord’s Supper clearly testify, Matt. 26:26. 28: This 
is My body, which is given for you. This is the cup of the New Testament, etc. Thus 
faith is conceived and strengthened through absolution, through the hearing of 
the Gospel, through the use of the Sacraments, so that it may not succumb while it 
struggles 43] with the terrors of sin and death. This method of repentance is plain 
and clear, and increases the worth of the power of the keys and of the Sacraments, 
and illumines the benefit of Christ, and teaches us to avail ourselves of Christ as 
Mediator and Propitiator.
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
153
44] But as the Confutation condemns us for having assigned these two parts to 
repentance, we must show that [not we, but] Scripture expresses these as the chief 
parts in repentance or conversion. For Christ says, Matt. 11:28: Come unto Me, 
all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Here there are two 
members. The labor and the burden signify the contrition, anxiety, and terrors of 
sin and of death. To come to Christ is to believe that sins are remitted for Christ’s 
sake; when we believe, our hearts are quickened by the Holy Ghost 45] through 
the Word of Christ. Here, therefore, there are these two chief parts, contrition and 
faith. And in Mark 1:15 Christ says: Repent ye and believe the Gospel, where in 
the first member He convicts of sins; in the latter He consoles us, and shows the 
remission of sins. For to believe the Gospel is not that general faith which devils 
also have [is not only to believe the history of the Gospel], but in the proper sense 
it is to believe that the remission of sins has been granted for Christ’s sake. For this 
is revealed in the Gospel. You see also here that the two parts are joined, contrition 
when sins are reproved, and faith, when it is said: Believe the Gospel. If any one 
should say here that Christ includes also the fruits of repentance or the entire new 
life, we shall not dissent. For this suffices us, that contrition and faith are named as 
the chief parts.
46] Paul almost everywhere, when he describes conversion or renewal, designates 
these two parts, mortification and quickening, as in Col. 2:11: In whom also ye 
are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, namely, by putting 
off the body of the sins of the flesh. And afterward, Col 2:12: Wherein also ye are 
risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God. Here are two parts. [Of 
these two parts he speaks plainly Rom. 6:2, 4, 11, that we are dead to sin, which 
takes place by contrition and its terrors, and that we should rise again with Christ, 
which takes place when by faith we again obtain consolation and life. And since 
faith is to bring consolation and peace into the conscience, according to Rom. 
5:1: Being justified by faith, we have peace, it follows that there is first terror 
and anxiety in the conscience. Thus contrition and faith go side by side.] One is 
putting off the body of sins; the other is the rising again through faith. Neither 
ought these words, mortification, quickening, putting off the body of sins, rising 
again, to be understood in a Platonic way, concerning a feigned change; 47] but 
mortification signifies true terrors, such as those of the dying, which nature could 
not sustain unless it were supported by faith. So he names that as the putting off 
of the body of sins which we ordinarily call contrition, because in these griefs the 
natural concupiscence is purged away. And quickening ought not to be understood 
as a Platonic fancy, but as consolation which truly sustains life that is escaping in 
contrition. Here, therefore, are two parts: contrition and faith. For as conscience 
cannot be pacified except by faith, therefore faith alone quickens, according to the 
declaration, Hab. 2:4; Rom. 1:17: The just shall live by faith.
The Lutheran Confessions
154
48] And then in Col. 2:14 it is said that Christ blots out the handwriting which 
through the Law is against us. Here also there are two parts, the handwriting and 
the blotting out of the handwriting. The handwriting, however, is conscience, 
convicting and condemning us. The Law, moreover, is the word which reproves and 
condemns sins. Therefore, this voice which says, I have sinned against the Lord, as 
David says, 2 Sam. 12:13, is the handwriting. And wicked and secure men do not 
seriously give forth this voice. For they do not see, they do not read the sentence of 
the Law written in the heart. In true griefs and terrors this sentence is perceived. 
Therefore the handwriting which condemns us is contrition itself. To blot out 
the handwriting is to expunge this sentence by which we declare that we shall be 
condemned, and to engrave the sentence according to which we know that we have 
been freed from this condemnation. But faith is the new sentence, which reverses 
the former sentence, and gives peace and life to the heart.
49] However, what need is there to cite many testimonies since they are 
everywhere obvious in the Scriptures? Ps. 118:18: The Lord hath chastened me sore, 
but He hath not given me over unto death. Ps. 119:28: My soul melteth for heavi-
ness; strengthen Thou me according unto Thy word. Here, in the first member, 
contrition is contained, and in the second the mode is clearly described how in 
contrition we are revived, namely, by the Word of God, which 50] offers grace. This 
sustains and quickens hearts. And 1 Sam. 2:6: The Lord killeth and maketh alive; He 
bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up. By one of these, contrition is signi-
fied; 51] by the other, faith is signified. And Is. 28:21: The Lord shall be wrath that 
He may do His work, His strange work, and bring to pass His act, His strange act. 
He calls it the strange work of the Lord when He terrifies, because to quicken and 
console is God’s own work. [Other works, as, to terrify and to kill, are not God’s 
own works, for God only quickens.] But He terrifies, he says, for this reason, name-
ly, that there may be a place for consolation and quickening, because hearts that 
are secure and do not feel the wrath of God loathe consolation. 52] In this manner 
Scripture is accustomed to join these two, the terrors and the consolation, in order 
to teach that in repentance there are these chief members, contrition, and faith 
that consoles and justifies. Neither do we see how the nature of repentance can be 
presented more clearly and simply. [We know with certainty that God thus works 
in His Christians, in the Church.)
53] For the two chief works of God in men are these, to terrify, and to justify and 
quicken those who have been terrified. Into these two works all Scripture has been 
distributed. The one part is the Law, which shows, reproves, and condemns sins. 
The other part is the Gospel, i.e., the promise of grace bestowed in Christ, and this 
promise is constantly repeated in the whole of Scripture, first having been deliv-
ered to Adam [I will put enmity, etc., Gen. 3:15, afterwards to the patriarchs; then, 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
155
still more clearly proclaimed by the prophets; lastly, preached and set forth among 
the Jews by Christ, and disseminated over the entire world by the apostles. 54] For 
all the saints were justified by faith in this promise, and not by their own attrition 
or contrition.
55] And the examples [how the saints became godly] show likewise these two 
parts. After his sin Adam is reproved and becomes terrified; this was contrition. 
Afterward God promises grace, and speaks of a future seed (the blessed seed, 
i.e., Christ), by which the kingdom of the devil, death, and sin will be destroyed; 
there He offers the remission of sins. These are the chief things. For although the 
punishment is afterwards added, yet this punishment does not merit the remission 
of sin. And concerning this kind of punishment we shall speak after a while.
56] So David is reproved by Nathan, and, terrified, he says, 2 Sam. 12:13: I have 
sinned against the Lord. This is contrition. Afterward he hears the absolution: The 
Lord also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. This voice encourages David, 
and by faith sustains, justifies, and quickens him. Here a punishment is also added, 
but this punishment does not merit the remission of sins. 57] Nor are special 
punishments always added, but in repentance these two things ought always to 
exist, namely, contrition and faith, as Luke 7:37-38. The woman, who was a sinner, 
came to Christ weeping. By these tears the contrition is recognized. Afterward 
she hears the absolution: Thy sins are forgiven; thy faith hath saved thee; go in 
peace. This is the second part of repentance, namely, faith, which 58] encourages 
and consoles her. From all these it is apparent to godly readers that we assign to 
repentance those parts which properly belong to it in conversion, or regeneration, 
and the remission of sin. Worthy fruits and punishments [likewise, patience that 
we be willing to bear the cross, and punishments, which God lays upon the old 
Adam] follow regeneration and the remission of sin. For this reason we have 
mentioned these two parts, in order that the faith which we require in repentance 
[of which the sophists and canonists have all been silent] might be the better seen. 
And what that faith is which the Gospel proclaims can be better understood when 
it is set over against contrition and mortification.
59] But as the adversaries expressly condemn our statement that men obtain 
the remission of sins by faith, we shall add a few proofs from which it will be 
understood that the remission of sins is obtained not ex opere operato because of 
contrition, but by that special faith by which an individual believes that sins are 
remitted to him. For this is the chief article concerning which we are contending 
with our adversaries, and the knowledge of which we regard especially necessary 
to all Christians. As, however, it appears that we have spoken sufficiently above 
The Lutheran Confessions
156
concerning the same subject, we shall here be briefer. For very closely related are 
the topics of the doctrine of repentance and the doctrine of justification.
60] When the adversaries speak of faith, and say that it precedes repentance, they 
understand by faith, not that which justifies, but that which, in a general way, 
believes that God exists, that punishments have been threatened to the wicked 
[that there is a hell], etc. In addition to this faith we require that each one believe 
that his sins are remitted to him. Concerning this special faith we are disputing, 
and we oppose it to the opinion which bids us trust not in the promise of Christ, 
but in the opus operatum of contrition, confession, and satisfactions, etc. This faith 
follows terrors in such a manner as to overcome them, and render the conscience 
pacified. To this faith we ascribe justification and regeneration, inasmuch as it frees 
from terrors, and brings forth in the heart not only peace and joy, but also a new 
life. We maintain [with the help of God we shall defend to eternity and against 
all the gates of hell] that this faith is truly necessary for the remission of sins, and 
accordingly place it among the parts of repentance. Nor does the Church of Christ 
believe otherwise, although our adversaries [like mad dogs] contradict us.
61] Moreover, to begin with, we ask the adversaries whether to receive absolution 
is a part of repentance, or not. But if they separate it from confession, as they 
are subtile in making the distinction, we do not see of what benefit confession is 
without absolution. If, however, they do not separate the receiving of absolution 
from confession, it is necessary for them to hold that faith is a part of repentance, 
because absolution is not received except by faith. That absolution, however, is 
not received except by faith can be proved from Paul, who teaches, Rom. 4:16, that 
the promise cannot be received except by faith. But absolution is the promise of 
the remission of sins [nothing else than the Gospel, the divine promise of God’s 
grace and favor]. 62] Therefore, it necessarily requires faith. Neither do we see how 
he who does not assent to it may be said to receive absolution. And what else is 
the refusal to assent to absolution but charging God with falsehood? If the heart 
doubts, it regards those things which God promises as uncertain and of no account. 
Accordingly, in 1 John 5:10 it is written: He that believeth not God hath made Him 
a liar, because he believeth not the record that God gave of His Son
63] Secondly, we think that the adversaries acknowledge that the remission of sins 
is either a part, or the end, or, to speak in their manner, the terminus ad quem 
of repentance. [For what does repentance help if the forgiveness of sins be not 
obtained?] Therefore that by which the remission of sins is received is correctly 
added to the parts [must certainly be the most prominent part] of repentance. It 
is very certain, however, that even though all the gates of hell contradict us, yet 
the remission of sins cannot be received except by faith alone, which believes that 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
157
sins are remitted for Christ’s sake, according to Rom. 3:25: Whom God hath set 
forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood. Likewise Rom. 5:2: By whom 
also we have access by faith unto 64] grace, etc. For a terrified conscience cannot 
set against God’s wrath our works or our love, but it is at length pacified when 
it apprehends Christ as Mediator, and believes the promises given for His sake. 
For those who dream that without faith in Christ hearts become pacified, do not 
understand what the remission of sins is, or how it came to us. 65] 1 Peter 2:6, cites 
from Is. 49:23, and 28:16: He that believeth on Him shall not be confounded. It is 
necessary, therefore, that hypocrites be confounded, who are confident that they 
receive the remission of sins because of their own works, and not because of Christ. 
Peter also says in Acts 10:43: To Him give all the prophets witness that through His 
name, whosoever believeth in Him, shall receive remission of sins. What he says, 
through His name, could not be expressed more clearly, and he adds: Whosoever 
believeth in Him. Thus, therefore, we receive the remission of sins only through 
the name of Christ, i.e., for Christ’s sake, and not for the sake of any merits and 
works of our own. And this occurs when we believe that sins are remitted to us for 
Christ’s sake.
66] Our adversaries cry out that they are the Church, that they are following 
the consensus of the Church [what the Church catholic, universal, holds]. But 
Peter also here cites in our issue the consensus of the Church: To Him give all 
the prophets witness, that through His name, whosoever believeth in Him, shall 
receive remission of sins, etc. The consensus of the prophets is assuredly to be 
judged as the consensus of the Church universal. [I verily think that if all the holy 
prophets are unanimously agreed in a declaration (since God regards even a single 
prophet as an inestimable treasure), it would also be a decree, a declaration, and 
a unanimous strong conclusion of the universal, catholic, Christian, holy Church, 
and would be justly regarded as such.] We concede neither to the Pope nor to the 
Church the power to make decrees against this consensus of the prophets. 67] 
But the bull of Leo openly condemns this article, Of the Remission of Sins, and the 
adversaries condemn it in the Confutation. From which it is apparent what sort 
of a Church we must judge that of these men to be, who not only by their decrees 
censure the doctrine that we obtain the remission of sins by faith, not on account 
of our works, but on account of Christ, but who also give the command by force 
and the sword to abolish it, and by every kind of cruelty [like bloodhounds] to put 
to death good men who thus believe.
68] But they have authors of a great name, Scotus, Gabriel, and the like, and pas-
sages of the Fathers which are cited in a mutilated form in the decrees. Certainly, if 
the testimonies are to be counted, they win. For there is a very great crowd of most 
trifling writers upon the Sententiae, who, as though they had conspired, defend 
The Lutheran Confessions
158
these figments concerning the merit of attrition and of works, and other things 
which we have above recounted. [Aye, it is true, they are all called teachers and 
authors, but by their singing you can tell what sort of birds they are. These authors 
have taught nothing but philosophy, and have known nothing of Christ and the 
work of God; their books show this plainly.] 69] But lest any one be moved by 
the multitude of citations, there is no great weight in the testimonies of the later 
writers, who did not originate their own writings, but only, by compiling from the 
writers before them, transferred these opinions from some books into others. They 
have exercised no judgment, but just like petty judges silently have approved the 
errors of their superiors, which they have not understood. Let us not, therefore, 
hesitate to oppose this utterance of Peter, which cites the consensus of the proph-
ets, 70] to ever so many legions of the Sententiaries. 
71] And to this utterance of Peter the testimony of the Holy Ghost is added. For 
the text speaks thus, Acts 10:44: While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost 
fell on all them which 72] heard the Word. Therefore, let pious consciences know 
that the command of God is this, that they believe that they are freely forgiven for 
Christ’s sake, and not for the sake of our works. And by this command of God let 
them sustain themselves against despair, and 73] against the terrors of sin and of 
death. And let them know that this belief has existed among saints from the begin-
ning of the world. [Of this the idle sophists know little; and the blessed proclama-
tion, the Gospel, which proclaims the forgiveness of sins through the blessed Seed, 
that is, Christ, has from the beginning of the world been the greatest consolation 
and treasure to all pious kings, all prophets, all believers. For they have believed in 
the same Christ in whom we believe; for from the beginning of the world no saint 
has been saved in any other way than through the faith of the same Gospel.] For 
Peter clearly cites the consensus of the prophets, and the writings of the apostles 
testify that they believe the same thing. Nor are testimonies of the Fathers wanting. 
For Bernard says the same thing in words that are in no way obscure: For it is nec-
essary first of all to believe that you cannot have remission of sins except by the indulgence 
of God, but add yet that you believe also this, namely, that through Him sins are forgiven 
thee. This is the testimony which the Holy Ghost asserts in your heart, saying: “Thy sins 
are forgiven thee.” For thus the apostle judges that man is justified freely through faith. 74] 
These words of Bernard shed a wonderful light upon our cause, because he not only 
requires that we in a general way believe that sins are remitted through mercy, but 
he bids us add special faith, by which we believe that sins are remitted even to us; 
and he teaches how we may be rendered certain concerning the remission of sins, 
namely, when our hearts are encouraged by faith, and become tranquil through the 
Holy Ghost. What more do the adversaries require? [But how now, ye adversaries? 
Is St. Bernard also a heretic?] Do they still dare deny that by faith we obtain the 
remission of sins, or that faith is a part of repentance?
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
159
75] Thirdly, the adversaries say that sin is remitted, because an attrite or contrite 
person elicits an act of love to God [if we undertake from reason to love God], 
and by this act merits to receive the remission of sins. This is nothing but to teach 
the Law, the Gospel being blotted out, and the promise concerning Christ being 
abolished. For they require only the Law and our works, because the Law demands 
love. Besides, they teach us to be confident that we obtain remission of sins because 
of contrition and love. What else is this than to put confidence in our works, not 
in the Word and promise of God concerning Christ? But if the Law be sufficient 
for obtaining the remission of sins, what need is there of the Gospel? What need is 
there of Christ if we obtain remission of sins because of our own work? 76] We, on 
the other hand, call consciences away from the Law to the Gospel, and from con-
fidence in their own works to confidence in the promise and Christ, because the 
Gospel presents to us Christ, and promises freely the remission of sins for Christ’s 
sake. In this promise it bids us trust, namely, that for Christ’s sake we are recon-
ciled to the Father, and not for the sake of our own contrition or love. For there 
is no other Mediator or Propitiator than Christ. Neither can we do the works of 
the Law unless we have first been reconciled through Christ. And if we would do 
anything, yet we must believe that not for the sake of these works, but for the sake 
of Christ, as Mediator and Propitiator, we obtain the remission of sins.
77] Yea, it is a reproach to Christ and a repeal of the Gospel to believe that we 
obtain the remission of sins on account of the Law, or otherwise than by faith in 
Christ. This method also we have discussed above in the chapter Of Justification, 
where we declared why we confess that men are justified by faith, not by love. 
78] Therefore the doctrine of the adversaries, when they teach that by their own 
contrition and love men obtain the remission of sins, and trust in this contrition 
and love, is merely the doctrine of the Law, and of that, too, as not understood 
[which they do not understand with respect to the kind of love towards God 
which it demands], just as the Jews looked upon the veiled face of Moses. For let us 
imagine that love is present, let us imagine that works are present, yet neither love 
nor works can be a propitiation for sin [or be of as much value as Christ]. And they 
cannot even be opposed to the wrath and judgment of God, according to Ps. 143:2: 
Enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be 
justified. Neither ought the honor of Christ to be transferred to our works.
79] For these reasons Paul contends that we are not justified by the Law, and he 
opposes to the Law the promise of the remission of sins, which is granted for 
Christ’s sake, and teaches that we freely receive the remission of sins for Christ’s 
sake. Paul calls us away from the Law to this promise. Upon this promise he bids us 
look [and regard the Lord Christ our treasure], which certainly will be void if we 
are justified by the Law before we are justified through the promise, or if we obtain 
The Lutheran Confessions
160
the remission of sins on account of our own righteousness. 80] But it is evident that 
the promise was given us and Christ was tendered to us for the very reason that we 
cannot do the works of the Law. Therefore it is necessary that we are reconciled by 
the promise before we do the works of the Law. The promise, however, is received 
only by faith. Therefore it is necessary for contrite persons to apprehend by faith 
the promise of the remission of sins granted for Christ’s sake, and to be confident 
that freely for Christ’s sake they have a reconciled Father. 81] This is the meaning 
of Paul, Rom. 4:16, where he says: Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace, 
to the end the promise might be sure. And Gal. 3:22: The Scripture hath concluded 
all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given them that 
believe, i.e., all are under sin, neither can they be freed otherwise than by appre-
hending by faith the promise of the remission of sins. 82] Therefore we must by 
faith accept the remission of sins before we do the works of the Law; although, 
as has been said above, love follows faith, because the regenerate receive the Holy 
Ghost, and accordingly begin [to become friendly to the Law and] to do the works 
of the Law.
83] We would cite more testimonies if they were not obvious to every godly reader 
in the Scriptures. And we do not wish to be too prolix, in order that 84] this case 
may be the more readily seen through. Neither, indeed, is there any doubt that 
the meaning of Paul is what we are defending, namely, that by faith we receive the 
remission of sins for Christ’s sake, that by faith we ought to oppose to God’s wrath 
Christ as Mediator, and not our works. Neither let godly minds be disturbed, even 
though the adversaries find fault with the judgments of Paul. Nothing is said so 
simply that it cannot be distorted by caviling. We know that what we have men-
tioned is the true and genuine meaning of Paul; we know that this our belief brings 
to godly consciences [in agony of death and temptation] sure comfort, without 
which no one can stand in God’s judgment.
85] Therefore let these pharisaic opinions of the adversaries be rejected, namely, 
that we do not receive by faith the remission of sins, but that it ought to be merit-
ed by our love and works; that we ought to oppose our love and our works to the 
wrath of God. Not of the Gospel, but of the Law is this doctrine, which feigns that 
man is justified by the Law before he has been reconciled through Christ to God, 
since Christ says, John 15:5: Without Me He can do nothing; likewise: I am the true 
Vine; ye are the branches. 86] But the adversaries feign that we are branches, not 
of Christ, but of Moses. For they wish to be justified by the Law, and to offer their 
love and works to God before they are reconciled to God through Christ, before 
they are branches of Christ. Paul, on the other hand [who is certainly a much great-
er teacher than the adversaries], contends that the Law cannot be observed without 
Christ. Accordingly, in order that we [those who truly feel and have experienced 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
161
sin and anguish of conscience must cling to the promise of grace, in order that 
they] may be reconciled to God for Christ’s sake, the promise must be received 
before we do the works of the Law. 87] We think that these things are sufficiently 
clear to godly consciences. And hence they will understand why we have declared 
above that men are justified by faith, not by love, because we must oppose to God’s 
wrath not our love or works (or trust in our love and works), but Christ as Medi-
ator [for all our ability, all our deeds and works, are far too weak to remove and 
appease God’s wrath]. And we must apprehend the promise of the remission of sins 
before we do the works of the Law.
88] Lastly, when will conscience be pacified if we receive remission of sins on the 
ground that we love, or that we do the works of the Law? For the Law will always 
accuse us, because we never satisfy God’s Law. Just as Paul says, Rom. 4:15: The Law 
worketh wrath. Chrysostom asks concerning repentance, Whence are we made 
sure that our sins are remitted us? The adversaries also, in their “Sentences,” ask 
concerning the same subject. [The question, verily, is worth asking; blessed the 
man that returns the right answer.] This cannot be explained, consciences cannot 
be made tranquil, unless they know that it is God’s command and the very Gospel 
that they should be firmly confident that for Christ’s sake sins are remitted freely, 
and that they should not doubt that these are remitted to them. If any one doubts, 
he charges, as 1 John 5:10 says, the divine promise with falsehood. We teach that 
this certainty of faith is required in the Gospel. The adversaries leave consciences 
uncertain and wavering. 89] Consciences, however, do nothing from faith when 
they perpetually doubt whether they have remission. [For it is not possible that 
there should be rest, or a quiet and peaceful conscience, if they doubt whether God 
be gracious. For if they doubt whether they have a gracious God, whether they are 
doing right, whether they have forgiveness of sins, how can, etc.] How can they 
in this doubt call upon God, how can they be confident that they are heard? Thus 
the entire life is without God [faith] and without the true worship of God. This 
is what Paul says, Rom. 14:23: Whatsoever is not of faith is sin. And because they 
are constantly occupied with this doubt, they never experience what faith [God or 
Christ] is. Thus it comes to pass that they rush at last into despair [die in doubt, 
without God, without all knowledge of God]. Such is the doctrine of the adversar-
ies, the doctrine of the Law, the annulling of the Gospel, the doctrine of despair. 
[Whereby Christ is suppressed, men are led into overwhelming sorrow and torture 
of conscience, and finally, when temptation comes, into despair. Let His Imperial 
Majesty graciously consider and well examine this matter; it does not concern 
gold or silver, but souls and consciences.] Now 90] we are glad to refer to all good 
men the judgment concerning this topic of repentance (for it has no obscurity), in 
order that they may decide whether we or the adversaries have taught those things 
which are more godly and healthful to consciences. Indeed, these dissensions in the 
The Lutheran Confessions
162
Church do not delight us; wherefore, if we did not have great and necessary reasons 
for dissenting from the adversaries we would with the greatest pleasure be silent. 
But now, since they condemn the manifest truth, it is not right for us to desert 
a cause which is not our own, but is that of Christ and the Church. [We cannot 
with fidelity to God and conscience deny this blessed doctrine and divine truth, 
from which we expect at last, when this poor temporal life ceases and all help of 
creatures fails, the only eternal, highest consolation: nor will we in anything recede 
from this cause, which is not only ours, but that of all Christendom, and concerns 
the highest treasure, Jesus Christ.]
91] We have declared for what reasons we assigned to repentance these two parts, 
contrition and faith. And we have done this the more readily because many 
expressions concerning repentance are published which are cited in a mutilated 
form from the Fathers [Augustine and the other ancient Fathers], and which the 
adversaries have distorted in order to put faith out of sight. Such are: Repentance 
is to lament past evils, and not to commit again deeds that ought to be lamented. 
Again: Repentance is a kind of vengeance of him who grieves, thus punishing in 
himself what he is sorry for having committed. In these passages no mention is 
made of faith. And not even in the schools, when they interpret, is anything 92] 
added concerning faith. Therefore, in order that the doctrine of faith might be 
the more conspicuous, we have enumerated it among the parts of repentance. For 
the actual fact shows that those passages which require contrition or good works, 
and make no mention of justifying faith, 93] are dangerous [as experience proves]. 
And prudence can justly be desired in those who have collected these centos of 
the “Sentences” and decrees. For since the Fathers speak in some places concerning 
one part, and in other places concerning another part of repentance, it would have 
been well to select and combine their judgments not only concerning one part but 
concerning both, i.e., concerning contrition and faith.
94] For Tertullian speaks excellently concerning faith, dwelling upon the oath in 
the prophet, Ezek. 33:11: As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the 
death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. For as God 
swears that He does not wish the death of a sinner, He shows that faith is required, 
in order that we may believe the one swearing, and be firmly confident that He 
forgives us. The authority of the divine promises ought by itself to be great in our 
estimation. But this promise has also been confirmed by an oath. Therefore, if any 
one be not confident that he is forgiven, he denies that God has sworn what is true, 
than which a more horrible blasphemy cannot be imagined. For Tertullian speaks 
thus: He invites by reward to salvation, even sweating. Saying, “I live,” He desires 
that He be believed. Oh, blessed we, for whose sake God swears! Oh, most miser-
able if we believe not the Lord even when He swears! 95] But here we must know 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
163
that this faith ought to be confident that God freely forgives us for the sake of 
Christ, for the sake of His own promise, not for the sake of our works, contrition, 
confession, or satisfactions. For if faith relies upon these works, it immediately 
becomes uncertain, because the terrified conscience sees that these 96] works 
are unworthy. Accordingly, Ambrose speaks admirably concerning repentance: 
Therefore it is proper for us to believe both that we are to repent, and that we are to be 
pardoned, but so as to expect pardon as from faith, which obtains it as from a handwriting. 
Again: It is faith which covers our sins. 97] Therefore, there are sentences extant in 
the Fathers, not only concerning contrition and works, but also concerning faith. 
But the adversaries, since they understand neither the nature of repentance nor the 
language of the Fathers, select passages concerning a part of repentance, namely, 
concerning works; they pass over the declarations made elsewhere concerning 
faith, since they do not understand them.
Article VI: Of Confession and Satisfaction.
1] Good men can easily judge that it is of the greatest importance that the true 
doctrine concerning the above-mentioned parts, namely contrition and faith, 
be preserved. [For the great fraud of indulgences, etc., and the preposterous 
doctrines of the sophists have sufficiently taught us what great vexation and 
danger arise therefrom if a foul stroke is here made. How many a godly conscience 
under the Papacy sought with great labor the true way, and in the midst, of such 
darkness did not find it!] Therefore, we have always been occupied more with the 
elucidation of these topics, and have disputed nothing as yet concerning confession 
and satisfaction. 2] For we also retain confession, especially on account of the 
absolution, as being the word of God which, by divine authority, the power of 
the keys pronounces upon individuals. 3] Therefore it would be wicked to remove 
private absolution from the Church. 4] Neither do they understand what the 
remission of sins or the power of the keys is, if there are any who despise private 
absolution. 
5] But in reference to the enumeration of offenses in confession, we have said 
above that we hold that it is not 6] necessary by divine right. For the objection, 
made by some, that a judge ought to investigate a case before he pronounces upon 
it, pertains in no way to this subject; because the ministry of absolution is favor or 
grace, it is not a legal process, or law. [For God is the Judge, who has committed to 
the apostles, not the office of judges, but the administration of grace, namely, to 
acquit those who desire, etc.] Therefore ministers in the Church have the command 
to remit sin; they have not the command to investigate secret 8] sins. And indeed, 
they absolve from those that we do not remember; for which reason absolution, 
The Lutheran Confessions
164
which is the voice of the Gospel remitting sins and consoling consciences, does not 
require judicial examination.
9] And it is ridiculous to transfer hither the saying of Solomon, Prov. 27:23: Be thou 
diligent to know the state of thy flocks. For Solomon says nothing of confession, 
but gives to the father of a family a domestic precept, that he should use what is 
his own, and abstain from what is another’s; and he commands him to take care of 
his own property diligently, yet in such a way that, with his mind occupied with 
the increase of his resources, he should not cast away the fear of God, or faith or 
care in God’s Word. But our adversaries, by a wonderful metamorphosis, transform 
passages of Scripture to whatever meaning they please. [They produce from the 
Scriptures black and white, as they please, contrary to the natural meaning of the 
clear words.] Here to know signifies with them to hear confessions, the state, not the 
outward life, but the secrets of conscience; and the flocks signify men. [Stable, we 
think, means a school within which there are such doctors and orators. But it has 
happened aright to those who thus despise the Holy Scriptures and all fine arts 
that they make gross mistakes in grammar.] The interpretation is assuredly neat, 
and is worthy of these despisers of the pursuits of eloquence. But if any one desires 
by a similitude to transfer a precept from a father of a family to a pastor of a 
Church, he ought certainly to interpret “state” [V. vultus, countenance] as applying 
to the outward life. This similitude will be more consistent.
10] But let us omit such matters as these. At different times in the Psalms mention 
is made of confession, as, Ps. 32:5: I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the 
Lord; and Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Such confession of sin which is 
made to God is contrition itself. For when confession is made to God, it must be 
made with the heart, not alone with the voice, as is made on the stage by ac-
tors. Therefore, such confession is contrition, in which, feeling God’s wrath, we 
confess that God is justly angry, and that He cannot be appeased by our works, 
and, nevertheless, we seek for mercy because of God’s promise. 11] Such is the 
following confession, Ps. 51:4: Against Thee only have I sinned, that Thou mightest 
be justified, and be clear when Thou judgest, i.e., “I confess that I am a sinner, and 
have merited eternal wrath, nor can I set my righteousnesses, my merits, against 
Thy wrath; accordingly, I declare that Thou art just when Thou condemnest and 
punishest us; I declare that Thou art clear when hypocrites judge Thee to be unjust 
in punishing them or in condemning the well-deserving. Yea, our merits cannot be 
opposed to Thy judgment; but we shall thus be justified, namely, if Thou justifiest 
us, if through Thy mercy Thou accountest us righteous.” 12] Perhaps some one 
may also cite Jas. 5:16: Confess your faults one to another. But here the reference is 
not to confession that is to be made to the priests, but, in general, concerning the 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
165
reconciliation of brethren to each other. For it commands that the confession be 
mutual.
13] Again, our adversaries will condemn many most generally received teachers 
if they will contend that in confession an enumeration of offenses is necessary 
according to divine Law. For although we approve of confession, and judge 
that some examination is of advantage, in order that men may be the better 
instructed [young and inexperienced persons be questioned], yet the matter must 
be so controlled that snares are not cast upon consciences, which never will be 
tranquil if they think that they cannot obtain the remission of sins, unless this 
precise enumeration be made. 14] That which the adversaries have expressed in 
the Confutation is certainly most false, namely, that a full confession is necessary 
for salvation. For this is impossible. And what snares they here cast upon the 
conscience when they require a full confession! For when will conscience be sure 
that the confession is complete? 15] In the Church-writers mention is made of 
confession, but they do not speak of this enumeration of secret offenses, but 
of the rite of public repentance. For as the fallen or notorious [those guilty of 
public crimes] were not received without fixed satisfactions [without a public 
ceremony or reproof], they made confession on this account to the presbyters, in 
order that satisfactions might be prescribed to them according to the measure of 
their offenses. This entire matter contained nothing similar to the enumeration 
concerning which we are disputing. This confession was made, not because the 
remission of sins before God could not occur without it, but because satisfactions 
could not be prescribed unless the kind of offense were first known. For different 
offenses had different canons.
16] And from this rite of public repentance there has been left the word “satisfac-
tion.” For the holy Fathers were unwilling to receive the fallen or the notorious, 
unless, as far as it was possible, their repentance had been first examined into 
and exhibited publicly. And there seem to have been many causes for this. For to 
chastise those who had fallen served as an example, just as also the gloss upon the 
decrees admonishes, and it was improper immediately to admit notorious men to 
the communion [without their being tested]. These customs have long since grown 
obsolete. Neither is it necessary to restore them, because they are not necessary for 
the remission of sins before God. 17] Neither did the Fathers hold this, namely, 
that men merit the remission of sins through such customs or such works, although 
these spectacles (such outward ceremonies] usually lead astray the ignorant to 
think that by these works they merit the remission of sins before God. But if any 
one thus holds, he holds to the faith of a Jew and heathen. For also the heathen had 
certain expiations for offenses through which they imagined 18] to be reconciled to 
The Lutheran Confessions

God. Now, however, although the custom has become obsolete, the name satisfac-
tion still remains, and a trace of the custom also remains of prescribing in con-
fession certain satisfactions, which they define as works that are not due. We call 
them canonical satisfactions. 19] Of these we hold, just as of the enumeration, that 
canonical satisfactions [these public ceremonies] are not necessary by divine Law 
for the remission of sins; just as those ancient exhibitions of satisfactions in public 
repentance were not necessary by divine Law for the remission of sins. For the 
belief concerning faith must be retained, that by faith we obtain remission of sins 
for Christ’s sake, and not for the sake of our works that precede or follow [when 
we are converted or born anew in Christ]. And for this reason we have discussed 
especially the question of satisfactions, that by submitting to them the righteous-
ness of faith be not obscured, or men think that for the sake of these works they 
obtain remission of sins. 20] And many sayings that are current in the schools aid 
the error, such as that which they give in the definition of satisfaction, namely, that 
it is wrought for the purpose of appeasing the divine displeasure.
21] But, nevertheless, the adversaries acknowledge that satisfactions are of no 
profit for the remission of guilt. Yet they imagine that satisfactions are of profit in 
redeeming from the punishments, whether of purgatory or other punishments. For 
thus they teach that in the remission of sins, God [without means, alone] remits the 
guilt, and yet, because it belongs to divine justice to punish sin, that He commutes 
eternal into temporal punishment. They add further that a part of this temporal 
punishment is remitted by the power of the keys, but that the rest is redeemed by 
means of satisfactions. Neither can it be understood of what punishments a part is 
remitted by the power of the keys, unless they say that a part of the punishments 
of purgatory is remitted, from which it would follow that satisfactions are only 
punishments redeeming from purgatory. And these satisfactions, they say, avail 
even though they are rendered by those who have relapsed into mortal sin, as 
though indeed the divine displeasure could be appeased by those who are in 
mortal sin. 22] This entire matter is fictitious, and recently fabricated without 
the authority of Scripture and the old writers of the Church. And not even 
Longobardus speaks in this way of satisfactions. 23] The scholastics saw that there 
were satisfactions in the Church; and they did not notice that these exhibitions 
had been instituted both for the purpose of example, and for testing those who 
desired to be received by the Church. In a word, they did not see that it was a 
discipline, and entirely a secular matter. Accordingly, they superstitiously imagined 
that these avail not for discipline before the Church, but for appeasing God. And 
just as in other places they frequently, with great inaptness, have confounded 
spiritual and civil matters [the kingdom of Christ, which is spiritual, and the 
kingdom of the world, and external discipline], the same happens also with regard 
to satisfactions. 24] But the gloss on the canons at various places testifies that these 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
167
observances were instituted for the sake of church discipline [should serve alone 
for an example before the Church].
25] Let us see, moreover, how in the Confutation which they had the presumption 
to obtrude upon His Imperial Majesty, they prove these figments of theirs. They 
cite many passages from the Scriptures, in order to impose upon the inexperienced, 
as though this subject which was unknown even in the time of Longobard, had 
authority from the Scriptures. They bring forward such passages as these: Bring 
forth, therefore, fruits meet for repentance, Matt. 3:8; Mark 1:15. Again: Yield your 
members servants to righteousness, Rom. 6:19. Again, Christ preaches repentance, 
Matt. 4:17: Repent. Again, Christ Luke 24:47, commands the apostles to preach 
repentance, and Peter preaches repentance, Acts 2:38. Afterward they cite certain 
passages of the Fathers and the canons, and conclude that satisfactions in the 
Church are not to be abolished contrary to the plain Gospel and the decrees of 
the Councils and Fathers [against the decision of the Holy Church]; nay, even that 
those who have been absolved by the priest ought to bring to perfection the repen-
tance that has been enjoined, following the declaration of Paul, Titus 2:14: Who 
gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto 
Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
26] May God put to confusion these godless sophists who so wickedly distort God’s 
Word to their own most vain dreams! What good man is there who is not moved 
by such indignity? “Christ says, Repent, the apostles preach repentance; therefore 
eternal punishments are compensated by the punishments of purgatory; therefore 
the keys have the power to remit part of the punishments of purgatory; therefore 
satisfactions redeem the punishments of purgatory”! Who has taught these asses 
such logic? Yet this is neither logic nor sophistry, but cunning trickery. According-
ly, they appeal to the expression repent in such a way that, when the inexperienced 
hear such a passage cited against us, they may derive the opinion that we deny the 
entire repentance. By these arts they endeavor to alienate minds and to enkindle 
hatred, so that the inexperienced may cry out against us [Crucify! crucify!], that 
such pestilent heretics as disapprove of repentance should be removed from their 
midst. [Thus they are publicly convicted of being liars in this matter.]
27] But we hope that among good men these calumnies [and misrepresentations of 
Holy Scripture] may make little headway. And God will not long endure such im-
pudence and wickedness. [They will certainly be consumed by the First and Second 
Commandments.] Neither has the Pope of Rome consulted well for his own dig-
nity in employing such patrons, because he has entrusted a matter of the greatest 
importance to the judgment of these sophists. For since we include in the Con-
fession almost the sum of the entire Christian doctrine, judges should have been 
The Lutheran Confessions
168
appointed to make a declaration concerning matters so important and so many 
and various, whose learning and faith would have been more approved than that of 
these sophists who have written this Confutation. 28] It was particularly becoming 
for you, O Campegius, in accordance with your wisdom, to have taken care that 
in regard to matters of such importance they should write nothing which either at 
this time or with posterity might seem to be able to diminish regard for the Ro-
man See. If the Roman See judges it right that all nations should acknowledge her 
as mistress of the faith, she ought to take pains that learned and uncorrupt men 
make investigation concerning matters of religion. For what will the world judge if 
at any time the writing of the adversaries be brought to light? What will posterity 
judge concerning these reproachful judicial investigations? 29] You see, O Campe-
gius, that these are the last times, in which Christ predicted that there would be 
the greatest danger to religion. You, therefore, who ought, as it were, to sit on the 
watch-tower and control religious matters, should in these times employ unusual 
wisdom and diligence. 
There are many signs which, unless you heed them, threaten a change to the Roman 
state. 30] And you make a mistake if you think that Churches should be retained 
only by force and arms. Men ask to be taught concerning religion. How many 
do you suppose there are, not only in Germany, but also in England, in Spain, 
in France, in Italy, and finally even in the city of Rome, who, since they see that 
controversies have arisen concerning subjects of the greatest importance, are be-
ginning here and there to doubt, and to be silently indignant that you refuse to in-
vestigate and judge aright subjects of such weight as these; that you do not deliver 
wavering consciences; that you only bid us be overthrown and annihilated by arms? 
31] There are many good men to whom this doubt is more bitter than death. You 
do not consider sufficiently how great a subject religion is, if you think that good 
men are in anguish for a slight cause whenever they begin to doubt concerning 
any dogma. And this doubt can have no other effect than to produce the greatest 
bitterness of hatred against those who, when they ought to heal consciences, plant 
themselves in the way of the explanation of the subject. 32] We do not here say that 
you ought to fear God’s judgment. For the hierarchs think that they can easily pro-
vide against this, for since they hold the keys, of course they can open heaven for 
themselves whenever they wish. We are speaking of the judgments of men and the 
silent desires of all nations, which, indeed, at this time require that these matters 
be investigated and decided in such a manner that good minds may be healed and 
freed from doubt. For, in accordance with your wisdom, you can easily decide what 
will take place if at any time this hatred against you should break forth. But by this 
favor you will be able to bind to yourself all nations, as all sane men regard it as the 
highest and most important matter, if you heal doubting 33] consciences. We have 
said these things not because we doubt concerning our Confession. For we know 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
169
that it is true, godly, and useful to godly consciences. But it is likely that there are 
many in many places who waver concerning matters of no light importance, and 
yet do not hear such teachers as are able to heal their consciences.
34] But let us return to the main point. The Scriptures cited by the adversaries 
speak in no way of canonical satisfactions, and of the opinions of the scholastics, 
since it is evident that the latter were only recently born. Therefore it is pure 
slander when they distort Scripture to their own opinions. We say that good fruits, 
good works in every kind of life, ought to follow repentance, i.e., conversion or 
regeneration [the renewal of the Holy Ghost in the heart]. Neither can there be 
true conversion or true contrition where mortifications of the flesh and good fruits 
do not follow [if we do not externally render good works and Christian patience]. 
True terrors, true griefs of mind, do not allow the body to indulge in sensual 
pleasures, and true faith is not ungrateful to God, neither does it despise God’s 
commandments. 35] In a word, there is no inner repentance unless it also produces 
outwardly mortifications of the flesh. We say also that this is the meaning of John 
when he says, Matt. 3:8: Bring forth, therefore, fruits meet for repentance. Likewise 
of Paul when he says, Rom. 6:19: Yield your members servants to righteousness; 
just as he likewise says elsewhere, Rom. 12:1: Present your bodies a living sacrifice, 
etc. And when Christ says, Matt. 4:17: Repent, He certainly speaks of the entire 
repentance, of the entire newness of life and its fruits; He does not speak of those 
hypocritical satisfactions which, the scholastics imagine, avail for compensating 
the punishment of purgatory or other punishments when they are made by those 
who are in mortal sin.
36] Many arguments, likewise, can be collected to show that these passages of 
Scripture pertain in no way to scholastic satisfactions. These men imagine that 
satisfactions are works that are not due [which we are not obliged to do]; but 
Scripture, in these passages, requires works that are due [which we are obliged to 
do]. For this word of Christ, 37] Repent, is the word of a commandment. Likewise 
the adversaries write that if any one who goes to confession should refuse to 
undertake satisfactions, he does not sin, but will pay these penalties in purgatory. 
Now the following passages are, without controversy, precepts pertaining to this 
life: Repent; Bring forth fruits meet for repentance; Yield your members servants 
to righteousness. Therefore they cannot be distorted to the satisfactions which it 
is permitted to refuse. For to refuse God’s commandments is not permitted. [For 
God’s commands are not thus left to our discretion.] 38] Thirdly, indulgences remit 
these satisfactions, as is taught by the Chapter, De Poenitentiis et Remissione, begin-
ning Quum ex eo, etc. But indulgences do not free us from the commandments: Re-
pent; Bring forth fruits meet for repentance. Therefore it is manifest that these pas-
sages of Scripture have been wickedly distorted to apply to canonical satisfactions. 
The Lutheran Confessions
170
39] See further what follows. If the punishments of purgatory are satisfactions, 
or satispassions [sufferings sufficient], or if satisfactions are a redemption of the 
punishments of purgatory, do the passages also give commandment that souls be 
punished in purgatory? [The above-cited passages of Christ and Paul must also 
show and prove that souls enter purgatory and there suffer pain.] Since this must 
follow from the opinions of the adversaries, these passages should be interpreted 
in a new way [these passages should put on new coats]: Bring forth fruits meet for 
repentance; Repent, i.e., suffer the punishments of purgatory after this life. 40]But 
we do not care about refuting in more words these absurdities of the adversaries. 
For it is evident that Scripture speaks of works that are due, of the entire newness, 
of life, and not of these observances of works that are not due, of which the ad-
versaries speak. And yet, by these figments they defend orders [of monks], the sale 
of Masses and infinite observances, namely, as works which, if they do not make 
satisfaction for guilt, yet make satisfaction for punishment.
41] Since, therefore, the passages of Scripture cited do not say that eternal punish-
ments are to be compensated by works that are not due, the adversaries are rash in 
affirming that these satisfactions are compensated by canonical satisfactions. Nor 
do the keys have the command to commute some punishments, and likewise to 
remit a part of the punishments. For where are such things [dreams and lies] read 
in the Scriptures? Christ speaks of the remission of sins when He says, Matt. 18:18: 
Whatsoever ye shall loose, etc. [i.e.], sin being forgiven, death eternal is taken away, 
and life eternal bestowed. Nor does Whatsoever ye shall bind speak of the impos-
ing of punishments, but of retaining the sins of those who are not converted. 42] 
Moreover, the declaration of Longobard concerning remitting a part of the punish-
ments has been taken from the canonical punishments; a part of these the pastors 
remitted. Although, therefore, we hold that repentance ought to bring forth good 
fruits for the sake of God’s glory and command, and good fruits, true fastings, true 
prayers, true alms, etc., have the commands of God, yet in the Holy Scriptures we 
nowhere find this, namely, that eternal punishments are not remitted except on 
account of the punishment of purgatory or canonical satisfactions, i.e., on account 
of certain works not due, or that the power of the keys has the command to com-
mute their punishments or to remit a portion. These things the adversaries were to 
prove. [This they will not attempt.]
43] Besides, the death of Christ is a satisfaction not only for guilt, but also for eter-
nal death, according to Hos. 13:14: O death, I will be thy death. How monstrous, 
therefore, it is to say that the satisfaction of Christ redeemed from the guilt, and 
our punishments redeem from eternal death; as the expression, I will be thy death, 
ought then to be understood, not concerning Christ, but concerning our works, 
and, indeed, not concerning the works commanded by God, but concerning some 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
171
frigid observances devised by men! And these are said to abolish death, 44] even 
when they are wrought in mortal sin. It is incredible with what grief we recite 
these absurdities of the adversaries, which cannot but cause one who considers 
them to be enraged against such doctrines of demons, which the devil has spread in 
the Church in order to suppress the knowledge of the Law and Gospel, of repen-
tance and quickening, and the benefits 45] of Christ. For of the Law they speak 
thus: “God, condescending to our weakness, has given to man a measure of those 
things to which of necessity he is bound; and this is the observance of precepts, so 
that from what is left, i.e., from works of supererogation, he can render satisfaction 
with reference to offenses that have been committed.” Here men imagine that they 
can observe the Law of God in such a manner as to be able to do even more than 
the Law exacts. But Scripture everywhere exclaims that we are far distant from the 
perfection which the Law requires. Yet these men imagine that the Law of God has 
been comprised in outward and civil righteousness; they do not see that it requires 
true love to God “with the whole heart,” etc., and condemns the entire concupis-
cence in the nature. Therefore no one does as much as the Law requires. Hence 
their imagination that we can do more is ridiculous. For although we can perform 
outward works not commanded by God’s Law [which Paul calls beggarly ordinanc-
es], yet the confidence that satisfaction is rendered God’s Law [yea, that more is 
done than God demands] is vain and wicked. 
46] And true prayers, true alms, true fastings, have God’s command; and where 
they have God’s command, they cannot without sin be omitted. But these works, 
in so far as they have not been commanded by God’s Law, but have a fixed form 
derived from human rule, are works of human traditions of which Christ says, 
Matt. 15:9: In vain they do worship Me with the commandments of men, such as 
certain fasts appointed not for restraining the flesh, but that, by this work, honor 
may be given to God, as Scotus says, and eternal death be made up for; likewise, 
a fixed number of prayers, a fixed measure of alms when they are rendered in 
such a way that this measure is a worship ex opere operato, giving honor to God, 
and making up for eternal death. For they ascribe satisfaction to these ex opere 
operato, because they teach that they avail even in those who are 47] in mortal sin. 
There are works which depart still farther from God’s commands, as [rosaries and] 
pilgrimages; and of these there is a great variety: one makes a journey [to St. Jacob] 
clad in mail, and another with bare feet. Christ calls these “vain acts of worship,” 
and hence they do not serve to appease God’s displeasure, as the adversaries say. 
And yet they adorn these works with magnificent titles; they call them works of 
supererogation; to them the honor is ascribed of being a price paid instead of eter-
nal death. 48] Thus they are preferred to the works of God’s commandments [the 
true works expressly mentioned in the Ten Commandments]. In this way the Law 
of God is obscured in two ways, one, because satisfaction is thought to be rendered 
The Lutheran Confessions
172
God’s Law by means of outward and civil works, the other, because human tradi-
tions are added, whose works are preferred to the works of the divine Law.
49] In the second place, repentance and grace are obscured. For eternal death is 
not atoned for by this compensation of works, because it is idle, and does not in 
the present life taste of death. Something else must be opposed to death when it 
tries us. For just as the wrath of God is overcome by faith in Christ, so death is 
overcome by faith in, Christ. Just as Paul says, 1 Cor. 15:57: But thanks be to God 
which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. He does not say: “Who 
giveth us the victory if we oppose our satisfactions against death.” 50] The adver-
saries treat of idle speculations concerning the remission of guilt, and do not see 
how, in the remission of guilt, the heart is freed by faith in Christ from God’s anger 
and eternal death. Since, therefore, the death of Christ is a satisfaction for eternal 
death, and since the adversaries themselves confess that these works of satisfac-
tions are works that are not due, but are works of human traditions, of which 
Christ says, Matt. 15:9, that they are vain acts of worship, we can safely affirm that 
canonical satisfactions are not necessary by divine Law for the remission of guilt, 
or eternal punishment, or the punishment of purgatory.
51] But the adversaries object that vengeance or punishment is necessary for re-
pentance, because Augustine says that repentance is vengeance punishing, etc. We 
grant that vengeance or punishment is necessary in repentance, yet not as merit or 
price, as the adversaries imagine that satisfactions are. But vengeance is in repen-
tance formally, i.e., because regeneration itself occurs by a perpetual mortification 
of the oldness of life. The saying of Scotus may indeed be very beautiful, that poeni-
tentia is so called because it is, as it were, poenae tenentia, holding to punishment. 
But of what punishment, of what vengeance, does Augustine speak? Certainly of 
true punishment, of true vengeance, namely, of contrition, of true terrors. Nor do 
we here exclude the outward mortifications of the body, which 52] follow true grief 
of mind. The adversaries make a great mistake if they imagine that canonical sat-
isfactions [their juggler’s tricks, rosaries, pilgrimages, and such like] are more truly 
punishments than are true terrors in the heart. It is most foolish to distort the 
name of punishment to these frigid satisfactions, and not to refer them to those 
horrible terrors of conscience of which David says, Ps. 18:4; 2 Sam. 22:5: The sorrows 
of death compassed me. Who would not rather, clad in mail and equipped, seek the 
church of James, the basilica of Peter, etc., than bear that ineffable violence of grief 
which exists even in persons of ordinary lives, if there be true repentance?
53] But they say that it belongs to God’s justice to punish sin. He certainly punish-
es it in contrition, when in these terrors He shows His wrath. Just as David indi-
cates when he prays, Ps. 6:1: O Lord, rebuke me not in Thine anger. And Jeremiah 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
173
10:24: O Lord, correct me, but with judgment; not in Thine anger, lest Thou bring 
me to nothing. Here indeed the most bitter punishments are spoken of. And the 
adversaries acknowledge that contrition can be so great that satisfaction is not 
required. 54] Contrition is therefore more truly a punishment than is satisfaction. 
Besides, saints are subject to death, and all general afflictions, as 1 Peter 4:17 says: 
For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God; and if it first 
begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the Gospel of God? And 
although these afflictions are for the most part the punishments of sin, yet in the 
godly they have a better end, namely, to exercise them, that they may learn amidst 
trials to seek God’s aid, to acknowledge the distrust of their own hearts, etc., as 
Paul says of himself, 2 Cor. 1:9: But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that 
we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead. And Isaiah 
says, 26:16: They poured out prayer when Thy chastening was upon them, i.e., afflic-
tions are a discipline 55] by which God exercises the saints. Likewise afflictions are 
inflicted because of present sin, since in the saints they mortify and extinguish con-
cupiscence, so that they may be renewed by the Spirit, as Paul says, Rom. 8:10: The 
body is dead because of sin, i.e., it is mortified [more and more every day] because 
of present sin which is still left in the flesh. 
56] And death itself serves this purpose, namely, to abolish this flesh of sin, that 
we may rise absolutely new. Neither is there now in the death of the believer, since 
by faith he has overcome the terrors of death, that sting and sense of wrath of 
which Paul speaks 1 Cor. 15:56: The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is 
the Law. This strength of sin, this sense of wrath, is truly a punishment as long as 
it is present; without this sense of wrath, 57] death is not properly a punishment. 
Moreover, canonical satisfactions do not belong to these punishments; as the 
adversaries say that by the power of the keys a part of the punishments is remitted. 
Likewise, according to these very men, the keys remit the satisfactions, and the 
punishments on account of which the satisfactions are made. But it is evident that 
the common afflictions are not removed by the power of the keys. And if they wish 
to be understood concerning these punishments, why do they add that satisfaction 
is to be rendered in purgatory?
58] They oppose the example of Adam, and also of David, who was punished for his 
adultery. From these examples they derive the universal rule that peculiar temporal 
punishments in the remission of sins correspond to individual sins. 59] It has been 
said before that saints suffer punishments, which are works of God; they suffer 
contrition or terrors, they also suffer other common afflictions. Thus, for example, 
some suffer punishments of their own that have been imposed by God. And these 
punishments pertain in no way to the keys, because the keys neither can impose 
The Lutheran Confessions
174
nor remit them, but God, without the ministry of the keys, imposes and remits 
them [as He will].
Neither does the universal rule follow: Upon David a peculiar punishment was im-
posed, therefore, in addition to common afflictions, there is another punishment 
of purgatory, in which each degree corresponds to each sin. 60] Where does Scrip-
ture teach that we cannot be freed from eternal death except by the compensation 
of certain punishments in addition to common afflictions? But, on the other hand, 
it most frequently teaches that the remission of sins occurs freely for Christ’s sake, 
that Christ is the Victor of sin and death. Therefore the merit of satisfaction is not 
to be patched upon this. And although afflictions still remain, yet Scripture inter-
prets these as the mortifications of present sin [to kill and humble the old Adam], 
and not as the compensations of eternal death or as prices for eternal death.
61] Job is excused that he was not afflicted on account of past evil deeds; therefore 
afflictions are not always punishments or signs of wrath. Yea, terrified consciences 
are to be taught that other ends of afflictions are more important [that they should 
learn to regard troubles far differently, namely, as signs of grace], lest they think 
that they are rejected by God when in afflictions they see nothing but God’s pun-
ishment and anger. The other more important ends are to be considered, namely, 
that God is doing His strange work so that He may be able to do His own work, 
etc., as Isaiah 28:1ff teaches in a long discourse. 62] And when the disciples asked 
concerning the blind man who sinned, John 9:2-3, Christ replies that the cause of 
his blindness is not sin, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. 
And in Jeremiah 49:12, it is said: They whose judgment was not to drink of the cup 
have assuredly drunken. Thus the prophets and John the Baptist and other saints 
were killed. 63] Therefore afflictions are not always punishments for certain past 
deeds, but they are the works of God, intended for our profit, and that the power 
of God might be made more manifest in our weakness [how He can help in the 
midst of death].
Thus Paul says, 2 Cor. 12:5,9: The strength of God is made perfect in my weakness. 
Therefore, because of God’s will, our bodies ought to be sacrifices, to declare our 
obedience [and patience], and not to compensate for eternal death. for which God 
has another price, namely, 64] the death of His own Son. And in this sense Gregory 
interprets even the punishment of David when he says: If God on account of that sin 
had threatened that he, would thus be humbled by his son, why, when the sin was forgiven, 
did He fulfil that which He had threatened against him? The reply is that this remission 
was made that man might not be hindered from receiving eternal life, but that the example 
of the threatening followed, in order that the piety of the man might be exercised and 
tested even in this humility. Thus also God inflicted upon man death of body on account of 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
175
sin, and after the remission of sins He did not remove it, for the sake of exercising justice, 
namely, in order that the righteousness of those who are sanctified might be exercised and 
tested.
65] Nor, indeed, are common calamities [as war, famine, and similar calamities], 
properly speaking, removed by these works of canonical satisfactions, i.e., by 
these works of human traditions, which, they say, avail ex opere operato, in such 
a way that, even though they are wrought in mortal sin, 66] yet they redeem 
from the punishments. [And the adversaries themselves confess that they impose 
satisfactions, not on account of such common calamities, but on account of 
purgatory; hence, their satisfactions are pure imaginations and dreams.] And when 
the passage of Paul, 1 Cor. 11:31, is cited against us: If we would judge ourselves, 
we should not be judged by the Lord [they conclude therefrom that, if we impose 
punishment upon ourselves, God will judge us the more graciously], the word to 
judge ought to be understood of the entire repentance and due fruits, not of works 
which are not due. Our adversaries pay the penalty for despising grammar when 
they understand to judge to be the same as to make a pilgrimage clad in mail to the 
church of St. James, or similar works. To judge signifies the entire repentance; it 
signifies to condemn sins. 
67] This condemnation truly occurs in contrition and the change of life. The entire 
repentance, contrition, faith, the good fruits, obtain the mitigation of public and 
private punishments and calamities, as Isaiah 1:17-19 teaches: Cease to do evil; learn 
to do well, etc. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow. If ye be 
willing and obedient, 68] ye shall eat the good of the land. Neither should a most 
important and salutary meaning be transferred from the entire repentance, and 
from works due or commanded by God, to the satisfactions and works of human 
traditions. And this it is profitable to teach, that common evils are mitigated by 
our repentance and by the true fruits of repentance, by good works wrought from 
faith, not, as these men imagine, wrought in mortal sin. 69] And here belongs the 
example of the Ninevites, Jonah 3:10, who by their repentance (we speak of the 
entire repentance) were reconciled to God, and obtained the favor that their city 
was not destroyed.
70] Moreover, the making mention, by the Fathers, of satisfaction, and the framing 
of canons by the councils, we have said above, was a matter of church-discipline 
instituted on account of the example. Nor did they hold that this discipline is 
necessary for the remission either of the guilt or of the punishment. For if some of 
them made mention of purgatory, they interpret it not as compensation for eternal 
punishment [which only Christ makes], not as satisfaction, but as purification of 
imperfect souls. Just as Augustine says that venial [daily] offenses are consumed, 
The Lutheran Confessions
176
i.e., distrust towards God and other 71] similar dispositions are mortified. Now 
and then the writers transfer the term satisfaction from the rite itself or spectacle, 
to signify true mortification. Thus Augustine says: True satisfaction is to cut off the 
causes of sin, i.e., to mortify the flesh, likewise to restrain the flesh, not in order 
that eternal punishments may be compensated for, but so that the flesh may not 
allure to sin.
72] Thus concerning restitution, Gregory says that repentance is false if it does 
not satisfy those whose property we have taken. For he who still steals does not 
truly grieve that he has stolen or robbed. For he is a thief or robber, so long as he is 
the unjust possessor of the property of another. This civil satisfaction is necessary, 
because it is written Eph. 4:28: Let him that stole, 73] steal no more. Likewise 
Chrysostom says: In the heart, contrition; in the mouth, confession; in the work, 
entire humility. This amounts to nothing against us. Good works ought to follow 
repentance; it ought to be repentance, not simulation, but a change of the entire 
life for the better.
74] Likewise, the Fathers wrote that it is sufficient if once in life this public or 
ceremonial penitence occur, about which the canons concerning satisfactions have 
been made. Therefore it can be understood that they held that these canons are not 
necessary for the remission of sins. For in addition to this ceremonial penitence, 
they frequently wish that penitence be rendered otherwise, where canons of 
satisfactions were not required.
75] The composers of the Confutation write that the abolition of satisfactions 
contrary to the plain Gospel is not to be endured. We, therefore, have thus far 
shown that these canonical satisfactions, i.e., works not due, and that are to be 
performed in order to compensate for punishment, have not 76] the command of 
the Gospel. The subject itself shows this. If works of satisfaction are works which 
are not due, why do they cite the plain Gospel? For if the Gospel would command 
that punishments be compensated for by such works, the works would already 
be due. But thus they speak in order to impose upon the inexperienced, and they 
cite testimonies which speak of works that are due, although they themselves 
in their own satisfactions prescribe works that are not due. Yea, in their schools 
they themselves concede that satisfactions can be refused without [mortal] sin. 
Therefore they here write falsely that we are compelled by the plain Gospel to 
undertake these canonical satisfactions. ‘
77] But we have already frequently testified that repentance ought to produce 
good fruits; and what the good fruits are the [Ten] Commandments teach, namely, 
[truly and from the heart most highly to esteem, fear, and love God, joyfully to call 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
177
upon Him in need], prayer, thanksgiving, the confession of the Gospel [hearing 
this Word], to teach the Gospel, to obey parents and magistrates, to be faithful to 
one’s calling, not to kill, not to retain hatred, but to be forgiving [to be agreeable 
and kind to one’s neighbor], to give to the needy, so far as we can according to 
our means, not to commit fornication or adultery, but to restrain and bridle and 
chastise the flesh, not for a compensation of eternal punishment, but so as not to 
obey the devil, or offend the Holy Ghost; likewise, to speak the truth. These fruits 
have God’s injunction, and ought to be brought forth for the sake of God’s glory 
and command; and they have their rewards also. But that eternal punishments are 
not remitted except on account of the compensation rendered by certain traditions 
or by purgatory, Scripture does not teach. 
78] Indulgences were formerly remission of these public observances, so that men 
should not be excessively burdened. But if, by human authority, satisfactions and 
punishments can be remitted, this compensation, therefore, is not necessary by di-
vine Law; for a divine Law is not annulled by human authority. Furthermore, since 
the custom has now of itself become obsolete and the bishops have passed it by in 
silence, there is no necessity for these remissions. And yet the name indulgences 
remained. And just as satisfactions were understood not with reference to external 
discipline, but with reference to the compensation of punishment, so indulgences 
were incorrectly understood to free souls from purgatory. 79] But the keys have 
not the power of binding and loosing except upon earth, according to Matt. 16:19: 
Whatsoever, thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever 
thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Although, as we have said 
above, the keys have not the power to impose penalties, or to institute rites of 
worship, but only the command to remit sins to those who are converted, and to 
convict and excommunicate those who are unwilling to be converted. For just as to 
loose signifies to remit sins, so to bind signifies not to remit sins. For Christ speaks 
of a spiritual kingdom. And the command of God is that the ministers of the Gos-
pel should absolve those who are converted, according to 2 Cor. 10:8: The authority 
which the Lord hath given us for edification. Therefore 80] the reservation of cases 
is a secular affair. For it is a reservation of canonical punishment; it is not a reserva-
tion of guilt before God in those who are truly converted. Therefore the adversaries 
judge aright when they confess that in the article of death the reservation of cases 
ought not to hinder absolution.
81] We have set forth the sum of our doctrine concerning repentance, which we 
certainly know is godly and salutary to good minds [and highly necessary]. And if 
good men will compare our [yea, Christ’s and His apostles’] doctrine with the very 
confused discussions of our adversaries, they will perceive that the adversaries have 
omitted the doctrine [without which no one can teach or learn anything that is 
The Lutheran Confessions
178
substantial and Christian] concerning faith justifying and consoling godly hearts. 
They will also see that the adversaries invent many things concerning the merits of 
attrition, concerning the endless enumeration of offenses, concerning satisfactions; 
they say things (that touch neither earth nor heaven] agreeing neither with human 
nor divine law, and which not even the adversaries themselves can satisfactorily 
explain.
Article XIII. (VII): Of the Number and Use of the Sacraments.
1] In the Thirteenth Article the adversaries approve our statement that the Sacra-
ments are not only marks of profession among men, as some imagine, but that they 
are rather signs and testimonies of God’s will toward us, through which God moves 
2] hearts to believe [are not mere signs whereby men may recognize each other, as 
the watchword in war, livery, etc., but are efficacious signs and sure testimonies, 
etc.]. But here they bid us also count seven sacraments. We hold that it should be 
maintained that the matters and ceremonies instituted in the Scriptures, whatever 
the number, be not neglected. Neither do we believe it to be of any consequence, 
though, for the purpose of teaching, different people reckon differently, provided 
they still preserve aright the matters handed down in Scripture. Neither have the 
ancients reckoned in the same manner. [But concerning this number of seven sac-
raments, the fact is that the Fathers have not been uniform in their enumeration; 
thus also these seven ceremonies are not equally necessary.]
3] If we call Sacraments rites which have the command of God, and to which the promise 
of grace has been added, it is easy to decide what are properly Sacraments. For rites 
instituted by men will not in this way be Sacraments properly so called. For it does 
not belong to human authority to promise grace. Therefore signs instituted with-
out God’s command are not sure signs of grace, even though they perhaps instruct 
the rude [children or the uncultivated], or admonish as to something [as a painted 
cross]. 4] Therefore Baptism, the Lord’s Supper, and Absolution, which is the Sacra-
ment of Repentance, are truly Sacraments. For these rites have God’s command 
and the promise of grace, which is peculiar to the New Testament. For when we are 
baptized, when we eat the Lord’s body, when we are absolved, our hearts must be 
firmly assured that God truly forgives us 5] for Christ’s sake. And God, at the same 
time, by the Word and by the rite, moves hearts to believe and conceive faith, just 
as Paul says, Rom. 10:17: Faith cometh by hearing. But just as the Word enters the 
ear in order to strike our heart, so the rite itself strikes the eye, in order to move 
the heart. The effect of the Word and of the rite is the same, as it has been well said 
by Augustine that a Sacrament is a visible word, because the rite is received by 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
179
the eyes, and is, as it were, a picture of the Word, signifying the same thing as the 
Word. Therefore the effect of both is the same.
6] Confirmation and Extreme Unction are rites received from the Fathers which not 
even the Church requires as necessary to salvation, because they do not have God’s 
command. Therefore it is not useless to distinguish these rites from the former, 
which have God’s express command and a clear promise of grace.
7] The adversaries understand priesthood not of the ministry of the Word, and 
administering the Sacraments to others, but they understand it as referring to 
sacrifice; as though in the New Testament there ought to be a priesthood like the 
Levitical, to sacrifice for the people, and merit the remission of sins for others. 8]
We teach that the sacrifice of Christ dying on the cross has been sufficient for the 
sins of the whole world, and that there is no need, besides, of other sacrifices, as 
though this were not sufficient for our sins. Men, accordingly, are justified not 
because of any other sacrifices, but because of this one sacrifice of Christ, if they 
believe that they have been redeemed by this sacrifice. 9] They are accordingly 
called priests, not in order to make any sacrifices for the people as in the Law, so 
that by these they may merit remission of sins for the people; but they are called to 
teach the Gospel and administer the Sacraments to the people. 10] Nor do we have 
another priesthood like the Levitical, 11] as the Epistle to the Hebrews sufficiently 
teaches. But if ordination be understood as applying to the ministry of the Word, 
we are not unwilling to call ordination a sacrament. For the ministry of the Word 
has God’s command and glorious promises, Rom. 1:16: The Gospel is the power 
of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. Likewise, Is. 55:11: So shall My 
Word be that goeth forth out of My mouth; it shall not return unto Me void, but it 
shall accomplish that which I please. 12] If ordination be understood in this way, 
neither will we refuse to call the imposition of hands a sacrament. For the Church 
has the command to appoint ministers, which should be most pleasing to us, 
because we know that God approves this ministry, and is present in the ministry 
[that God will preach and work through men and those who have been chosen by 
men]. 13] And it is of advantage, so far as can be done, to adorn the ministry of the 
Word with every kind of praise against fanatical men, who dream that the Holy 
Ghost is given not through the Word, but because of certain preparations of their 
own, if they sit unoccupied and silent in obscure places, waiting for illumination, 
as the Enthusiasts formerly taught, and the Anabaptists now teach.
14] Matrimony was not first instituted in the New Testament, but in the beginning, 
immediately on the creation of the human race. It has, moreover, God’s command; 
it has also promises, not indeed properly pertaining to the New Testament, but 
The Lutheran Confessions
180
pertaining rather to the bodily life. Wherefore, if any one should wish to call it 
a sacrament, he ought still to distinguish it from those preceding ones [the two 
former ones], which are properly signs of the New Testament, and testimonies of 
grace and the remission of sins. 15] But if marriage will have the name of sacra-
ment for the reason that it has God’s command, other states or offices also, which 
have God’s command, may be called sacraments, as, for example, the magistracy.
16] Lastly, if among the Sacraments all things ought to be numbered which have 
God’s command, and to which promises have been added, why do we not add 
prayer, which most truly can be called a sacrament? For it has both God’s command 
and very many promises; and if placed among the Sacraments, as though in a more 
eminent place, it would invite men to pray. 17] Alms could also be reckoned here, 
and likewise afflictions, which are, even themselves signs, to which God has added 
promises. But let us omit these things. For no prudent man will strive greatly con-
cerning the number or the term, if only those objects still be retained which have 
God’s command and promises.
18] It is still more needful to understand how the Sacraments are to be used. Here 
we condemn the whole crowd of scholastic doctors, who teach that the Sacraments 
confer grace ex opere operato, without a good disposition on the part of the one us-
ing them, provided he do not place a hindrance in the way. This is absolutely a Jew-
ish opinion, to hold that we are justified by a ceremony, without a good disposition 
of the heart, i.e., without faith. And yet this impious and pernicious opinion 19] is 
taught with great authority throughout the entire realm of the Pope. Paul contra-
dicts this, and denies, Rom. 4:9, that Abraham was justified by circumcision, but 
asserts that circumcision was a sign presented for exercising faith. Thus we teach 
that in the use of the Sacraments faith ought to be added, which should believe 
these promises, and receive the promised things, there offered in the Sacrament. 
20] And the reason is plain and thoroughly grounded. [This is a certain and true 
use of the holy Sacrament, on which Christian hearts and consciences may risk to 
rely.] The promise is useless unless it is received by faith. But the Sacraments are 
the signs [and seals] of the promises. Therefore, in the use of the Sacraments faith 
ought to be added, so that, if any one use the Lord’s Supper, he use it thus. Because 
this is a Sacrament of the New Testament, as Christ clearly says, he ought for this 
very reason to be confident that what is promised in the New Testament, namely, 
the free remission of sins, is offered him. And let him receive this by faith, let him 
comfort his alarmed conscience, and know that these testimonies are not falla-
cious, but as sure as though [and still surer than if] God by a new miracle would de-
clare from heaven that it was His will to grant forgiveness. But of what advantage 
would these miracles and promises be to an unbeliever? 21] And here we speak of 
special faith which believes the present promise, not only that which in general 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
181
believes that God exists, but which believes that the remission of sins is offered. 22] 
This use of the Sacrament consoles godly and alarmed minds.
23] Moreover, no one can express in words what abuses in the Church this fanatical 
opinion concerning the opus operatum, without a good disposition on the part of 
the one using the Sacraments, has produced. Hence the infinite profanation of the 
Masses; but of this we shall speak below. Neither can a single letter be produced 
from the old writers which in this matter favors the scholastics. Yea, Augustine 
says the contrary, that the faith of the Sacrament, and not the Sacrament, justifies. 
And the declaration of Paul is well known, Rom. 10:10: With the heart man belie-
veth unto righteousness.
Article XIV: Of Ecclesiastical Order.
24] The Fourteenth Article, in which we say that in the Church the administration 
of the Sacraments and Word ought to be allowed no one unless he be rightly called, 
they receive, but with the proviso that we employ canonical ordination. Concern-
ing this subject we have frequently testified in this assembly that it is our greatest 
wish to maintain church-polity and the grades in the Church [old church-regula-
tions and the government of bishops], even though they have been made by human 
authority [provided the bishops allow our doctrine and receive our priests]. For 
we know that church discipline was instituted by the Fathers, in the manner laid 
down in the ancient canons, with a good and useful intention. 25] But the bishops 
either compel our priests to reject and condemn this kind of doctrine which we 
have confessed, or, by a new and unheard-of cruelty, they put to death the poor 
innocent men. These causes hinder our priests from acknowledging such bishops. 
Thus the cruelty of the bishops is the reason why the canonical government, which 
we greatly desired to maintain, is in some places dissolved. Let them see to it how 
they will give an account to God for dispersing 26] the Church. In this matter our 
consciences are not in danger, because since we know that our Confession is true, 
godly, and catholic, we ought not to approve the cruelty of those who persecute 
this doctrine. 
27] And we know that the Church is among those who teach the Word of God 
aright, and administer the Sacraments aright, and not with those who not only by 
their edicts endeavor to efface God’s Word, but also put to death those who teach 
what is right and true; 28] towards whom, even though they do something contrary 
to the canons, yet the very canons are milder. Furthermore, we wish here again to 
testify that we will gladly maintain ecclesiastical and canonical government, pro-
vided the bishops only cease to rage against our Churches. This our desire will clear 
The Lutheran Confessions
182
us both before God and among all nations to all posterity from the imputation 
against us that the authority of the bishops is being undermined, when men read 
and hear that, although protesting against the unrighteous cruelty of the bishops, 
we could not obtain justice.
Article XV (VIII): Of Human Traditions in the Church.
1] In the Fifteenth Article they receive the first part, in which we say that such 
ecclesiastical rites are to be observed as can be observed without sin, and are of 
profit in the Church for tranquillity and good order. They altogether condemn the 
second part, in which we say that human traditions instituted to appease God, to 
merit grace, and make satisfactions for sins are contrary to the Gospel. 2]Although 
in the Confession itself, when treating of the distinction of meats, we have spoken 
at sufficient length concerning traditions, yet certain things should be briefly 
recounted here.
3] Although we supposed that the adversaries would defend human traditions on 
other grounds, yet we did not think that this would come to pass, namely, that 
they would condemn this article: that we do not merit the remission of sins or 
grace by the observance of human traditions. Since, therefore, this article has been 
condemned, 4] we have an easy and plain case. The adversaries are now openly 
Judaizing, are openly suppressing the Gospel by the doctrines of demons. For 
Scripture calls traditions doctrines of demons, when it is taught that religious rites 
are serviceable to merit the remission of sins and grace. For they are then obscuring 
the Gospel, the benefit of Christ, and 5] the righteousness of faith. [For they are 
just as directly contrary to Christ and to the Gospel as are fire and water to one 
another.] The Gospel teaches that by faith we receive freely, for Christ’s sake, the 
remission of sins and are reconciled to God. The adversaries, on the other hand, 
appoint another mediator, namely, these traditions. On account of these they wish 
to acquire remission of sins; on account of these they wish to appease God’s wrath. 
But Christ clearly says, Matt. 15:9: In vain do they worship Me, teaching for doc-
trines the commandments of men.
6] We have above discussed at length that men are justified by faith when they 
believe that they have a reconciled God, not because of our works, but gratuitously, 
for Christ’s sake. It is certain that this is the doctrine of the Gospel, because Paul 
clearly teaches, Eph. 2:8, 9: By grace are ye saved, through faith; and that not of 
yourselves: it is the gift of God; 7] not of works. Now these men say that men merit 
the remission of sins by these human observances. What else is this than to appoint 
another justifier, a mediator other than Christ? 8] Paul says to the Galatians 5:4: 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
183
Christ has become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the 
Law; i.e., if you hold that by the observance of the Law you merit to be accounted 
righteous before God, Christ will profit you nothing; for what need of Christ have 
those who hold that they are righteous by their own observance 9] of the Law? God 
has set forth Christ with the promise that on account of this Mediator, and not on 
account of our righteousness, He wishes to be propitious to us. But these men hold 
that God is reconciled and propitious because of the traditions, and not because of 
Christ. Therefore they take away from Christ the honor of Mediator. 10] Neither, 
so far as this matter is concerned, is there any difference between our traditions 
and the ceremonies of Moses. Paul condemns the ceremonies of Moses, just as he 
condemns traditions, for the reason that they were regarded as works which merit 
righteousness before God. Thus the office of Christ and the righteousness of faith 
were obscured. Therefore, the Law being removed, and traditions being removed, 
he contends that the remission of sins has been promised not because of our works, 
but freely, because of Christ, if only by faith we receive it. For the promise is not 
received 11] except by faith. Since, therefore, by faith we receive the remission of 
sins, since by faith we have a propitious God for Christ’s sake, it is an error and 
impiety to declare that because of these observances we merit the remission of sins. 
12] If any one should say here that we do not merit the remission of sins, but that 
those who have already been justified by these traditions merit grace, Paul again 
replies, Gal. 2:17, that Christ would be the minister of sin if after justification we 
must hold that henceforth we are not accounted righteous for Christ’s sake, but 
we ought first, by other observances, to merit that we be accounted righteous. 
Likewise Gal. 3:15: Though it be but a man’s covenant, no man addeth thereto. 
Therefore, neither to God’s covenant, who promises that for Christ’s sake He will 
be propitious to us, ought we to add that we must first through these observances 
attain such merit as to be regarded as accepted and righteous.
13] However, what need is there of a long discussion? No tradition was institut-
ed by the holy Fathers with the design that it should merit the remission of sins, 
or righteousness, but they have been instituted for the sake, of good order in the 
Church and 14] for the sake, of tranquillity. And when any one wishes to institute 
certain works to merit the remission of sins, or righteousness, how will he know 
that these works please God since he has not the testimony of God’s Word? How, 
without God’s command and Word, will he render men certain of God’s will? 
Does He not everywhere in the prophets prohibit men from instituting, without 
His commandment, peculiar rites of worship? In Ezek. 20:18, 19 it is written: Walk 
ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile 
yourselves with their idols: I am the Lord, your God. Walk in My statutes, and keep 
My judgments, and do them. 15] If men are allowed to institute religious rites, and 
through these rites merit grace, the religious rites of all the heathen will have to be 
The Lutheran Confessions
184
approved, and the rites instituted by Jeroboam, 1 Kings 12:26f, and by others, out-
side of the Law, will have to be approved. For what, difference does it make? If we 
have been allowed to institute religious rites that are profitable for meriting grace, 
or righteousness, why was the same not allowed the heathen and the Israelites? 16] 
But the religious rites of the heathen and the Israelites were rejected for the very 
reason that they held that by these they merited remission of sins and righteous-
ness, and yet 17] did not know [the highest service of God] the righteousness of 
faith. Lastly, whence are we rendered certain that rites instituted by men without 
God’s command justify, inasmuch as nothing can be affirmed of God’s will without 
God’s Word? What if God does not approve these services? How, therefore, do 
the adversaries affirm that they justify? Without God’s Word and testimony this 
cannot be affirmed. And Paul says, Rom. 14:23: Whatsoever is not of faith is sin. But 
as these services have no testimony of God’s Word, conscience must doubt as to 
whether they please God.
18] And what need is there of words on a subject so manifest? If the adversaries 
defend these human services as meriting justification, grace, and the remission of 
sins, they simply establish the kingdom of Antichrist. For the kingdom of Anti-
christ is a new service of God, devised by human authority rejecting Christ, just 
as the kingdom of Mahomet has services and works through which it wishes to be 
justified before God; nor does it hold that men are gratuitously justified before 
God by faith, for Christ’s sake. Thus the Papacy also will be a part of the kingdom 
of Antichrist if it thus defends human services as justifying. For the honor is taken 
away from Christ when they teach that we are not justified gratuitously by faith, 
for Christ’s sake, but by such services; especially when they teach that such services 
are not only useful for justification, but are also necessary, as they hold above in 
Art. VII, where they condemn us for saying that unto true unity of the Church it is 
not necessary that rites instituted by men should everywhere be alike. 
19] Daniel 11:38, indicates that new human services will be the very form and con-
stitution of the kingdom of Antichrist. For he says thus: But in his estate shall he 
honor the god of forces; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with 
gold and silver and precious stones. Here he describes new services, because he says 
that such a god shall be worshiped as 20] the fathers were ignorant of. For although 
the holy Fathers themselves had both rites and traditions, yet they did not hold 
that these matters are useful or necessary for justification; they did not obscure 
the glory and office of Christ, but taught that we are justified by faith for Christ’s 
sake, and not for the sake of these human services. But they observed human rites 
for the sake of bodily advantage, that the people might know at what time they 
should assemble; that, for the sake of example all things in the churches might be 
done in order and becomingly; lastly, that the common people might receive a sort 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
185
of training. For the distinctions of times and the variety of rites are of service in 
admonishing the common people. 21] The Fathers had these reasons for maintain-
ing the rites, and for these reasons we also judge it to he right that traditions [good 
customs] be maintained. And we are greatly surprised that the adversaries [con-
trary to the entire Scriptures of the Apostles, contrary to the Old and New Testa-
ments] contend for another design of traditions, namely, that they may merit the 
remission of sins, grace, or justification. What else is this than to honor God with 
gold and silver and precious stones [as Daniel says], i.e., to hold that God becomes 
reconciled by a variety in clothing, ornaments, and by similar rites [many kinds of 
church decorations, banners, tapers], as are infinite in human traditions?
22] Paul writes to the Colossians 2:23, that traditions have a show of wisdom. And 
they indeed have. For this good order is very becoming in the Church, and for this 
reason is necessary. But human reason, because it does not understand the righ-
teousness of faith, naturally imagines that such works justify men because 23] they 
reconcile God, etc. Thus the common people among the Israelites thought, and by 
this opinion increased such ceremonies, just as among us they have grown in the 
monasteries [as in our time one altar after another and one church after another is 
founded]. 24] Thus human reason judges also of bodily exercises, of fasts; although 
the end of these is to restrain the flesh, reason falsely adds that they are services 
which justify. As Thomas writes: Fasting avails for the extinguishing and the 
prevention of guilt. These are the words of Thomas. Thus the semblance of wisdom 
and righteousness in such works deceives men. And the examples of the saints are 
added [when they say: St. Francis wore a cap, etc.]; and when men desire to imitate 
these, they imitate, for the most part, the outward exercises; their faith they do not 
imitate.
25] After this semblance of wisdom and righteousness has deceived men, then 
infinite evils follow; the Gospel concerning the righteousness of faith in Christ is 
obscured, and vain confidence in such works succeeds. Then the commandments 
of God are obscured; these works arrogate to themselves the title of a perfect and 
spiritual life, and are far preferred to the works of God’s commandments [the 
true, holy, good works], as, the works of one’s own calling, the administration of 
the state, the management of a family, married life, the bringing up of children. 
26] Compared with those ceremonies, the latter are judged to be profane, so that 
they are exercised by many with some doubt of conscience. For it is known that 
many have abandoned the administration of the state and married life, in order to 
embrace these observances as better and holier [have gone into cloisters in order to 
become holy and spiritual].
The Lutheran Confessions
186
27] Nor is this enough. When the persuasion has taken possession of minds that 
such observances are necessary to justification, consciences are in miserable anxiety 
because they cannot exactly fulfil all observances. For how many are there who 
could enumerate all these observances? There are immense books, yea, whole 
libraries, containing not a syllable concerning Christ, concerning faith in Christ, 
concerning the good works of one’s own calling, but which only collect the tradi-
tions and interpretations by which they are sometimes rendered quite rigorous and 
28] sometimes relaxed. [They write of such precepts as of fasting for forty days, the 
four canonical hours for prayer, etc.] How that most excellent man, Gerson, is tor-
tured while he searches for the grades and extent of the precepts! Nevertheless, he 
is not able to fix ejpieivkeian [mitigation] in a definite grade [and yet cannot find 
any sure grade where he could confidently promise the heart assurance and peace]. 
Meanwhile, he deeply deplores the dangers to godly consciences which this rigid 
interpretation of the traditions produces.
29] Against this semblance of wisdom and righteousness in human rites, which 
deceives men, let us therefore fortify ourselves by the Word of God, and let us 
know, first of all, that these neither merit before God the remission of sins or 
justification, nor are necessary for justification. 30] We have above cited some 
testimonies. And Paul is full of them. To the Colossians 2:16, 17, he clearly says: Let 
no man, therefore, judge you in meat or in drink, or in respect of an holy-day, or 
of the new moon, or of the Sabbath-days, which are a shadow of things to come; 
but the body is of Christ. Here now he embraces at the same time both the Law 
of Moses and human traditions, in order that the adversaries may not elude these 
testimonies, according to their custom, upon the ground that Paul is speaking 
only of the Law of Moses. But he clearly testifies here that he is speaking of human 
traditions. However, the adversaries do not see what they are saying; if the Gospel 
says that the ceremonies of Moses, which were divinely instituted, do not justify, 
how much less do human traditions justify!
31] Neither have the bishops the power to institute services, as though they 
justified, or were necessary for justification. Yea, the apostles, Acts 15:10, say: Why 
tempt ye God to put a yoke, etc., where Peter declares this purpose to burden 
the Church a great sin. And Paul forbids the Galatians 5:1, 32] to be entangled 
again with the yoke of bondage. Therefore, it is the will of the apostles that this 
liberty remain in the Church, that no services of the Law or of traditions be 
judged as necessary (just as in the Law ceremonies were for a time necessary), 
lest the righteousness of faith be obscured, if men judge that these services merit 
justification, or are necessary for justification. 33] Many seek in traditions various 
ejpieikeiva [mitigations] in order to heal consciences; and yet they do not find any 
sure grades by which to free consciences from these chains. 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession

34] But just as Alexander once for all solved the Gordian knot by cutting it 
with his sword when he could not disentangle it, so the apostles once for all free 
consciences from traditions, especially if they are taught to merit justification. 
The apostles compel us to oppose this doctrine by teaching and examples. They 
compel us to teach that traditions do not justify; that they are not necessary for 
justification; that no one ought 35] to frame or receive traditions with the opinion 
that they merit justification. Then, even though any one should observe them, let 
him observe them without superstition as civil customs, just as without supersti-
tion soldiers are clothed in one way 36] and scholars in another [as I regard my 
wearing of a German costume among the Germans and a French costume among 
the French as an observance of the usage of the land, and not for the purpose of 
being saved thereby]. The apostles violate traditions and are excused by Christ; for 
the example was to be shown the Pharisees that these 37] services are unprofitable. 
And if our people neglect some traditions that are of little advantage, they are now 
sufficiently excused, when these are required as though they merit justification. For 
such an opinion with regard to traditions is impious [an error not to be endured].
38] But we cheerfully maintain the old traditions [as, the three high festivals, the 
observance of Sunday, and the like] made in the Church for the sake of usefulness 
and tranquillity; and we interpret them in a more moderate way, 39] to the exclu-
sion of the opinion which holds that they justify. And our enemies falsely accuse us 
of abolishing good ordinances and church-discipline. For we can truly declare that 
the public form of the churches is more becoming with us than with the adversar-
ies (that the true worship of God is observed in our churches in a more Christian, 
honorable way]. And if any one will consider it aright, we conform to the canons 
more truly than do the adversaries. [For the adversaries, without shame, tread un-
der foot the most honorable canons, just as they do Christ and the Gospel.]
40] With the adversaries, unwilling celebrants, and those hired for pay, and very 
frequently only for pay, celebrate the Masses. They sing psalms, not that they may 
learn or pray [for the greater part do not understand a verse in the psalms], but for 
the sake of the service, as though this work were a service, or, at least, for the sake 
of reward. [All this they cannot deny. Some who are upright among them are even 
ashamed of this traffic, and declare that the clergy is in need of reformation.] With 
us many use the Lord’s Supper [willingly and without constraint] every Lord’s Day, 
but after having been first instructed, examined [whether they know and under-
stand anything of the Lord’s Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments], and 
absolved. The children sing psalms in order that they may learn [become familiar 
with passages of Scripture]; the people also sing [Latin and German psalms], in 
order that they may either learn or pray. With 41] the adversaries there is no cat-
echization of the children whatever, concerning which even the canons give com-
The Lutheran Confessions
188
mands. With us the pastors and ministers of the churches are compelled publicly 
[and privately] to instruct and hear the youth; and this ceremony produces the best 
fruits. [And the Catechism is not a mere childish thing, as is the bearing of banners 
and tapers, but a very profitable instruction.] 
42] Among the adversaries, in many regions [as in Italy and Spain], during the 
entire year no sermons are delivered, except in Lent. [Here they ought to cry out 
and justly make grievous complaint; for this means at one blow to overthrow 
completely all worship. For of all acts of worship that is the greatest, most holy, 
most necessary, and highest, which God has required as the highest in the First and 
the Second Commandment, namely, to preach the Word of God. For the ministry 
is the highest office in the Church. Now, if this worship is omitted, how can there 
be knowledge of God, the doctrine of Christ, or the Gospel?] But the chief service 
of God is to teach the Gospel. And when the adversaries do preach, they speak 
of human traditions, of the worship of saints [of consecrated water], and similar 
trifles, which the people justly loathe; therefore they are deserted immediately in 
the beginning, after the text of the Gospel has been recited. [This practise may have 
started because the people did not wish to hear the other lies.] A few better ones 
begin now to speak of good works; but of the righteousness of faith, of faith in 
Christ, of the consolation of consciences, they say nothing; yea, this most whole-
some part of the Gospel they rail at with their reproaches. [This blessed doctrine, 
the precious holy Gospel, they call Lutheran.] 
43] On the contrary, in our churches all the sermons are occupied with such topics 
as these: of repentance; of the fear of God; of faith in Christ, of the righteousness 
of faith, of the consolation of consciences by faith, of the exercises of faith; of 
prayer, what its nature should be, and that we should be fully confident that it is 
efficacious, that it is heard; of the cross; of the authority of magistrates and all civil 
ordinances [likewise, how each one in his station should live in a Christian manner, 
and, out of obedience to the command of the Lord God, should conduct himself 
in reference to every worldly ordinance and law]; of the distinction between the 
kingdom of Christ, or the spiritual kingdom, and political affairs; of marriage; of 
the education and instruction of children; of chastity; of all the offices of love. 44] 
From this condition of the churches it may be judged that we diligently maintain 
church discipline and godly ceremonies and good church-customs.
45] And of the mortification of the flesh and discipline of the body we thus teach, 
just as the Confession states, that a true and not a feigned mortification occurs 
through the cross and afflictions by which God exercises us (when God breaks 
our will, inflicts the cross and trouble]. In these we must obey God’s will, as Paul 
says, Rom. 12:1: Present your bodies a living sacrifice. And these are the spiritual 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
189
exercises of fear and faith. 46] But in addition to this mortification which occurs 
through the cross [which does not depend upon our will] there is also a voluntary 
kind of exercise necessary, of which Christ says, Luke 21:34: Take heed to yourselves 
lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting. And Paul, 1 Cor. 9:27: I 
keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, etc. 47] And these exercises are 
to be undertaken not because they are services that justify, but in order to curb the 
flesh, lest satiety may overpower us, and render us secure and indifferent, the result 
of which is that men indulge and obey the dispositions of the flesh. This diligence 
ought to be perpetual, 48] because it has the perpetual command of God. And this 
prescribed form of certain meats and times does nothing [as experience shows] 
towards curbing the flesh. For it is more luxurious and sumptuous than other feasts 
[for they were at greater expense, and practised greater gluttony with fish and 
various Lenten meats than when the fasts were not observed], and not even the 
adversaries observe the form given in the canons.
49] This topic concerning traditions contains many and difficult questions of 
controversy, and we have actually experienced that traditions are truly snares of 
consciences. When they are exacted as necessary, they torture in wonderful ways 
the conscience omitting any observance [as godly hearts, indeed, experience when 
in the canonical hours they have omitted a compline, or offended against them in 
a similar way]. Again their abrogation has its own evils and its own 50] questions. 
[On the other hand, to teach absolute freedom has also its doubts and questions, 
because the common people need outward discipline and instruction.] But we 
have an easy and plain case, because the adversaries condemn us for teaching 
that human traditions do not merit the remission of sins. Likewise they require 
universal traditions, as they call them, as necessary for justification [and place them 
in Christ’s stead]. Here we have Paul as a constant champion, who everywhere 
contends that these observances neither justify nor are necessary in addition to the 
righteousness of faith. 51] And nevertheless we teach that in these matters the use 
of liberty is to be so controlled that the inexperienced may not be offended, and, 
on account of the abuse of liberty, may not become more hostile to the true doc-
trine of the Gospel, or that without a reasonable cause nothing in customary rites 
be changed, but that, in order to cherish harmony, such old customs be observed 
as can be observed without sin or without great inconvenience. 52] And in this 
very assembly we have shown sufficiently that for love’s sake we do not refuse to 
observe adiaphora with others, even though they should have some disadvantage; 
but we have judged that such public harmony as could indeed be produced without 
offense to consciences ought to be preferred to all other advantages [all other less 
important matters]. But concerning this entire subject we shall speak after a while, 
when we shall treat of vows and ecclesiastical power.

Article XVI: Of Political Order.
53] The Sixteenth Article the adversaries receive without any exception, in which 
we have confessed that it is lawful for the Christian to bear civil office, sit in judg-
ment, determine matters by the imperial laws, and other laws in present force, ap-
point just punishments, engage in just wars, act as a soldier, make legal contracts, 
hold property, take an oath, when magistrates require it, contract marriage; finally, 
that legitimate civil ordinances are good creatures of God and divine ordinances, 
which a Christian can use with safety. 54] This entire topic concerning the distinction 
between the kingdom of Christ and a political kingdomhas been explained to advantage 
[to the remarkably great consolation of many consciences] in the literature of our 
writers, [namely] that the kingdom of Christ is spiritual [inasmuch as Christ gov-
erns by the Word and by preaching], to wit, beginning in the heart the knowledge 
of God, the fear of God and faith, eternal righteousness, and eternal life; mean-
while it permits us outwardly to use legitimate political ordinances of every nation 
in which we live, just as it permits us to use medicine or 55] the art of building, or 
food, drink, air. Neither does the Gospel bring new laws concerning the civil state, 
but commands that we obey present laws, whether they have been framed by hea-
then or by others, and that in this obedience we should exercise love. For Carlstadt 
was insane in imposing upon us the judicial laws of Moses. 56] Concerning these 
subjects, our theologians have written more fully, because the monks diffused many 
pernicious opinions in the Church. They called a community of property the polity 
of the Gospel; they said that not to hold property, not to vindicate one’s self at 
law [not to have wife and child], were evangelical counsels. These opinions greatly 
obscure the Gospel and the spiritual kingdom [so that it was not understood at all 
what the Christian or spiritual kingdom of Christ is; they concocted the secular 
kingdom with the spiritual, whence much trouble and seditions, harmful teaching 
resulted], and are dangerous to the commonwealth. 57] For the Gospel does not 
destroy the State or the family [buying, selling, and other civil regulations], but 
much rather approves them, and bids us obey them as a divine ordinance, not only 
on account of punishment, but also on account of conscience.
58] Julian the Apostate, Celsus, and very many others made the objection to 
Christians that the Gospel would rend asunder states, because it prohibited legal 
redress, and taught certain other things not at all suited to political association. 
And these questions wonderfully exercised Origen, Nazianzen, and others, 
although, indeed, they can be most readily explained, if we keep in mind the fact 
that the Gospel does not introduce laws concerning the civil state, but is the 
remission of sins and the beginning of a new life in the hearts of believers; besides, 
it not only approves outward governments, but subjects us to them, Rom. 13:1, 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
191
just as we have been necessarily placed under the laws of seasons, the changes 
of winter and summer, as divine ordinances. [This is no obstacle to the spiritual 
kingdom.] 59] The Gospel forbids private redress [in order that no one should 
interfere with the office of the magistrate], and Christ inculcates this so frequent-
ly with the design that the apostles should not think that they ought to seize the 
governments from those who held otherwise, just as the Jews dreamed concern-
ing the kingdom of the Messiah, but that they might know they ought to teach 
concerning the spiritual kingdom that it does not change the civil state. Therefore 
private redress is prohibited not by advice, but by a command, Matt. 5:39; Rom. 
12:19. Public redress, which is made through the office of the magistrate, is not 
advised against, but is commanded, and is a work of God, according to Paul, Rom. 
13:1 sqq. Now the different kinds of public redress are legal decisions, 60] capital 
punishment, wars, military service. It is manifest how incorrectly many writers 
have judged concerning these matters [some teachers have taught such pernicious 
errors that nearly all princes, lords, knights, servants regarded their proper estate 
as secular, ungodly, and damnable, etc. Nor can it be fully expressed in words what 
an unspeakable peril and damage has resulted from this to souls and consciences], 
because they were in the error that the Gospel is an external, new, and monastic 
form of government, and did not see that the Gospel brings eternal righteousness 
to hearts [teaches how a person is redeemed, before God and in his conscience, 
from sin, hell, and the devil], while it outwardly approves the civil state.
61] It is also a most vain delusion that it is Christian perfection not to hold 
property. For Christian perfection consists not in the contempt of civil ordinances, 
but in dispositions of the heart, in great fear of God, in great faith, just as 
Abraham, David, Daniel, even in great wealth and while exercising civil power, 
were no less 62] perfect than any hermits. But the monks [especially the Barefoot 
monks] have spread this outward hypocrisy before the eyes of men, so that it could 
not be seen in what things true perfection exists. With what praises have they 
brought forward this communion of property, as though it were 63] evangelical! 
But these praises have the greatest danger, especially since they differ much from 
the Scriptures. For Scripture does not command that property be common, but 
the Law of the Decalog, when it says, Ex. 20:15: Thou shalt not steal, distinguish-
es rights of ownership, and commands each one to hold what is his own. Wyclif 
manifestly was raging when he said that priests were not allowed to hold property. 
64] There are infinite discussions concerning contracts, in reference to which good 
consciences can never be satisfied unless they know the rule that it is lawful for a 
Christian to make use of civil ordinances and laws. This rule protects consciences 
when it teaches that contracts are lawful before God just to the extent that the 
magistrates or laws approve them.
The Lutheran Confessions
192
65] This entire topic concerning civil affairs has been so clearly set forth by our 
theologians that very many good men occupied in the state and in business have 
declared that they have been greatly benefited, who before, troubled by the opin-
ion of the monks, were in doubt as to whether the Gospel allowed these civil offic-
es and business. Accordingly, we have recounted these things in order that those 
without also may understand that by the kind of doctrine which we follow, the 
authority of magistrates and the dignity of all civil ordinances are not undermined, 
but are all the more strengthened [and that it is only this doctrine which gives true 
instruction as to how eminently glorious an office, full of good Christian works, 
the office of rulers is]. The importance of these matters was greatly obscured previ-
ously by those silly monastic opinions, which far preferred the hypocrisy of poverty 
and humility to the state and the family, although these have God’s command, 
while this Platonic communion [monasticism] has not God’s command.
Article XVII: Of Christ’s Return to Judgment.
66] The Seventeenth Article the adversaries receive without exception, in which we 
confess that at the consummation of the world Christ shall appear, and shall raise 
up all the dead, and shall give to the godly eternal life and, eternal joys, but shall 
condemn the ungodly to be punished with the devil without end.
Article XVIII: Of Free Will.
67] The Eighteenth Article, Of Free Will, the adversaries receive, although they add 
some testimonies not at all adapted to this case. They add also a declamation that 
neither, with the Pelagians, is too much to be granted to the free will, nor, with the 
Manicheans, is all freedom to be denied it. 68] Very well; but what difference is 
there between the Pelagians and our adversaries, since both hold that without the 
Holy Ghost men can love God and perform God’s commandments with respect to 
the substance of the acts, and can merit grace and justification by works which rea-
son performs by itself, without the Holy Ghost? 69] How many absurdities follow 
from these Pelagian opinions, which are taught with great authority in the schools! 
These Augustine, following Paul, refutes with great emphasis, whose judgment we 
have recounted above in the article Of Justification. (see AP IV 1 and AP IV 106) 
70] Nor, indeed, do we deny liberty to the human will. The human will has liberty 
in the choice of works and things which reason comprehends by itself. It can to 
a certain extent render civil righteousness or the righteousness of works; it can 
speak of God, offer to God a certain service by an outward work, obey magistrates, 
parents; in the choice of an outward work it can restrain the hands from murder, 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
193
from adultery, from theft. Since there is left in human nature reason and judgment 
concerning objects subjected to the senses, choice between these things, and the 
liberty and power to render civil righteousness, are also left. For Scripture calls this 
the righteousness of the flesh which the carnal nature, i.e., reason, renders by itself, 
71] without the Holy Ghost. Although the power of concupiscence is such that 
men more frequently obey evil dispositions than sound judgment. And the devil, 
who is efficacious in the godless, as Paul says, Eph. 2:2, does not cease to incite this 
feeble nature to various offenses. These are the reasons why even civil righteousness 
is rare among men, as we see that not even the philosophers themselves, who seem 
72] to have aspired after this righteousness, attained it. But it is false to say that he 
who performs the works of the commandments without grace does not sin. And 
they add further that such works also merit de congruo the remission of sins and 
justification. For human hearts without the Holy Ghost are without the fear of 
God; without trust toward God, they do not believe that they are heard, forgiven, 
helped, and preserved by God. Therefore they are godless. For neither can a corrupt 
tree bring forth good fruit, Matt. 7:18. And without faith it is impossible to please 
God, Heb. 11:6.
73] Therefore, although we concede to free will the liberty and power to perform 
the outward works of the Law, yet we do not ascribe to free will these spiritual 
matters, namely, truly to fear God, truly to believe God, truly to be confident and 
hold that God regards us, hears us, forgives us, etc. These are the true works of the 
First Table, which the heart cannot render without the Holy Ghost, as Paul says, 1 
Cor. 2:14: The natural man, i.e., man using only natural strength, receiveth not the 
things 74] of the Spirit of God. (That is, a person who is not enlightened by the 
Spirit of God does not, by his natural reason, receive anything of God’s will and 
divine matters.] And this can be decided if men consider what their hearts believe 
concerning God’s will, whether they are truly confident that they are regarded and 
heard by God. Even for saints to retain this faith [and, as Peter says (1 Pet. 1:8), to 
risk and commit himself entirely to God, whom he does not see, to love Christ, 
and esteem Him highly, whom he does not see] is difficult, so far is it from existing 
in the godless. But it is conceived, as we have said above, when terrified hearts hear 
the Gospel and receive consolation [when we are born anew of the Holy Ghost].
75] Therefore such a distribution is of advantage in which civil righteousness is 
ascribed to the free will and spiritual righteousness to the governing of the Holy 
Ghost in the regenerate. For thus the outward discipline is retained, because all 
men ought to know equally, both that God requires this civil righteousness [God 
will not tolerate indecent, wild, reckless conduct], and that, in a measure, we can 
afford it. And yet a distinction is shown between human and spiritual righteous-
ness, between philosophical doctrine and the doctrine of the Holy Ghost, and 
The Lutheran Confessions
194
it can be understood for what there is need of the Holy Ghost. 76] Nor has this 
distribution been invented by us, but Scripture most clearly teaches it. Augustine 
also treats of it, and recently it has been well treated of by William of Paris, but it 
has been wickedly suppressed by those who have dreamt that men can obey God’s 
Law without the Holy Ghost, but that the Holy Ghost is given in order that, in 
addition, it may be considered meritorious.
Article XIX: Of the Cause of Sin.
77] The Nineteenth Article the adversaries receive, in which we confess that, 
although God only and alone has framed all nature, and preserves all things which 
exist, yet (He is not the cause of sin, but] the cause of sin is the will in the devil and 
men turning itself away from God, according to the saying of Christ concerning 
the devil, John 8:44: When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own.
Article XX: Of Good Works.
78] In the Twentieth Article they distinctly lay down these words, namely, that 
they reject and condemn our statement that men do not merit the remission of 
sins by good works. [Mark this well!] They clearly declare that they reject and 
condemn this article. What is to be said on a subject so manifest? 79] Here the 
framers of the Confutation openly show by what spirit they are led. For what in 
the Church is more certain than that the remission of sins occurs freely for Christ’s 
sake, that Christ, and not our works, is the propitiation for sins, as Peter says, Acts 
10:43: To Him give all the prophets witness that through His name, whosoever 
believeth on Him, shall receive remission of sins? [This strong testimony of all the 
holy prophets may duly be called a decree of the catholic Christian Church. For 
even a single prophet is very highly esteemed by God and a treasure worth the 
whole world.] To this Church of the prophets we would rather assent than to these 
abandoned writers of the Confutation, who so impudently blaspheme Christ. 80] 
For although there were writers who held that after the remission of sins men are 
just before God, not by faith, but by works themselves, yet they did not hold this, 
namely, that the remission of sins itself occurs on account of our works, and not 
freely for Christ’s sake.
81] Therefore the blasphemy of ascribing Christ’s honor to our works is not to be 
endured. These theologians are now entirely without shame if they dare to bring 
such an opinion into the Church. Nor do we doubt that His Most Excellent Impe-
rial Majesty and very many of the princes would not have allowed this passage to 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
195
remain in the Confutation if they had been admonished of it. 82] Here we could 
cite infinite testimonies from Scripture and from the Fathers [that this article is 
certainly divine and true, and this is the sacred and divine truth. For there is hardly 
a syllable, hardly a leaf in the Bible, in the principal books of the Holy Scriptures, 
where this is not clearly stated.] But also above we have said enough on this subject. 
And there is no need of more testimonies for one who knows why Christ has been 
given to us, who knows that Christ is the propitiation for our sins. [God-fearing, 
pious hearts that know well why Christ has been given, who for all the possessions 
and kingdoms of the world would not be without Christ as our only Treasure, our 
only Mediator and Redeemer, must here be shocked and terrified that God’s holy 
Word and Truth should be so openly despised and condemned by poor men.] Isaiah 
says, 53:6: The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquities of us all. The adversaries, on 
the other hand, [accuse Isaiah and the entire Bible of lying and] teach that God lays 
our iniquities not on Christ, but on our [beggarly] works. Neither are we disposed 
to mention here the sort of works [rosaries, pilgrimages, and the like] which they 
teach. 83] We see that a horrible decree has been prepared against us, which would 
terrify us still more if we were contending concerning doubtful or trifling subjects. 
Now, since our consciences understand that by the adversaries the manifest truth 
is condemned, whose defense is necessary for the Church and increases the glory of 
Christ, we easily despise the terrors of the world, and with a strong spirit will bear 
whatever is to be suffered for the glory of Christ and the advantage of the Church. 
84] Who would not rejoice to die in the confession of such articles as that we ob-
tain the remission of sins by faith freely for Christ’s sake, that we do not merit the 
remission of sins by our works? 
85] [Experience shows — and the monks themselves must admit it — that] The 
consciences of the pious will have no sufficiently sure consolation against the 
terrors of sin and of death, and against the devil soliciting to despair [and who in a 
moment blows away all our works like dust], if they do not know that they ought 
to be confident that they have the remission of sins freely for Christ’s sake. This 
faith sustains and quickens hearts in that most violent conflict with despair [in the 
great agony of death, in the great anguish, when no creature can help, yea, when 
we must depart from this entire visible creation into another state and world, and 
must die].
86] Therefore the cause is one which is worthy that for its sake we should refuse no 
danger. Whosoever you are that has assented to our Confession, “do not yield to 
the wicked, but, on the contrary, go forward the more boldly,” when the adversaries 
endeavor, by means of terrors and tortures and punishments, to drive away from 
you that consolation which has been tendered to the entire Church in this article 
of ours [but with all cheerfulness rely confidently and gladly on God and the Lord 
The Lutheran Confessions
196
Jesus, and joyfully confess this manifest truth in opposition to the tyranny, wrath, 
threatening, and terrors of all the world, yea, in opposition to the daily murders 
and persecution, of tyrants. For who would suffer to have taken from him this 
great, yea, everlasting consolation on which the entire salvation of the whole Chris-
tian Church depends? Anyone who picks up the Bible and reads it earnestly will 
soon observe that this doctrine has its foundation everywhere in the Bible].
87] Testimonies of Scripture will not be wanting to one seeking them, which 
will establish his mind. For Paul at the top of his voice, as the saying is, cries out, 
Rom. 3:24f., and 4:16, that sins are freely remitted for Christ’s sake. It is of faith, 
he says, that it might be by grace, to the end the promise might be sure. That is, if 
the promise would depend upon our works, it would not be sure. If remission of 
sins would be given on account of our works, when would we know that we had 
obtained it, when would a terrified conscience find a work which it would consider 
sufficient to appease God’s wrath? 88] But we spoke of the entire matter above. 
Thence let the reader derive testimonies. For the unworthy treatment of the sub-
ject has forced from us the present, not discussion, but complaint that on this topic 
they have distinctly recorded themselves as disapproving of this article of ours, that 
we obtain remission of sins not on account of our works, but by faith and freely on 
account of Christ.
89] The adversaries also add testimonies to their own condemnation, and it is 
worth while to recite several of them. They quote from 2 Pet. 1:10: Give diligence 
to make your calling sure, etc. Now you see, reader, that our adversaries have not 
wasted labor in learning logic, but have the art of inferring from the Scriptures 
whatever pleases them [whether it is in harmony with the Scriptures or out of 
harmony; whether it is correctly or incorrectly concluded. For they conclude thus:] 
“Make your calling sure by good works.” Therefore works merit the remission of 
sins. A very agreeable mode of reasoning, if one would argue thus concerning a 
person sentenced to capital punishment, whose punishment has been remitted: 
“The magistrate commands that hereafter you abstain from that which belongs to 
another. Therefore you have merited the remission of the penalty, because you are 
now abstaining from what belongs to another.” 90] Thus to argue is to make a cause 
out of that which is not a cause. For Peter speaks of works following the remission 
of sins, and teaches why they should be done, namely, that the calling may be sure, 
i.e., lest they may fall from their calling if they sin again. Do good works that you 
may persevere in your calling, that you [do not fall away again, grow cold and] may 
not lose the gifts of your calling, which were given you before, and not on account 
of works that follow, and which now are retained by faith; for faith does not 
remain in those who lose the Holy Ghost, who reject repentance, just as we have 
said above (253:1) that faith exists in repentance.
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
197
91] They add other testimonies cohering no better. Lastly they say that this 
opinion was condemned a thousand years before, in the time of Augustine. This 
also is quite false. For the Church of Christ always held that the remission of sins 
is obtained freely. Yea, the Pelagians were condemned, who contended that grace 
is given on account of our works. 92] Besides, we have above shown sufficiently 
that we hold that good works ought necessarily to follow faith. For we do not make 
void the Law, says Paul, Rom. 3:31; yea, we establish the Law, because when by faith 
we have received the Holy Ghost, the fulfilling of the Law necessarily follows, by 
which love, patience, chastity, and other fruits of the Spirit gradually grow.
Article XXI (IX): Of the Invocation of Saints.
1] The Twenty-first Article they absolutely condemn, because we do not require the 
invocation of saints. Nor on any topic do they speak more eloquently and with more 
prolixity. Nevertheless they do not effect anything else than that the saints should 
be honored; likewise, that the saints who live pray for others; as though, indeed, 
the invocation of dead saints were on that account necessary. 2] They cite Cyprian, 
because he asked Cornelius while yet alive to pray for his brothers when departing. 
By this example they prove the invocation of the dead. They quote also Jerome 
against Vigilantius. “On this field” [in this matter], they say, “eleven hundred years 
ago, Jerome overcame Vigilantius.” Thus the adversaries triumph, as though the 
war were already ended. Nor do those asses see that in Jerome, against Vigilantius, 
there is not a syllable concerning invocation. He speaks concerning honors for the 
saints, not concerning invocation. 3] Neither have the rest of the ancient writers 
before Gregory made mention of invocation. Certainly this invocation, with these 
opinions which the adversaries now teach concerning the application of merits, has 
not the testimonies of the ancient writers.
4] Our Confession approves honors to the saints. For here a threefold honor is to 
be approved. The first is thanksgiving. For we ought to give thanks to God because 
He has shown examples of mercy; because He has shown that He wishes to save 
men; because He has given teachers or other gifts to the Church. And these gifts, 
as they are the greatest, should be amplified, and the saints themselves should 
be praised, who have faithfully used these gifts, just as Christ praises faithful 
business-men, 5] Matt. 25:21, 23. The second service is the strengthening of our 
faith; when we see the denial forgiven Peter, we also are encouraged to believe the 
more that grace 6] truly superabounds over sin, Rom. 5:20. The third honor is the 
imitation, first, of faith, then of the other virtues, which every one should imitate 
according to his calling. 7] These true honors the adversaries do not require. They 
The Lutheran Confessions
198
dispute only concerning invocation, which, even though it would have no danger, 
nevertheless is not necessary.
8] Besides, we also grant that the angels pray for us. For there is a testimony in 
Zech. 1:12, where an angel prays: O Lord of hosts, how long wilt Thou not have mer-
cy on 9] Jerusalem? Although concerning the saints we concede that, just as, when 
alive, they pray for the Church universal in general, so in heaven they pray for the 
Church in general, albeit no testimony concerning the praying of the dead is extant 
in the Scriptures, except the dream taken from the Second Book of Maccabees, 
15:14.
Moreover, even supposing that the saints pray for the Church ever so much, 10]
yet it does not follow that they are to be invoked; although our Confession affirms 
only this, that Scripture does not teach the invocation of the saints, or that we 
are to ask the saints for aid. But since neither a command, nor a promise, nor an 
example can be produced from the Scriptures concerning the invocation of saints, 
it follows that conscience can have nothing concerning this invocation that is 
certain. And since prayer ought to be made from faith, how do we know that God 
approves this invocation? Whence do we know without the testimony of Scripture 
that the saints perceive the prayers of each one? 11] Some plainly ascribe divinity 
to the saints, namely, that they discern the silent thoughts of the minds in us. They 
dispute concerning morning and evening knowledge, perhaps because they doubt 
whether they hear us in the morning or the evening. They invent these things, not 
in order to treat the saints with honor, but to defend lucrative services. 12] Noth-
ing can be produced by the adversaries against this reasoning, that, since invoca-
tion does not have a testimony from God’s Word, it cannot be affirmed that the 
saints understand our invocation, or, even if they understand it, that God approves 
it. Therefore 13] the adversaries ought not to force us to an uncertain matter, 
because a prayer without faith is not prayer. For when they cite the example of the 
Church, it is evident that this is a new custom in the Church; for although the old 
prayers make mention of the saints, yet they do not invoke the saints. Although 
also this new invocation in the Church is dissimilar to the invocation of individu-
als.
14] Again, the adversaries not only require invocation in the worship of the saints, 
but also apply the merits of the saints to others, and make of the saints not only 
intercessors, but also propitiators. This is in no way to be endured. For here the 
honor belonging only to Christ is altogether transferred to the saints. For they 
make them mediators and propitiators, and although they make a distinction 
between mediators of intercession and mediators [the Mediator] of redemption, yet 
they plainly make of the saints mediators of redemption. 15] But even that they are 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
199
mediators of intercession they declare without the testimony of Scripture, which, 
be it said ever so reverently, nevertheless obscures Christ’s office, and transfers the 
confidence of mercy due Christ to the saints. For men imagine that Christ is more 
severe and the saints more easily appeased, and they trust rather to the mercy of 
the saints than to the mercy of Christ, and fleeing from Christ [as from a tyrant], 
they seek the saints. Thus they actually make of them mediators of redemption.
16] Therefore we shall show that they truly make of the saints, not only 
intercessors, but propitiators, i.e., mediators of redemption. Here we do not as 
yet recite the abuses of the common people [how manifest idolatry is practised at 
pilgrimages]. We are still speaking of the opinions of the Doctors. As regards the 
rest, even the inexperienced [common people] can judge.
17] In a propitiator these two things concur. In the first place, there ought to 
be a word of God from which we may certainly know that God wishes to pity, 
and hearken to, those calling upon Him through this propitiator. There is such a 
promise concerning Christ, John 16:23: Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My 
name, He will give it you. Concerning the saints there is no such promise. There-
fore consciences cannot be firmly confident that by the invocation of saints we are 
heard. This invocation, therefore, 18] is not made from faith. Then we have also 
the command to call upon Christ, according to Matt. 11:28: Come unto Me, all ye 
that labor, etc., which certainly is said also to us. And Isaiah says, 11:10: In that day 
there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign to the people; to it 
shall the Gentiles seek. And Ps. 45:12: Even the rich among the people shall entreat 
Thy favor. And Ps. 72:11,15: Yea, all kings shall fall down before Him. And shortly 
after: Prayer also shall be made for Him continually. And in John 5:23 Christ says: 
That all men should honor the Son even as they honor the Father. And Paul, 2 
Thess. 2:16-17, says, praying: Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and God, even our 
Father, ... comfort your hearts and stablish you. (All these passages refer to Christ.] 
But concerning the invocation of saints, what commandment, what example can 
the adversaries produce from the Scriptures? 19] The second matter in a propiti-
ator is, that his merits have been presented as those which make satisfaction for 
others, which are bestowed by divine imputation on others, in order that through 
these, just as by their own merits, they may be accounted righteous. As when 
any friend pays a debt for a friend, the debtor is freed by the merit of another, 
as though it were by his own. Thus the merits of Christ are bestowed upon us, in 
order that, when we believe in Him, we may be accounted righteous by our confi-
dence in Christ’s merits as though we had merits of our own.
20] And from both, namely, from the promise and the bestowment of merits, con-
fidence in mercy arises [upon both parts must a Christian prayer be founded]. Such 
The Lutheran Confessions
200
confidence in the divine promise, and likewise in the merits of Christ, ought to be 
brought forward when we pray. For we ought to be truly confident, both that for 
Christ’s sake we are heard, and that by His merits we have a reconciled Father.
21] Here the adversaries first bid us invoke the saints, although they have neither 
God’s promise, nor a command, nor an example from Scripture. And yet they cause 
greater confidence in the mercy of the saints to be conceived than in that of Christ, 
although Christ bade us come to Him 22] and not to the saints. Secondly, they ap-
ply the merits of the saints, just as the merits of Christ, to others; they bid us trust 
in the merits of the saints as though we were accounted righteous on account of 
the merits of the saints, in like manner as we are accounted righteous by the merits 
of Christ. Here we fabricate nothing. 23] In indulgences they say that they apply 
the merits of the saints [as satisfactions for our sins]. And Gabriel, the interpreter 
of the canon of the Mass, confidently declares: According to the order instituted by 
God, we should betake ourselves to the aid of the saints, in order that we may be saved by 
their merits and vows. These are the words of Gabriel. And nevertheless, in the books 
and sermons of the adversaries still more absurd things are read here and there. 
What is it to make propitiators if this is not? They are altogether made equal to 
Christ if we must trust that we are saved by their merits.
24] But where has this arrangement, to which he refers when he says that we ought 
to resort to the aid of the saints, been instituted by God? Let him produce an 
example or command from the Scriptures. Perhaps they derive this arrangement 
from the courts of kings, where friends must be employed as intercessors. But if a 
king has appointed a certain intercessor, he will not desire that cases be brought to 
him through others. Thus, since Christ has been appointed Intercessor and High 
Priest, why do we seek others? [What can the adversaries say in reply to this?]
25] Here and there this form of absolution is used: The passion of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, the merits of the most blessed Virgin Mary and of all the saints, be to thee for the 
remission of sins. Here the absolution is pronounced on the supposition that we are 
reconciled and accounted righteous not only by the merits of Christ, but also by 
the merits of the other saints. 26] Some of us have seen a doctor of theology dying, 
for consoling whom a certain theologian, a monk, was employed. He pressed on the 
dying man nothing but this prayer: Mother of grace, protect us from the enemy; receive 
us in the hour of death.
27] Granting that the blessed Mary prays for the Church, does she receive souls in 
death, does she conquer death [the great power of Satan], does she quicken? What 
does Christ do if the blessed Mary does these things? Although she is most worthy 
of the most ample honors, nevertheless she does not wish to be made equal to 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
201
Christ, but rather wishes us to consider and follow her example [the example of her 
faith and her humility]. 28] But the subject itself declares that in public opinion 
the blessed Virgin has succeeded altogether to the place of Christ. Men have 
invoked her, have trusted in her mercy, through her have desired to appease Christ, 
as though He were not a Propitiator, but, only a dreadful judge and avenger. 
29] We believe, however, that we must not trust that the merits of the saints are 
applied to us, that on account of these God is reconcile d to us, or accounts us just, 
or saves us. For we obtain remission of sins only by the merits of Christ, when we 
believe in Him. Of the other saints it has been said, 1 Cor. 3:8: Every man shall re-
ceive his own reward according to his own labor, i.e., they cannot mutually bestow 
their own merits, the one upon the other, as the monks sell the merits of their 
orders. 30] Even Hilary says of the foolish virgins: And as the foolish virgins could not 
go forth with their lamps extinguished, they besought those who were prudent to lend them 
oil; to whom they replied that they could not give it because peradventure there might not 
be enough for all; i.e., no one can be aided by the works and merits of another, because it is 
necessary for every one to buy oil for his own lamp. [Here he points out that none of us 
can aid another by other people’s works or merits.]
31] Since, therefore, the adversaries teach us to place confidence in the invocation 
of saints, although they have neither the Word of God nor the example of Scripture 
[of the Old or of the New Testament]; since they apply the merits of the saints on 
behalf of others, not otherwise than they apply the merits of Christ, and trans-
fer the honor belonging only to Christ to the saints, we can receive neither their 
opinions concerning the worship of the saints, nor the practise of invocation. For 
we know that confidence is to be placed in the intercession of Christ, because this 
alone has God’s promise. We know that the merits of Christ alone are a propitia-
tion for us. On account of the merits of Christ we are accounted righteous when 
we believe in Him, as the text says, Rom. 9:33(cf. 1 Pet. 2:6 and Is. 28:16): Whosoever 
believeth on Him shall not be confounded. Neither are we to trust that we are 
accounted righteous by the merits of the blessed Virgin or of the other saints.
32] With the learned this error also prevails, namely, that to each saint a particu-
lar administration has been committed, that Anna bestows riches [protects from 
poverty], Sebastian keeps off pestilence, Valentine heals epilepsy, George protects 
horsemen. These opinions have clearly sprung from heathen examples. For thus, 
among the Romans, Juno was thought to enrich, Febris to keep off fever, Castor 
and Pollux to protect horsemen, etc. 33] Even though we should imagine that the 
invocation of saints were taught with the greatest prudence, yet since the exam-
ple is most dangerous, why is it necessary to defend it when it has no command 
or testimony from God’s Word? Aye, it has not even the testimony of the ancient 
writers. 34] First because, as I have said above, when other mediators are sought in 
The Lutheran Confessions
202
addition to Christ, and confidence is put in others, the entire knowledge of Christ 
is suppressed. The subject shows this. In the beginning, mention of the saints seems 
to have been admitted with a design that is endurable, as in the ancient prayers. 
Afterwards invocation followed, and abuses that are prodigious and more than 
heathenish followed invocation. From invocation the next step was to images; these 
also were worshiped, and a virtue was supposed to exist in these, just as magicians 
imagine that a virtue exists in images of the heavenly bodies carved at a particu-
lar time. In a certain monastery we [some of us] have seen a statue of the blessed 
Virgin, which moved automatically by a trick [within by a string], so as to seem 
either to turn away from [those who did not make a large offering] or nod to those 
making request.
35] Still the fabulous stories concerning the saints, which are publicly taught with 
great authority, surpass the marvelous tales of the statues and pictures. Barbara, 
amidst her torments, asks for the reward that no one who would invoke her should 
die without the Eucharist. Another, standing on one foot, recited daily the whole 
psaltery. Some wise man painted [for children] Christophorus [which in German 
means Bearer of Christ], in order by the allegory to signify that there ought to be 
great strength of mind in those who would bear Christ, i.e., who would teach or 
confess the Gospel, because it is necessary to undergo the greatest dangers [for 
they must wade by night through the great sea, i.e., endure all kinds of temptations 
and dangers]. Then the foolish monks taught among the people that they ought 
to invoke Christophorus, as though such a Polyphemus (such a giant who bore 
Christ through the sea] had once existed. And although 36] the saints performed 
very great deeds, either useful to the state or affording private examples, the 
remembrance of which would conduce much both toward strengthening faith 
and toward following their example in the administration of affairs, no one has 
searched for these from true narratives. [Although God Almighty through His 
saints, as a peculiar people, has wrought many great things in both realms, in the 
Church and in worldly transactions; although there are many great examples in 
the lives of the saints which would be very profitable to princes and lords, to true 
pastors and guardians of souls, for the government both of the world and of the 
Church, especially for strengthening faith in God, yet they have passed these by, 
and preached the most insignificant matters concerning the saints, concerning 
their hard beds, their hair shirts, etc., which, for the greater part, are falsehoods.] 
Yet indeed it is of advantage to hear how holy men administered governments 
[as in the Holy Scriptures it is narrated of the kings of Israel and Judah], what 
calamities, what dangers they underwent, how holy men were of aid to kings in 
great dangers, how they taught the Gospel, what encounters they had with heretics. 
Examples of mercy are also of service, as when we see the denial forgiven Peter, 
when we see Cyprian forgiven for having been a magician, when we see Augustine, 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
203
having experienced the power of faith in sickness, steadily affirming that God truly 
hears the prayers of believers. It was profitable that such examples as these, which 
contain admonitions for either faith or fear or the administration of the state, be 
recited. 37] But certain triflers, endowed with no knowledge either of faith or for 
governing states, have invented stories in imitation of poems, in which there are 
nothing but superstitious examples concerning certain prayers, certain fastings, 
and certain additions of service for bringing in gain [where there are nothing 
but examples as to how the saints wore hair shirts, how they prayed at the seven 
canonical hours, how they lived upon bread and water]. Such are the miracles 
that have been invented concerning rosaries and similar ceremonies. Nor is there 
need here to recite examples. For the legends, as they call them, and the mirrors of 
examples, and the rosaries, in which there are very many things not unlike the true 
narratives of Lucian, are extant.
38] The bishops, theologians, and monks applaud these monstrous and wicked 
stories [this abomination set up against Christ, this blasphemy, these scandalous, 
shameless lies, these lying preachers; and they have permitted them so long, to the 
great injury of consciences, that it is terrible to think of it] because they aid them 
to their daily bread. They do not tolerate us, who, in order that the honor and 
office of Christ may be more conspicuous, do not require the invocation of saints, 
and censure the abuses in the worship, of saints. 39] And although [even their 
own theologians], all good men everywhere [a long time before Dr. Luther began 
to write] in the correction of these abuses, greatly longed for either the authority 
of the bishops or the diligence of the preachers, nevertheless our adversaries in 
the Confutation altogether pass over vices that are even manifest, as though they 
wish, by the reception of the Confutation, to compel us to approve even the most 
notorious abuses.
40] Thus the Confutation has been deceitfully written, not only on this topic, but 
almost everywhere. [They pretend that they are as pure as gold, that they have 
never muddled the water.] There is no passage in which they make a distinction 
between the manifest abuses and their dogmas. And nevertheless, if there are any 
of sounder mind among them, they confess that many false opinions inhere in 
the doctrine of the scholastics and canonists, and, besides, that in such ignorance 
and negligence of the pastors many abuses crept into the Church. 41] For Luther 
was not [the only one nor] the first to complain of [innumerable] public abuses. 
Many learned and excellent men long before these times deplored the abuses of 
the Mass, confidence in monastic observances, services to the saints intended to 
yield a revenue, the confusion of the doctrine concerning repentance [concerning 
Christ], which ought to be as clear and plain in the Church as possible [without 
which there cannot be nor remain a Christian Church]. We ourselves have heard 
The Lutheran Confessions
204
that excellent theologians desire moderation in the scholastic doctrine, which 
contains much more for philosophical quarrels than for piety. And nevertheless, 
among these the older ones are generally nearer Scripture than are the more recent. 
Thus their theology degenerated more and more. Neither had many good men, who 
from the very first began to be friendly to Luther, any other reason than that they 
saw that he was freeing the minds of men from these labyrinths of most confused 
and infinite discussions which exist among the scholastic theologians and canon-
ists, and was teaching things profitable for godliness.
42] The adversaries, therefore, have not acted candidly in passing over the abuses 
when they wished us to assent to the Confutation. And if they wished to care 
for the interests of the Church [and of afflicted consciences, and not rather to 
maintain their pomp and avarice], especially on that topic, at this occasion, they 
ought to exhort our most excellent Emperor to take measures for the correction 
of abuses [which furnish grounds for derision among the Turks, the Jews, and all 
unbelievers], as we observe plainly enough that he is most desirous of healing and 
well-establishing the Church. But the adversaries do not act so as to aid the most 
honorable and most holy will of the Emperor, but so as in every way to crush [the 
truth and] us. 43] Many signs show that they have little anxiety concerning the 
state of the Church. [They lose little sleep from concern that Christian doctrine 
and the pure Gospel be preached.] They take no pains that there should be among 
the people a summary of the dogmas of the Church. [The office of the ministry 
they permit to be quite desolate.] They defend manifest abuses [they continue every 
day to shed innocent blood] by new and unusual cruelty. They allow no suitable 
teachers in the churches. Good men can easily judge whither these things tend. 
But in this way they have no regard to the interest either of their own authority 
or of the Church. For after the good teachers have been killed and sound doctrine 
suppressed, fanatical spirits will rise up, whom the adversaries will not be able 
to restrain, who both will disturb the Church with godless dogmas, and will 
overthrow the entire ecclesiastical government, which we are very greatly desirous 
of maintaining.
44] Therefore, most excellent Emperor Charles, for the sake of the glory of Christ, 
which we have no doubt that you desire to praise and magnify, we beseech you not 
to assent to the violent counsels of our adversaries, but to seek other honorable 
ways of so establishing harmony that godly consciences are not burdened, that no 
cruelty is exercised against innocent men, as we have hitherto seen, and that sound 
doctrine is not suppressed in the Church. To God most of all you owe the duty 
[as far as this is possible to man] to maintain sound doctrine and hand it down to 
posterity, and to defend those who teach what is right. For God demands this when 
He honors kings with His own name and calls them gods, saying, Ps. 82:6: I have 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
205
said, Ye are gods, namely, that they should attend to the preservation and propaga-
tion of divine things, i.e., the Gospel of Christ, on the earth, and, as the vicars of 
God, should defend the life and safety of the innocent [true Christian teachers and 
preachers].
Article XXII (X): Of Both Kinds In the Lord’s Supper.
1] It cannot be doubted that it is godly and in accordance with the institution 
of Christ and the words of Paul to use both parts in the Lord’s Supper. For Christ 
instituted both parts, and instituted them not for a part of the Church, but for 
the entire Church. For not only the presbyters, but the entire Church uses the 
Sacrament by the authority of Christ, and not by human authority; and this, 2] we 
suppose, the adversaries acknowledge. Now, if Christ has instituted it for the entire 
Church, why is one kind denied to a part of the Church? Why is the use of the oth-
er kind prohibited? Why is the ordinance of Christ changed, especially when He 
Himself calls it His testament? But if it is not allowable to annul man’s testament, 
much less will it be allowable to annul the testament of Christ. 3] And Paul says, 
1 Cor. 11:23ff, that he had received of the Lord that which he delivered. But he had 
delivered the use of both kinds, as the text, 1 Cor. 11, clearly shows. This do [in re-
membrance of Me], he says first concerning His body; afterwards he repeats the same 
words concerning the cup [the blood of Christ]. And then: Let a man examine himself, 
and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. [Here he names both.] These are 
the words of Him who has instituted the Sacrament. And, indeed, he says before 
that those who will use the Lord’s Supper should use both. 4] It is evident, there-
fore, that the Sacrament was instituted for the entire Church. And the custom 
still remains in the Greek churches, and also once obtained in the Latin churches, 
as Cyprian and Jerome testify. For thus Jerome says on Zephaniah: The priests who 
administer the Eucharist, and distribute the Lord’s blood to the people, etc. The Council 
of Toledo gives the same testimony. Nor would it be difficult to accumulate a great 
multitude of testimonies. 5] Here we exaggerate nothing; we but leave the prudent 
reader to determine what should be held concerning the divine ordinance [whether 
it is proper to prohibit and change an ordinance and institution of Christ].
6] The adversaries in the Confutation do not endeavor to [comfort the consciences 
or] excuse the Church, to which one part of the Sacrament has been denied. 
This would have been becoming to good and religious men. For a strong reason 
for excusing the Church, and instructing consciences to whom only a part of 
the Sacrament could be granted, should have been sought. Now these very men 
maintain that it is right to prohibit the other part, and forbid that the use of both 
parts be allowed. 7] First, they imagine that, in the beginning of the Church, it 
The Lutheran Confessions
206
was the custom at some places that only one part was administered. Nevertheless 
they are not able to produce any ancient example of this matter. But they cite the 
passages in which mention is made of bread, as in Luke 24:35, where it is written 
that the disciples recognized Christ in the breaking of bread. They quote also other 
passages, Acts 2:42,46; 20:7, concerning the breaking of bread. But although we do 
not greatly oppose if some receive these passages as referring to the Sacrament, yet 
it does not follow that one part only was given, because, according to the ordinary 
usage of language, by the naming of one part the other is also signified. 8] They 
refer also to Lay Communion, which was not the use of only one kind, but of both; 
and whenever priests are commanded to use Lay Communion [for a punishment 
are not to consecrate themselves, but to receive Communion, however, of both 
kinds, from another], it is meant that they have been removed from the ministry 
of consecration. Neither are the adversaries ignorant of this, but they abuse the 
ignorance of the unlearned, who, when they hear of Lay Communion, immediately 
dream of the custom of our time, by which only a part of the Sacrament is given to 
the laymen.
9] And consider their impudence. Gabriel recounts among other reasons why both 
parts are not given that a distinction should be made between laymen and presby-
ters. And it is credible that the chief reason why the prohibition of the one part 
is defended is this, namely, that the dignity of the order may be the more highly 
exalted by a religious rite. To say nothing more severe, this is a human design; and 
whither this tends can easily be judged. 10] In the Confutation they also quote 
concerning the sons of Eli that, after the loss of the high-priesthood, they were to 
seek the one part pertaining to the priests, 1 Sam. 2:36 (the text reads: Every one 
that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of 
bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priest’s offices (German: Lieber, 
lass mich zu einem Priesterteil) that I may eat a piece of bread]. Here they say that 
the use of one kind was signified. And they add: “Thus, therefore, our laymen ought 
also to be content, with one part pertaining to the priests, with one kind.” The 
adversaries [the masters of the Confutation are quite shameless, rude asses, and] are 
clearly trifling when they are transferring the history of the posterity of Eli to the 
Sacrament. The punishment of Eli is there described. Will they also say this, that as 
a punishment the laymen have been removed from the other part? [They are quite 
foolish and mad.] The Sacrament was instituted to console and comfort terrified 
minds, when they believe that the flesh of Christ, given for the life of the world, is 
food, when they believe that, being joined to Christ [through this food], they are 
made alive. But the adversaries argue that laymen are removed from the other part 
as a punishment. “They ought,” they say, “to be content.” 11] This is sufficient for 
a despot. [That, surely, sounds proud and defiant enough.] But [my lords, may we 
ask the reason] why ought they? “The reason must not be asked, but let whatever 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
207
the theologians say be law.” [Is whatever you wish and whatever you say to be sheer 
truth? See now and be astonished how shameless and impudent the adversaries 
are: they dare to set up their own words as sheer commands of lords; they frankly 
say: The laymen must be content. But what if they must not?] This is a concoction 
of Eck. For we recognize those vainglorious words, which if we would wish to 
criticize, there would be no want of language. For you see how great the impudence 
is. He commands, as a tyrant in the tragedies: “Whether they wish or not, 12] they 
must be content.” Will the reasons which he cites excuse, in the judgment of God, 
those who prohibit a part of the Sacrament, and rage against men using an entire 
Sacrament? [Are they to take comfort in the fact that it is recorded concerning the 
sons of Eli: They will go begging? That will be a shuffling excuse at the judgment seat 
of God.] 13] If they make the prohibition in order that there should be a distin-
guishing mark of the order, this very reason ought to move us not to assent to the 
adversaries, even though we would be disposed in other respects to comply with 
their custom. There are other distinguishing marks of the order of priests and of 
the people, but it is not obscure what design they have for defending this distinc-
tion so earnestly. That we may not seem to detract from the true worth of the 
order, we will not say more concerning this shrewd design.
14] They also allege the danger of spilling and certain similar things, which do 
not have force sufficient 15] to change the ordinance of Christ. [They allege more 
dreams like these, for the sake of which it would be improper to change the 
ordinance of Christ.] And, indeed, if we assume that we are free to use either one 
part or both, how can the prohibition [to use both kinds] be defended? Although 
the Church does not assume to itself the liberty to convert the ordinances of 
Christ into 16] matters of indifference. We indeed excuse the Church which has 
borne the injury [the poor consciences which have been deprived of one part by 
force], since it could not obtain both parts; but the authors who maintain that the 
use of the entire Sacrament is justly prohibited, and who now not only prohibit, 
but even excommunicate and violently persecute those using an entire Sacrament, 
we do not excuse. Let them see to it how they will give an account to God for their 
decisions. 17] Neither is it to be judged immediately that the Church determines 
or approves whatever the pontiffs determine, especially since Scripture prophesies 
concerning the bishops and pastors to effect this as Ezekiel 7:26 says: The Law shall 
perish from the priest [there will be priests or bishops who will know no command 
or law of God].

Article XXIII (XI): Of the Marriage of Priests.
1] Despite the great infamy of their defiled celibacy, the adversaries have the 
presumption not only to defend the pontifical law by the wicked and false pretext 
of the divine name, but even to exhort the Emperor and princes, to the disgrace 
and infamy of the Roman Empire, not to tolerate the marriage of priests. For thus 
they speak. [Although the great, unheard-of lewdness, fornication, and adultery 
among priests, monks, etc., at the great abbeys, in other churches and cloisters, 
has become so notorious throughout the world that people sing and talk about it, 
still the adversaries who have presented the Confutation are so blind and without 
shame that they defend the law of the Pope by which marriage is prohibited, and 
that, with the specious claim that they are defending a spiritual state. Moreover, 
although it would be proper for them to be heartily ashamed of the exceedingly 
shameful, lewd, abandoned, loose life of the wretches in their abbeys and cloisters, 
although on this account alone they should not have the courage to show their face 
in broad daylight, although their evil, restless heart and conscience ought to cause 
them to tremble, to stand aghast, and to be afraid to lift their eyes to our excellent 
Emperor, who loves uprightness, still they have the courage of the hangman, they 
act like the very devil and like all reckless, wanton people, proceeding in blind 
defiance and forgetful of all honor and decency. And these pure, chaste gentlemen 
dare to admonish His Imperial Majesty, the Electors and Princes not to tolerate the 
marriage of priests ad infamiam et ignominiam imperii, that is, to ward off shame and 
disgrace from the Roman Empire. For these are their words, as if their shameful 
life were a great honor and glory to the Church.]
2] What greater impudence has ever been read of in any history than this of the 
adversaries? [Such shameless advocates before a Roman Emperor will not easily 
be found. If all the world did not know them, if many godly, upright people 
among them, their own canonical brethren, had not complained long ago of 
their shameful, lewd, indecent conduct, if their vile, abominable, ungodly, lewd, 
heathenish, Epicurean life, and the dregs of all filthiness at Rome were not quite 
manifest, one might think that their great purity and their inviolate virgin 
chastity were the reason why they could not bear to hear the word woman or 
marriage pronounced, and why they baptize holy matrimony, which the Pope 
himself calls a sacrament, infamiam imperii.] For the arguments which they use 
we shall afterwards review. Now let the wise reader consider this, namely, what 
shame these good-for-nothing men have who say that marriages [which the Holy 
Scriptures praise most highly and command] produce infamy and disgrace to the 
government, as though, indeed, this public infamy of flagitious and unnatural lusts 
which glow among these very holy fathers, who feign that they are Curii and live 
like bacchanals, were a great ornament to the Church! And most things which 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
209
these men do with the greatest license cannot even be named without a breach of 
modesty. 3] And these their lusts they ask you to defend with your chaste right 
hand, Emperor Charles (whom even certain ancient predictions name as the king 
of modest face; for the saying appears concerning you: “One modest in face shall 
reign everywhere”). For they ask that, contrary to divine law, contrary to the law 
of nations, contrary to the canons of Councils, you sunder marriages, in order to 
impose merely for the sake of marriage atrocious punishments upon innocent men, 
to put to death priests, whom even barbarians reverently spare, to drive into exile 
banished women and fatherless children. Such laws they bring to you, most excel-
lent and most chaste Emperor, to which no barbarity, however monstrous and 4] 
cruel, could lend its ear. But because the stain of no disgrace or cruelty falls upon 
your character, we hope that you will deal with us mildly in this matter, especially 
when you have learned that we have the weightiest reasons for our belief, derived 
from the Word of God, to which the adversaries oppose the most trifling and vain 
opinions.
5] And nevertheless they do not seriously defend celibacy. For they are not 
ignorant how few there are who practise chastity, but [they stick to that 
comforting saying which is found in their treatise, Si non caste, tamen caute (If not 
chastely, at least cautiously), and] they devise a sham of religion for their dominion, 
which they think that celibacy profits, in order that we may understand Peter to 
have been right in admonishing, 2 Pet. 2:1, that there will be false teachers who will 
deceive men with feigned words. For the adversaries say, write, or do nothing truly 
[their words are merely an argument ad hominem], frankly, and candidly in this 
entire case, but they actually contend only concerning the dominion which they 
falsely think to be imperiled, and which they endeavor to fortify with a wicked pre-
tense of godliness [they support their case with nothing but impious, hypocritical 
lies; accordingly, it will endure about as well as butter exposed to the sun].
6] We cannot approve this law concerning celibacy which the adversaries defend, 
because it conflicts with divine and natural law, and is at variance with the very 
canons of the Councils. And that it is superstitious and dangerous is evident. 
For it produces infinite scandals, sins, and corruption of public morals [as is seen 
in the real towns of priests, or, as they are called, their residences]. Our other 
controversies need some discussion by the doctors; in this the subject is so manifest 
to both parties that it requires no discussion. It only requires as judge a man that is 
honest and fears God. And although the manifest truth is defended by us, yet the 
adversaries have devised certain reproaches for satirizing our arguments.
7] First, Gen. 1:28 teaches that men were created to be fruitful, and that one sex in 
a proper way should desire the other. For we are speaking not of concupiscence, 
The Lutheran Confessions
210
which is sin, but of that appetite which was to have been in nature in its integrity 
[which would have existed in nature even if it had remained uncorrupted], which 
they call physical love. And this love of one sex for the other is truly a divine 
ordinance. But since this ordinance of God cannot be removed without an 
extraordinary work of God, it follows that the right to contract marriage cannot be 
removed by statutes or vows.
8] The adversaries cavil at these arguments; they say that in the beginning the 
commandment was given to replenish the earth, but that now since the earth has 
been replenished, marriage is not commanded. See how wisely they judge! The 
nature of men is so formed by the word of God that it is fruitful not only in the 
beginning of the creation, but as long as this nature of our bodies will exist; just 
as the earth becomes fruitful by the word Gen. 1:11: Let the earth bring forth grass, 
yielding seed. Because of this ordinance the earth not only commenced in the 
beginning to bring forth plants, but the fields are clothed every year as long as this 
natural order will exist. Therefore, just as by human laws the nature of the earth 
cannot be changed, so, without a special work of God, the nature of a human being 
can be changed neither by vows nor by human law [that a woman should not desire 
a man, nor a man a woman].
9] Secondly, And because this creation or divine ordinance in man is a natural 
right, jurists have accordingly said wisely and correctly that the union of male and 
female belongs to natural right. But since natural right is immutable, the right to 
contract marriage must always remain. For where nature does not change, that 
ordinance also with which God has endowed nature does not change, and cannot 
be removed by human laws. 10] Therefore it is ridiculous for the adversaries to 
prate that marriage was commanded in the beginning, but is not now. This is the 
same as if they would say: Formerly, when men were born, they brought with them 
sex; now they do not. Formerly, when they were born, they brought with them 
natural right; now they do not. No craftsman (Faber) could produce anything more 
crafty than these absurdities, which were devised to elude a right of nature. 11] 
Therefore let this remain in the case which both Scripture teaches and the jurist 
says wisely, namely, that the union of male and female belongs to natural right. 
12] Moreover, a natural right is truly a divine right, because it is an ordinance 
divinely impressed upon nature. But inasmuch as this right cannot be changed 
without an extraordinary work of God, it is necessary that the right to contract 
marriage remains, because the natural desire of sex for sex is an ordinance of God 
in nature, and for this reason is a right; otherwise, why would both sexes have been 
created? 13] And we are speaking, as it has been said above, not of concupiscence, 
which is sin, but of that desire which they call physical love [which would have 
existed between man and woman even though their nature had remained pure], 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
211
which concupiscence has not removed from nature, but inflames, so that now it 
has greater need of a remedy, and marriage is necessary not only for the sake of 
procreation, but also as a remedy [to guard against sins]. These things are clear, and 
so well established that they can in no way be overthrown.
14] Thirdly, Paul says, 1 Cor. 7:2: To avoid fornication, let every man have his own 
wife. This now is an express command pertaining to all who are not fit for celibacy. 
15] The adversaries ask that a commandment be shown them which commands 
priests to marry. As though priests are not men! We judge indeed that the things 
which we maintain concerning human nature in general pertain also to priests. 16] 
Does not Paul here command those who have not the gift of continence to marry? 
For he interprets himself a little after when he says, 7:9: It is better to marry than 
to burn. And Christ has clearly said, Matt. 19:11: All men cannot receive this saying, 
save they to whom it is given. Because now, since sin [since the fall of Adam], these 
two things concur, namely, natural appetite and concupiscence, which inflames 
the natural appetite, so that now there is more need of marriage than in nature in 
its integrity, Paul accordingly speaks of marriage as a remedy, and on account of 
these flames commands to marry. Neither can any human authority, any law, any 
vows remove this declaration: It is better to marry than to burn, because they do not 
remove the nature or concupiscence. 17] Therefore all who burn, retain the right to 
marry. By this commandment of Paul: To avoid fornication, let every man have his own 
wife, all are held bound who do not truly keep themselves continent; the decision 
concerning which pertains to the conscience of each one.
18] For as they here give the command to seek continence of God, and to weaken 
the body by labors and hunger, why do they not proclaim these magnificent 
commandments to themselves? But, as we have said above, the adversaries are 
only playing; they are doing nothing seriously. 19] If continence were possible 
to all, it would not require a peculiar gift. But Christ shows that it has need of 
a peculiar gift; therefore it does not belong to all. God wishes the rest to use 
the common law of nature which He has instituted. For God does not wish His 
ordinances, His creations to be despised. He wishes men to be chaste in this way, 
that they use the remedy divinely presented, just as He wishes to nourish our life 
in this way, 20] that we use food and drink. Gerson also testifies that there have 
been many good men who endeavored to subdue the body, and yet made little 
progress. Accordingly, Ambrose is right in saying: Virginity is only a thing that can 
be recommended, but not commanded; 21] it is a matter of vow rather than of precept. If 
any one here would raise the objection that Christ praises those which have made 
themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake, Matt. 19:12, let him also 
consider this, that He is praising such as have the gift of continence; for on this 
account He adds: He that is able to receive it, let him receive it. 22] For an impure 
The Lutheran Confessions
212
continence [such as there is in monasteries and cloisters] does not please Christ. 
We also praise true continence. But now we are disputing concerning the law, and 
concerning those who do not have the gift of continence. The matter ought to be 
left free, and snares ought not to be cast upon the weak through this law.
23] Fourthly, The pontifical law differs also from the canons of the Councils. For 
the ancient canons do not prohibit marriage, neither do they dissolve marriages 
that have been contracted, even if they remove from the administration of their 
office those who have contracted them in the ministry. At those times this dismiss-
al was an act of kindness [rather than a punishment]. But the new canons, which 
have not been framed in the Synods, but have been made according to the private 
judgment of the Popes, both prohibit the contraction of marriages, and dissolve 
them when contracted; and this is to be done openly, contrary to the command of 
Christ, Matt. 19:6: What God hath joined together, let not man 24] put asunder. In 
the Confutation the adversaries exclaim that celibacy has been commanded by the 
Councils. We do not find fault with the decrees of the Councils; for under a certain 
condition these allow marriage; but we find fault with the laws which, since the an-
cient Synods, the Popes of Rome have framed contrary to the authority of the Syn-
ods. 25] The Popes despise the authority of the Synods, just as much as they wish 
it to appear holy to others [under peril of God’s wrath and eternal damnation]. 
Therefore this law concerning perpetual celibacy is peculiar to this new pontifical 
despotism. Nor is it without a reason. For Daniel 11:37, ascribes to the kingdom of 
Antichrist this mark, namely, the contempt of women.
26] Fifthly, Although the adversaries do not defend the law because of superstition, 
[not because of its sanctity, as from ignorance], since they see that it is not gener-
ally observed, nevertheless they diffuse superstitious opinions, while they give a 
pretext of religion. They proclaim that they require celibacy because it is purity. As 
though marriage were impurity and a sin, or as though celibacy merited justifica-
tion more than does marriage! 27] And to this end they cite the ceremonies of the 
Mosaic Law, because, since, under the Law, the priests, at the time of ministering, 
were separated from their wives, the priest in the New Testament, inasmuch as he 
ought always to pray, ought always to practise continence. This silly comparison 
is presented as a proof which should compel priests to perpetual celibacy, 
although, indeed, in this very comparison marriage is allowed, only in the time of 
ministering its use is interdicted. And it is one thing to pray: another, to minister. 
The saints prayed even when they did not exercise the public ministry; nor did 
conjugal intercourse hinder them from praying.
28] But ye shall reply in order to these figments. In the first place, it is necessary 
for the adversaries to acknowledge this, namely, that in believers marriage is pure 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
213
because it has been sanctified by the Word of God, i.e., it is a matter that is permit-
ted and approved by the Word of God, as Scripture abundantly testifies. 29] For 
Christ calls marriage a divine union, when He says, Matt. 19:6: What 30] God hath 
joined together [let not man put asunder. Here Christ says that married people are 
joined together by God. Accordingly, it is a pure, holy, noble, praiseworthy work 
of God]. And Paul says of marriage, of meats and similar things, 1 Tim. 4:5: It is 
sanctified by the Word of God and prayer, i.e., by the Word, by which consciences 
become certain that God approves; and by prayer, i.e., by faith, which uses it with 
thanksgiving 31] as a gift of God. Likewise, 1 Cor. 7:14, The unbelieving husband 
is sanctified by the wife, etc., i.e., the use of marriage is permitted and holy on 
account of faith in Christ, just as it is permitted to use meat, etc. Likewise, 32] 1 
Tim. 2:15: She shall be saved in childbearing [if they continue in faith], etc. If the 
adversaries could produce such a passage concerning celibacy, then indeed they 
would celebrate a wonderful triumph. Paul says that woman is saved by childbear-
ing. What more honorable could be said against the hypocrisy of celibacy than 
that woman is saved by the conjugal works themselves, by conjugal intercourse, 
by bearing children and the other duties? But what does St. Paul mean? Let the 
reader observe that faith is added, and that domestic duties without faith are 
not praised. If they continue, he says, in faith. For he speaks of the whole class of 
mothers. Therefore he requires especially faith [that they should have God’s Word 
and be believing], by which woman receives the remission of sins and justification. 
Then he adds a particular work of the calling, just as in every man a good work of a 
particular calling ought to follow faith. This work pleases God on account of faith. 
Thus the duties of the woman please God on account of faith, and the believing 
woman is saved who in such duties devoutly serves her calling.
33] These testimonies teach that marriage is a lawful [a holy and Christian] thing. 
If therefore purity signifies that which is allowed and approved before God, 
marriages are pure, because they have been approved by the Word of God. 34] And 
Paul says of lawful things, Titus 1:15: Unto the pure all things are pure, i.e., to those 
who believe in Christ and are righteous by faith. Therefore, as virginity is impure 
in the godless, so in the godly marriage is pure on account of the Word of God and 
faith.
35] Again, if purity is properly opposed to concupiscence, it signifies purity of 
heart, i.e., mortified concupiscence, because the Law does not prohibit marriage, 
but concupiscence, adultery, fornication. Therefore celibacy is not purity. For there 
may be greater purity of heart in a married man, as in Abraham or Jacob, than in 
most of those who are even truly continent [who even, according to bodily purity, 
really maintain their chastity].
The Lutheran Confessions
214
36] Lastly, if they understand that celibacy is purity in the sense that it merits 
justification more than does marriage, we most emphatically contradict it. For we 
are justified neither on account of virginity nor on account of marriage, but freely 
for Christ’s sake, when we believe that for His sake 37] God is propitious to us. 
Here perhaps they will exclaim that, according to the manner of Jovinian, marriage 
is made equal to virginity. But, on account of such clamors we shall not reject the 
truth concerning the righteousness 38] of faith, which we have explained above. 
Nevertheless we do not make virginity and marriage equal. For just as one gift 
surpasses another, as prophecy surpasses eloquence, the science of military affairs 
surpasses agriculture, and eloquence surpasses architecture, so virginity is a more 
excellent gift than 39] marriage. And nevertheless, just as an orator is not more 
righteous before God because of his eloquence than an architect because of his skill 
in architecture, so a virgin does not merit justification by virginity more than a 
married person merits it by conjugal duties, but each one ought faithfully to serve 
in his own gift, and to believe that for Christ’s sake he receives the remission of sins 
and by faith is accounted righteous before God.
40] Neither does Christ or Paul praise virginity because it justifies, but because it is 
freer and less distracted with domestic occupations, in praying, teaching, [writing,] 
serving. For this reason Paul says, 1 Cor. 7:32: He that is unmarried careth for the 
things which belong to the Lord. Virginity, therefore, is praised on account of 
meditation and study. Thus Christ does not simply praise those who make themselves 
eunuchs, but adds, for the kingdom of heaven’s sake, i.e., that they may have leisure to 
learn or teach the Gospel; for He does not say that virginity merits the remission of 
sins or salvation.
41] To the examples of the Levitical priests we have replied that they do not 
establish the duty of imposing perpetual celibacy upon the priests. Furthermore, 
the Levitical impurities are not to be transferred to us. [The law of Moses, with 
the ceremonial statutes concerning what is clean or unclean, do not at all concern 
us Christians.] Then intercourse contrary to the Law was an impurity. Now it is 
not impurity, because Paul says, Titus 1:15: Unto the pure all things are pure. For 
the Gospel frees us from these 42] Levitical impurities [from all the ceremonies 
of Moses, and not alone from the laws concerning uncleanness]. And if any 
one defends the law of celibacy with the design to burden consciences by these 
Levitical observances, we must strive against this, just as the apostles in Acts 
15:10sqq. strove against those who required circumcision and endeavored to impose 
the Law of Moses upon Christians.
43] Yet, in the meanwhile, good men will know how to control the use of marriage, 
especially when they are occupied with public offices, which often, indeed, give 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
215
good men so much labor as to expel all domestic thoughts from their minds. [For 
to be burdened with great affairs and transactions, which concern commonwealths 
and nations, governments and churches, is a good remedy to keep the old Adam 
from lustfulness.] Good men know also this, that Paul, 1 Thess. 4:4, commands 
that every one possess his vessel in sanctification [and honor, not in the lust of 
concupiscence]. They know likewise that they must sometimes retire, in order that 
there may be leisure for prayer; but Paul does not wish this 44] to be perpetual, 1 
Cor. 7:5. Now such continence is easy to those who are good and occupied. But this 
great crowd of unemployed priests which is in the fraternities cannot afford, in 
this voluptuousness, even this Levitical continence, as the facts show. [On the other 
hand, what sort of chastity can there be among so many thousands of monks and 
priests who live without worry in all manner of delights, being idle and full, and, 
moreover, have not the Word of God, do not learn it, and have no regard for it. 
Such conditions bring on all manner of inchastity. Such people can observe neither 
Levitical nor perpetual chastity.] And the lines are well known: The boy accustomed 
to pursue a slothful life hates those who are busy.
45] Many heretics understanding the Law of Moses incorrectly have treated mar-
riage with contempt, for whom, nevertheless, celibacy has gained extraordinary 
admiration. And Epiphanius complains that, by this commendation especially, the 
Encratites captured the minds of the unwary. They abstained from wine even in the 
Lord’s Supper; they abstained from the flesh of all animals, in which they surpassed 
the Dominican brethren, who live upon fish. They abstained also from marriage; 
and just this gained the chief admiration. These works, these services, they thought, 
merited grace more than the use of wine and flesh, and than marriage, which 
seemed to be a profane and unclean matter, and which scarcely could please God, 
even though it were not altogether condemned.
46] Paul to the Colossians 2:18, greatly disapproves these angelic forms of wor-
ship. For when men believe that they are pure and righteous on account of such 
hypocrisy, they suppress the knowledge of Christ, and suppress also the knowledge 
of God’s gifts and commandments. For God wishes 47] us to use His gifts in a 
godly way. And we might mention examples where certain godly consciences were 
greatly disturbed on account of the lawful use of marriage. This evil was derived 
from the opinions of monks superstitiously praising celibacy [and proclaiming the 
married estate as a life that would be a great obstacle to salvation, and full of sins]. 
48] Nevertheless we do not find fault with temperance or continence, but we have 
said above that exercises and mortifications of the body are necessary. We indeed 
deny that confidence should be placed in certain observances, as though they made 
righteous. 49] And Epiphanius has elegantly said that these observances ought to 
be praised ((greek)), i.e., for restraining the body or on account of public morals; just as 
The Lutheran Confessions
216
certain rites were instituted for instructing the ignorant, and not as services that 
justify.
50] But it is not through superstition that our adversaries require celibacy, for 
they know that chastity is not ordinarily rendered [that at Rome, also in all their 
monasteries, there is nothing but undisguised, unconcealed inchastity. Nor do they 
seriously intend to lead chaste lives, but knowingly practise hypocrisy before the 
people]. But they feign superstitious opinions, so as to delude the ignorant. They 
are therefore more worthy of hatred than the Encratites, who seem to have erred 
by show of religion; these Sardanapali [Epicureans] designedly misuse the pretext 
of religion.
51] Sixthly. Although we have so many reasons for disapproving the law of per-
petual celibacy, yet, besides these, dangers to souls and public scandals also are 
added, which even, though the law were not unjust, ought to deter good men from 
approving such a burden as has destroyed innumerable souls.
52] For a long time all good men [their own bishops and canons) have complained 
of this burden, either on their own account, or on account of others whom they 
saw to be in danger. But no Popes give ear to these complaints. Neither is it 
doubtful how greatly injurious to public morals this law is, and what vices and 
shameful lusts it has produced. The Roman satires are extant. In these Rome still 
recognizes and reads its own morals.
53] Thus God avenges the contempt of His own gift and ordinance in those who 
prohibit marriage. But since the custom in regard to other laws was that they 
should be changed if manifest utility would advise it, why is the same not done 
with respect to this law, in which so many weighty reasons concur, especially in 
these last times, why a change ought to be made? Nature is growing old and is 
gradually becoming weaker, and vices are increasing; wherefore the remedies 54] 
divinely given should have been employed. We see what vice it was which God de-
nounced before the Flood, what He denounced before the burning of the five cit-
ies. Similar vices have preceded the destruction of many other cities, as of Sybaris 
and Rome. And in these there has been presented an image of the times which will 
be next to the end of things. 55] Accordingly, at this time, marriage ought to have 
been especially defended by the most severe laws and warning examples, and men 
ought to have been invited to marriage. This duty pertains to the magistrates, who 
ought to maintain public discipline. [God has now so blinded the world that adul-
tery and fornication are permitted almost without punishment; on the contrary, 
punishment is inflicted on account of marriage. Is not this terrible to hear?] Mean-
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
217
while the teachers of the Gospel should do both; they should exhort incontinent 
men to marriage, and should exhort others not to despise the gift of continence.
56] The Popes daily dispense and daily change other laws which are most excellent, 
yet, in regard to this one law of celibacy, they are as iron and inexorable, although, 
indeed, it is manifest that this is simply of human right. 57] And they are now 
making this law more grievous in many ways. The canon bids them suspend priests; 
these rather unfriendly interpreters suspend them not from office, but from trees. 
They cruelly kill many men for nothing but marriage. [It is to be feared, therefore, 
that the blood of Abel will cry to heaven so loudly as not to be endured, and that 
we shall have to tremble like Cain.] 58] And these very parricides show that this 
law is a doctrine of demons. For since the devil is a murderer, he defends his law by 
these parricides.
59] We know that there is some offense in regard to schism, because we seem 
to have separated from those who are thought to be regular bishops. But our 
consciences are very secure, since we know that, though we most earnestly desire to 
establish harmony, we cannot please the adversaries unless we cast away manifest 
truth, and then agree with these very men in being willing to defend this unjust 
law, to dissolve marriages that have been contracted, to put to death priests if they 
do not obey, to drive poor women and fatherless children into exile. But since 
it is well established that these conditions are displeasing to God, we can in no 
way grieve that we have no alliance with the multitude of murderers among the 
adversaries.
60] We have explained the reasons why we cannot assent with a good conscience to 
the adversaries when they defend the pontifical law concerning perpetual celibacy, 
because it conflicts with divine and natural law and is at variance with the canons 
themselves, and is superstitious and full of danger, and, lastly, because the whole 
affair is insincere. For the law is enacted not for the sake of religion [not for holi-
ness’ sake, or because they do not know better; they know very well that everybody 
is well acquainted with the condition of the great cloisters, which we are able to 
name], but for the sake of dominion, and this is wickedly given the pretext of reli-
gion. Neither can anything be produced by sane men against these 61] most firmly 
established reasons. The Gospel allows marriage to those to whom it is necessary. 
Nevertheless, it does not compel those to marry who can be continent, provided 
they be truly continent. We hold that this liberty should also be conceded to the 
priests, nor do we wish to compel any one by force to celibacy, nor to dissolve 
marriages that have been contracted.
The Lutheran Confessions
218
62] We have also indicated incidentally, while we have recounted our arguments, 
how the adversaries cavil at several of these; and we have explained away these false 
accusations. Now we shall relate as briefly as possible with what important reasons 
63] they defend the law. First, they say that it has been revealed by God. You see the 
extreme impudence of these sorry fellows. They dare to affirm that the law of per-
petual celibacy has been divinely revealed, although it is contrary to manifest tes-
timonies of Scripture, which command that to avoid fornication each one should 
have his own wife, 1 Cor. 7:2; which likewise forbid to dissolve marriages that have 
been contracted; cf. Matt. 5:32; 19:6; 1 Cor. 7:27. [What can the knaves say in reply? 
and how dare they wantonly and shamelessly misapply the great, most holy name 
of the divine Majesty?] Paul reminds us what an author such a law was to have 
when he calls it a doctrine of demons, 1 Tim. 4:1. And the fruits show their author, 
namely, so many monstrous lusts and so many murders which are now committed 
under the pretext of that law [as can be seen at Rome].
64] The second argument of the adversaries is that the priests ought to be pure, 
according to Is. 52:11: Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. And they cite 
many things to this effect. This reason which they display we have above removed 
as especially specious. For we have said that virginity without faith is not purity be-
fore God, and marriage, on account of faith, is pure, according to Titus 1:15: Unto 
the pure all things are pure. We have said also this, that outward purity and the 
ceremonies of the Law are not to be transferred hither, because the Gospel requires 
purity of heart, and does not require the ceremonies of the Law. And it may occur 
that the heart of a husband, as of Abraham or Jacob, who were polygamists, is pur-
er and burns less with lusts than that of many virgins who are even truly continent. 
But what Isaiah says: Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord, ought to be under-
stood as referring to cleanness of heart and to the entire repentance. 65] Besides, 
the saints will know in the exercise of marriage how far it is profitable to restrain 
its use, and as Paul says, 1 Thess. 4:4 66] to possess his vessel in sanctification. 
Lastly, since marriage is pure, it is rightly said to those who are not continent in 
celibacy that they should marry wives in order to be pure. Thus the same law: Be 
ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord, commands that impure celibates become 
pure husbands [impure unmarried priests become pure married priests].
67] The third argument is horrible, namely, that the marriage of priests is the 
heresy of Jovinian. Fine-sounding words! [Pity on our poor souls, dear sirs; proceed 
gently!] This is a new crime, that marriage [which God instituted in Paradise] is 
a heresy! [In that case all the world would be children of heretics.] In the time of 
Jovinian the world did not as yet know the law concerning perpetual celibacy. 
[This our adversaries know very well.] Therefore it is an impudent falsehood 
that the marriage of priests is the heresy of Jovinian, or that such marriage was 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
219
then condemned by the Church. 68] In such passages we can see what design the 
adversaries had in writing the Confutation. They judged that the ignorant would 
be thus most easily excited, if they would frequently hear the reproach of heresy, 
if they pretend that our cause had been dispatched and condemned by many 
previous decisions of the Church. Thus they frequently cite falsely the judgment of 
the Church. Because they are not ignorant of this, they were unwilling to exhibit 
to us a copy of their Apology, lest this falsehood and these reproaches might be 
exposed. Our opinion, however, as regards the case of Jovinian, concerning the 
comparison of virginity 69] and marriage, we have expressed above. For we do not 
make marriage and virginity equal, although neither virginity nor marriage merits 
justification.
70] By such false arguments they defend a law that is godless and destructive to 
good morals. By such reasons they set the minds of princes firmly against God’s 
judgment [the princes and bishops who believe this teaching will see whether their 
reasons will endure the test, when the hour of death arrives], in which God will 
call them to account as to why they have dissolved marriages, and why they have 
tortured [flogged and impaled] and killed priests [regardless of the cries, wails, and 
tears of so many widows and orphans]. For do not doubt but that, as the blood of 
dead Abel cried out, Gen. 4:10, so the blood of many good men, against whom they 
have unjustly raged, will also cry out. And God will avenge this cruelty; there you 
will discover how empty are these reasons of the adversaries, and you will perceive 
that in God’s judgment no calumnies against God’s Word remain standing, as 
Isaiah says, 40:6: All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of 
the field [that their arguments are straw and hay, and God a consuming fire, before 
whom nothing but God’s Word can abide, 1 Pet. 1:24 ].
71] Whatever may happen, our princes will be able to console themselves with 
the consciousness of right counsels, because even though the priests would have 
done wrong in contracting marriages, yet this disruption of marriages, these 
proscriptions, and this cruelty are manifestly contrary to the will and Word of 
God. Neither does novelty or dissent delight our princes, but especially in a matter 
that is not doubtful more regard had to be paid to the Word of God than to all 
other things.
Article XXIV (XII): Of the Mass.
At the outset we must again make the preliminary statement that we 1] do not 
abolish the Mass, but religiously maintain and defend it. For among us masses are 
celebrated every Lord’s Day and on the other festivals, in which the Sacrament is 
The Lutheran Confessions
220
offered to those who wish to use it, after they have been examined and absolved. 
And the usual public ceremonies are observed, the series of lessons, of prayers, 
vestments, and other like things.
2] The adversaries have a long declamation concerning the use of the Latin 
language in the Mass, in which they absurdly trifle as to how it profits [what a 
great merit is achieved by] an unlearned hearer to hear in the faith of the Church a 
Mass which he does not understand. They evidently imagine that the mere work of 
hearing is a service, that it profits without being understood. 3] We are unwilling 
to malignantly pursue these things, but we leave them to the judgment of the 
reader. We mention them only for the purpose of stating, in passing, that also 
among us the Latin lessons and prayers are retained.
Since ceremonies, however, ought to be observed both to teach men Scripture, 
and that those admonished by the Word may conceive faith and fear [of God, and 
obtain comfort], and thus also may pray (for these are the designs of ceremonies), 
we retain the Latin language on account of those who are learning and understand 
Latin, and we mingle with it German hymns, in order that the people also may 
have something to learn, and by which faith and fear 4] may be called forth. This 
custom has always existed in the churches. For although some more frequently, 
and others more rarely, introduced German hymns, nevertheless the people almost 
everywhere sang something in their own 5] tongue. [Therefore, this is not such a 
new departure.] It has, however, nowhere been written or represented that the act 
of hearing lessons not understood profits men, or that ceremonies profit, not be-
cause they teach or admonish, but ex opere operato, because they are thus performed 
or are looked upon. Away with such pharisaic opinions! [Ye sophists ought to be 
heartily ashamed of such dreams!]
6] The fact that we hold only Public or Common Mass [at which the people also 
commune, not Private Mass] is no offense against the Church catholic. For in the 
Greek churches even today private Masses are not held, but there is only a public 
Mass, and that on the Lord’s Day and festivals. In the monasteries daily Mass is 
held, but this is only public. These are the traces of former customs. For nowhere 
do the ancient writers before Gregory make mention 7] of private Masses. We now 
omit noticing the nature of their origin. It is evident that after the mendicant 
monks began to prevail, from most false opinions and on account of gain they were 
so increased that all good men for a long time desired some limit to this thing. 
Although St. Francis wished to provide aright for this matter, as he decided that 
each fraternity should be content with a single common Mass daily, afterwards this 
was changed, either by superstition or for the sake of gain. Thus, 8] where it is of 
advantage, they themselves change the institutions of the Fathers; and afterwards 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
221
they cite against us the authority of the Fathers. Epiphanius writes that in Asia 
the Communion was celebrated three times a week, and that there were no daily 
Masses. And indeed he says that this custom was handed down from the apostles. 
For he speaks thus: Assemblies for Communion were appointed by the apostles to be held 
on the fourth day, on Sabbath eve, and the Lord’s Day.
9] Moreover, although the adversaries collect many testimonies on this topic to 
prove that the Mass is a sacrifice, yet this great tumult of words will be quieted 
when the single reply is advanced that this line of authorities, reasons and 
testimonies, however long, does not prove that the Mass confers grace ex opere 
operato, or that, when applied on behalf of others, it merits for them the remission 
of venial and mortal sins, of guilt and punishment. This one reply overthrows all 
objections of the adversaries, not only in this Confutation, but in all writings 
which they have published concerning the Mass.
10] And this is the issue [the principal question] of the case of which our readers 
are to be admonished, as Aeschines admonished the judges that just as boxers 
contend with one another for their position, so they should strive with their 
adversary concerning the controverted point, and not permit him to wander 
beyond the case. In the same manner our adversaries ought to be here compelled 
to speak on the subject presented. And when the controverted point has been 
thoroughly understood, a decision concerning the arguments on both sides will be 
very easy.
11] For in our Confession we have shown that we hold that the Lord’s Supper does 
not confer grace ex opere operato, and that, when applied on behalf of others, alive 
or dead, it does not merit for them ex opere operato the remission of sins, of guilt or 
of punishment. 12] And of this position a clear and firm proof exists in that it is 
impossible to obtain the remission of our sins on account of our own work ex opere 
operato [even when there is not a good thought in the heart], but the terrors of sin 
and death must be overcome by faith when we comfort our hearts with the knowl-
edge of Christ, and believe that for Christ’s sake we are forgiven, and that the 
merits and righteousness of Christ are granted us, Rom. 5:1: Being justified by faith, 
we have peace. These things are so sure and so firm that they can stand against all 
the gates of hell.
13] If we are to say only as much as is necessary, the case has already been stated. 
For no sane man can approve that pharisaic and heathen opinion concerning the 
opus operatum. And nevertheless this opinion inheres in the people, and has in-
creased infinitely the number of masses. For masses are purchased to appease God’s 
wrath, and by this work they wish to obtain the remission of guilt and of punish-
The Lutheran Confessions
222
ment; they wish to procure whatever is necessary in every kind of life [health, rich-
es, prosperity, and success in business]; they wish even to liberate the dead. Monks 
and sophists have taught this pharisaic opinion in the Church.
14] But although our case has already been stated, yet, because the adversaries 
foolishly pervert many passages of Scripture to the defense of their errors, we shall 
add a few things on this topic. In the Confutation they have said many things 
concerning “sacrifice,” although in our Confession we purposely avoided this term 
on account of its ambiguity. We have set forth what those persons whose abuses we 
condemn now understand as a sacrifice. Now, in order to explain the passages of 
Scripture that have been wickedly perverted, it is necessary in the beginning to set 
forth what a sacrifice is. 15] Already for an entire period of ten years the adversar-
ies have published almost infinite volumes concerning sacrifice, and yet not one 
of them thus far has given a definition of sacrifice. They only seize upon the name 
“sacrifices” either from the Scriptures or the Fathers [and where they find it in the 
Concordances of the Bible, apply it here, whether it fits or not]. Afterward they 
append their own dreams, as though indeed a sacrifice signifies whatever pleases 
them.
What a Sacrifice Is, and What Are the Species of Sacrifice.
[Now, lest we plunge blindly into this business, we must indicate, in the first place, 
a distinction as to what is, and what is not, a sacrifice. To know this is expedient 
and good for all Christians.] 16] Socrates, in the Phaedrus of Plato, says that he is 
especially fond of divisions, because without these nothing can either be explained 
or understood in speaking, and if he discovers any one skilful in making divisions, 
he says that he attends and follows his footsteps as those of a god. And he instructs 
the one dividing to separate the members in their very joints, lest, like an unskilful 
cook, he break to pieces some member. But the adversaries wonderfully despise 
these precepts, and, according to Plato, are truly kakoi mavgeiroi (poor butchers), 
since they break the members of “sacrifice,” as can be understood when we have 
enumerated the species of sacrifice. 17] Theologians are rightly accustomed to 
distinguish between a Sacrament and a sacrifice. Therefore let the genus compre-
hending both of these be either 18] a ceremony or a sacred work. A Sacrament is 
a ceremony or work in which God presents to us that which the promise annexed 
to the ceremony offers; as, Baptism is a work, not which we offer to God, but in 
which God baptizes us, i.e., a minister in the place of God; and God here offers and 
presents the remission of sins, etc., according to the promise, Mark 16:16: He that 
believeth and is baptized shall be saved. A sacrifice, on the contrary, is a ceremony 
or work which we render God in order to afford Him honor.
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
223
19] Moreover, the proximate species of sacrifice are two, and there are no more. 
One is the propitiatory sacrifice, i.e., a work which makes satisfaction for guilt and 
punishment, i.e., one that reconciles God, or appeases God’s wrath, or which merits 
the remission of sins for others. The other species is the eucharistic sacrifice, which 
does not merit the remission of sins or reconciliation, but is rendered by those who 
have been reconciled, in order that we may give thanks or return gratitude for the 
remission of sins that has been received, or for other benefits received.
20] These two species of sacrifice we ought especially to have in view and placed 
before the eyes in this controversy, as well as in many other discussions; and 
especial care must be taken lest they be confounded. But if the limits of this 
book would suffer it, we would add the reasons for this division. For it has many 
testimonies in the Epistle to the Hebrews and elsewhere. And 21] all Levitical 
sacrifices can be referred to these members as to their own homes [genera]. 
For in the Law certain sacrifices were named propitiatory on account of their 
signification or similitude; not because they merited the remission of sins before 
God, but because they merited the remission of sins according to the righteousness 
of the Law, in order that those for whom they were made might not be excluded 
from that commonwealth [from the people of Israel]. Therefore they were called 
sin-offerings and burnt offerings for a trespass. Whereas the eucharistic sacrifices 
were the oblation, the drink-offering, thank-offerings, first-fruits, tithes.
22] [Thus there have been in the Law emblems of the true sacrifice.] But in fact 
there has been only one propitiatory sacrifice in the world, namely, the death of 
Christ, as the Epistle to the Hebrews 10:4 teaches: It is not possible that the blood 
of bulls and of goats should take away sins. And a little after, of the [obedience 
and] will of Christ, 10:10: By the which will we are sanctified by the offering of the 
body 23] of Jesus Christ once for all. And Isaiah interprets the Law, in order that 
we may know that the death of Christ is truly a satisfaction for our sins, or expia-
tion, and that the ceremonies of the Law are not; wherefore he says, Is. 53:10: When 
Thou shalt make His soul an offering for sin, He will see His seed, etc. For the word 
employed here, asham (greek),signifies a victim for transgression; which signified 
in the Law that a certain Victim was to come to make satisfaction for our sins and 
reconcile God, in order that men might know that God wishes to be reconciled 
to us, not on account of our own righteousnesses, but on account of the merits of 
another, namely, of Christ. Paul interprets the same word asham as sin, Rom. 8:3: 
For sin (God) condemned sin, i.e., He punished sin for sin, i.e., by a Victim for sin. 
The significance of the word can be the more easily understood from the customs 
of the heathen, which, we see, have been received from the misunderstood ex-
pressions of the Fathers. The Latins called a victim that which in great calamities, 
where God seemed to be especially enraged, was offered to appease God’s wrath, 
The Lutheran Confessions
224
a piaculum; and they sometimes sacrificed human victims, perhaps because they 
had heard that a human victim would appease God for the entire human race. 
The Greeks sometimes called them kaqavrmata and sometimes periyhvmata. Isaiah 
and Paul, therefore, mean that Christ became a victim, 24] i.e., an expiation, that 
by His merits, and not by our own, God might be reconciled. Therefore let this 
remain established in the case, namely, that the death of Christ alone is truly a 
propitiatory sacrifice. For the Levitical propitiatory sacrifices were so called only 
to signify a future expiation. On account of a certain resemblance, therefore, they 
were satisfactions redeeming the righteousness of the Law, lest those persons who 
sinned should be excluded from the commonwealth. But after the revelation of 
the Gospel [and after the true sacrifice has been accomplished] they had to cease; 
and because they had to cease in the revelation of the Gospel, they were not truly 
propitiations, since the Gospel was promised for this very reason, namely, to set 
forth a propitiation.
25] Now the rest are eucharistic sacrifices, which are called sacrifices of praise, Lev. 
3:1f.; 7:11f.; Ps. 56:12f., namely, the preaching of the Gospel, faith, prayer, thanksgiv-
ing, confession, the afflictions of saints, yea, all good works of saints. These sacri-
fices are not satisfactions for those making them, or applicable on behalf of others, 
so as to merit for these, ex opere operato, the remission of sins or reconciliation. For 
they are made by those who have been reconciled. 26] And such are the sacrifices 
of the New Testament, as Peter teaches, 1 Pet. 2:5: An holy priesthood, to offer up spir-
itual sacrifices. Spiritual sacrifices, however, are contrasted not only with those of 
cattle, but even with human works offered ex opere operato, because spiritual refers 
to the movements of the Holy Ghost in us. Paul teaches the same thing Rom. 12:1: 
Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable, which is your reasonable service. 
Reasonable servicesignifies, however, a service in which God is known, and appre-
hended by the mind, as happens in the movements of fear and trust towards God. 
Therefore it is opposed not only to the Levitical service, in which cattle are slain, 
but also to a service in which a work is imagined to be offered ex opere operato, The 
Epistle to the Hebrews 13:15, teaches the same thing: By Him, therefore, let us offer the 
sacrifice of praise to God continually; and he adds the interpretation, that is, the fruit of 
our lips, giving thanks to His name. He bids us offer praises, i.e., prayer, thanksgiving, 
confession, and the like. These avail not ex opere operato, but on account of faith. 
This is taught by the clause: By Him let us offer, i.e., by faith in Christ.
27] In short, the worship of the New Testament is spiritual, i.e., it is the 
righteousness of faith in the heart and the fruits of faith. It accordingly abolishes 
the Levitical services. [In the New Testament no offering avails ex opere operato, 
sine bono motu utentis, i.e., on account of the work, without a good thought in the 
heart.] And Christ says, John 4:23. 24: True worshipers shalt worship the Father in 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
225
spirit and in truth; for the Father seeketh such to worship Him. God is a Spirit; and they 
that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth [that is, from the heart, 
with heartfelt fear and cordial faith]. This passage clearly condemns [as absolutely 
devilish, pharisaical, and antichristian] opinions concerning sacrifices which, they 
imagine, avail ex opere operato, and teaches that men ought to worship in spirit, i.e., 
with the dispositions of the heart and by faith. [The Jews also did not understand 
their ceremonies aright, and imagined that they were righteous before God when 
they had wrought works ex opere operato. Against this the prophets contend with 
the greatest earnestness.] Accordingly, 28] the prophets also in the Old Testament 
condemn the opinion of the people concerning the opus operatum, and teach the 
righteousness and sacrifices of the Spirit. Jer. 7:22-23: For I spoke not unto your 
fathers, nor commanded them, in the day that I brought them out of the land of 
Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices; but this thing commanded I them, 
saying, Obey My voice, and I will be your God, etc. How do we suppose that the 
Jews received this arraignment, which seems to conflict openly with Moses? For it 
was evident that God had given the fathers commands concerning burnt offerings 
and victims. But Jeremiah condemns the opinion concerning sacrifices which God 
had not delivered, namely, that these services should please Him ex opere operato. 
But he adds concerning faith that God had commanded this: Hear Me, i.e., believe 
Me that I am your God; that I wish to become thus known when I pity and aid; 
neither have I need of your victims; believe that I wish to be God the Justifier and 
Savior, not on account of works, but on account of My word and promise; truly 
and from the heart seek and expect aid from Me.
29] Ps. 50:13,15, which rejects the victims and requires prayer, also condemns the 
opinion concerning the opus operatum: Will I eat the flesh of bulls? etc. Call upon 
Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me. The Psalm-
ist testifies that this is true service, that this is true honor, if we call upon Him 
from the heart.
Likewise Ps. 40:6: Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not desire; mine ears hast Thou 
opened, i.e., Thou hast offered to me Thy Word that I might hear it, and Thou dost 
require that I believe Thy Word and Thy promises, that Thou truly desirest to pity, 
to bring aid, etc. Likewise Ps. 51:16-17: Thou delightest not in burnt offering. The 
sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou 
wilt not despise. Likewise Ps. 4:5: Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put 
your trust [hope, V.] in the Lord. He bids us hope, and says that this is a righteous 
sacrifice, signifying that other sacrifices are not true and righteous sacrifices. And 
Ps. 116:17: I will offer to Thee the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and will call upon the 
name of the Lord. They call invocation a sacrifice of thanksgiving.
The Lutheran Confessions
226
30] But Scripture is full of such testimonies as teach that sacrifices ex opere operato 
do not reconcile God. Accordingly the New Testament, since Levitical services 
have been abrogated, teaches that new and pure sacrifices will be made, namely, 
faith, prayer, thanksgiving, confession, and the preaching of the Gospel, afflictions 
on account of the Gospel, and the like.
31] And of these sacrifices Malachi 1:11 speaks: From the rising of the sun even 
unto the going down of the same My name shall be great among the Gentiles; 
and in every place incense shall be offered unto My name and a pure offering. The 
adversaries perversely apply this passage to the Mass, and quote the authority of 
the Fathers. A reply, however, is easy, for even if it spoke most particularly of the 
Mass, it would not follow that the Mass justifies ex opere operato, or that, when 
applied to others, it merits the remission of sins, etc. The prophet says nothing 
of those things which the monks and sophists impudently fabricate. 32] Besides, 
the very words of the prophet express his meaning. For they first say this, namely, 
that the name of the Lord will be great. This is accomplished by the preaching of the 
Gospel. For through this the name of Christ is made known, and the mercy of the 
Father, promised in Christ, is recognized. The preaching of the Gospel produces 
faith in those who receive the Gospel. They call upon God, they give thanks to 
God, they bear afflictions for their confession, they produce good works for the 
glory of Christ. Thus the name of the Lord becomes great among the Gentiles. 
Therefore incense and a pure offering signify not a ceremony ex opere operato [not the 
ceremony of the Mass alone], but all those sacrifices through which the name of 
the Lord becomes great, namely, faith, invocation, the preaching 33] of the Gospel, 
confession, etc. And if any one would have this term embrace the ceremony [of 
the Mass], we readily concede it, provided he neither understands the ceremony 
alone, nor teaches that the ceremony profits ex opere operato. For just as among the 
sacrifices of praise, i.e., among the praises of God, we include the preaching of the 
Word, so the reception itself of the Lord’s Supper can be praise or thanksgiving; 
but it does not justify ex opere operato; neither is it to be applied to others so as to 
merit for them the remission of sins. But after a while we shall explain how even 
a ceremony is a sacrifice. Yet, as Malachi speaks of all the services of the New 
Testament, and not only of the Lord’s Supper; likewise, as he does not favor the 
pharisaic opinion of the opus operatum, he is not against us, but rather aids us. For 
he requires services of the heart, through which the name of the Lord becomes 
truly great.
34] Another passage also is cited from Malachi 3:3: And He shall purify the sons 
of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an 
offering of righteousness. This passage clearly requires the sacrifices of the righ-
teous, and hence does not favor the opinion concerning the opus operatum. But the 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
227
sacrifices of the sons of Levi, i.e., of those teaching in the New Testament, are the 
preaching of the Gospel, and the good fruits of preaching, as Paul says, Rom. 15:16: 
Ministering the Gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be ac-
ceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, i.e., that, the Gentiles might be offer-
ings acceptable to God by faith, etc. For in the Law the slaying of victims signified 
both the death of Christ and the preaching of the Gospel, by which this oldness of 
flesh should be mortified, and the new and eternal life be begun in us.
But the adversaries everywhere perversely apply the name sacrifice to the ceremo-
ny alone. They omit the preaching of the Gospel, faith, prayer, and similar things, 
although the ceremony has been established on account of these, and the New 
Testament ought to have sacrifices of the heart, and not ceremonials for sin that 
are to be performed after the manner of the Levitical priesthood.
35] They cite also the daily sacrifice (cf. Ex. 29:38f.; Dan. 8:11f.; 12:11), that, just as in 
the Law there was a daily sacrifice so the Mass ought to be a daily sacrifice of the 
New Testament. The adversaries have managed well if we permit ourselves to be 
overcome by allegories. It is evident, however, that allegories do not produce firm 
proofs [that in matters so highly important before God we must have a sure and 
clear word of God, and not introduce by force obscure and foreign passages; such 
uncertain explanations do not stand the test of God’s judgment]. Although we 
indeed readily suffer the Mass to be understood as a daily sacrifice, provided that 
the entire Mass be understood, i.e., the ceremony with the preaching of the Gospel, 
faith, invocation, and thanksgiving. For these joined together are a daily sacrifice of 
the New Testament, because the ceremony [of the Mass, or the Lord’s Supper] was 
instituted on account of these things; neither is it to be separated from these. Paul 
says accordingly, 1 Cor. 11:26: As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye 
do show the Lord’s death till He come. But it in no way follows from this Levitical 
type that a ceremony justifying ex opere operato is necessary, or ought to be applied 
on behalf of others, that it may merit for them the remission of sins.
36] And the type aptly represents not only the ceremony, but also the preaching 
of the Gospel. In Num. 28:4f. three parts of that daily sacrifice are represented, the 
burning of the lamb, the libation, and the oblation of wheat flour. The Law had pictures 
or shadows of future things. Accordingly, in this spectacle Christ and the entire 
worship of the New Testament are portrayed. The burning of the lamb signifies 
the death of Christ. The libation signifies that everywhere in the entire world, by 
the preaching of the Gospel, believers are sprinkled with the blood of that Lamb, 
i.e., sanctified, as Peter says, 1 Pet. 1:2: Through sanctification of the Spirit, unto 
obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. The oblation of wheat flour 
signifies faith, prayer, and thanksgiving in hearts. 37] As, therefore, in the Old 
The Lutheran Confessions
228
Testament, the shadow is perceived, so in the New the thing signified should be 
sought, and not another type, as sufficient for a sacrifice.
38] Therefore, although a ceremony is a memorial of Christ’s death, nevertheless 
it alone is not the daily sacrifice; but the memory itself is the daily sacrifice, i.e., 
preaching and faith, which truly believes that, by the death of Christ, God has 
been reconciled. A libation is required, i.e., the effect of preaching, in order that, 
being sprinkled by the Gospel with the blood of Christ, we may be sanctified, as 
those put to death and made alive. Oblations also are required, i.e., thanksgiving, 
confessions, and afflictions.
Thus the pharisaic opinion 39] of the opus operatum being cast aside, let us 
understand that spiritual worship and a daily sacrifice of the heart are signified, 
because in the New Testament the substance of good things should be sought for 
[as Paul says: In the Old Testament is the shadow of things to come, but the body and the 
truth is in Christ], i.e., the Holy Ghost, mortification, and quickening. 40] From 
these things it is sufficiently apparent that the type of the daily sacrifice testifies 
nothing against us, but rather for us, because we seek for all the parts signified by 
the daily sacrifice. [We have clearly shown all the parts that belonged to the daily 
sacrifice in the law of Moses, that it must mean a true cordial offering, not an opus 
operatum.] The adversaries falsely imagine that the ceremony alone is signified, and 
not also the preaching of the Gospel, mortification, and quickening of heart, etc. 
[which is the best part of the Mass, whether they call it a sacrifice or anything else].
41] Now, therefore, good men will be able to judge readily that the complaint 
against us that we abolish the daily sacrifice is most false. Experience shows what 
sort of Antiochi they are who hold power in the Church; who under the pretext 
of religion assume to themselves the kingdom of the world, and who rule without 
concern for religion and the teaching of the Gospel; who wage war like kings of 
the world, and 42] have instituted new services in the Church. For in the Mass the 
adversaries retain only the ceremony, and publicly apply this to sacrilegious gain. 
Afterward they feign that this work, as applied on behalf of others, 43] merits for 
them grace and all good things. In their sermons they do not teach the Gospel, 
they do not console consciences, they do not show that sins are freely remitted 
for Christ’s sake; but they set forth the worship of saints, human satisfactions, 
human traditions, and by these they affirm that men are justified before God. And 
although some of these traditions are manifestly godless, nevertheless they defend 
them by violence. If any preachers wish to be regarded more learned, they treat 
of philosophical questions, which neither the people nor even those who propose 
them understand. Lastly, those who are more tolerable teach the Law, and say noth-
ing concerning the righteousness of faith.

44] The adversaries in the Confutation make a great ado concerning the desolation 
of churches, namely, that the altars stand unadorned, without candles and without 
images. These trifles they regard as ornaments to churches. [Although it is not 
true that we abolish all such outward ornaments; yet, even if it were so, Daniel is 
not speaking of such things as are altogether external and do not belong to the 
Christian Church.] It is a far different desolation 45] which Daniel 11:31; 12:11, 
means namely, ignorance of the Gospel. For the people, overwhelmed by the 
multitude and variety of traditions and opinions, were in no way able to embrace 
46] the sum of Christian doctrine. [For the adversaries preach mostly of human 
ordinances, whereby consciences are led from Christ to confidence in their own 
works.] For who of the people ever understood the doctrine of repentance of which 
the adversaries treat? And yet this is the chief topic of Christian doctrine.
Consciences were tormented by the enumeration of offenses and by satisfactions. 
Of faith, by which we freely receive the remission of sins, no mention whatever was 
made by the adversaries. Concerning the exercises of faith, struggling with despair, 
and the free remission of sins for Christ’s sake, all the books and all the sermons 
of the adversaries were silent [worse than worthless, and, moreover, caused untold 
damage]. 47] To these, the horrible profanation of the masses and many other 
godless services in the churches were added. This is the desolation which Daniel 
describes.
48] On the contrary, by the favor of God, the priests among us attend to the min-
istry of the Word, teach the Gospel concerning the blessings of Christ, and show 
that the remission of sins occurs freely for Christ’s sake. This doctrine brings sure 
consolation to consciences. The doctrine of [the Ten Commandments and] good 
works which God commands is also added. The worth and use of the Sacraments 
are declared.
49] But if the use of the Sacrament would be the daily sacrifice, nevertheless we 
would retain it rather than the adversaries, because with them priests hired for 
pay use the Sacrament. With us there is a more frequent and more conscientious 
use. For the people use it, but after having first been instructed and examined. For 
men are taught concerning the true use of the Sacrament that it was instituted 
for the purpose of being a seal and testimony of the free remission of sins, and 
that, accordingly, it ought to admonish alarmed consciences to be truly confident 
and believe that their sins are freely remitted. Since, therefore, we retain both the 
preaching of the Gospel and the lawful use of the Sacrament, the daily sacrifice 
remains with us.

50] And if we must speak of the outward appearance, attendance upon church is 
better among us than among the adversaries. For the audiences are held by useful 
and clear sermons. But neither the people nor the teachers have ever understood 
the doctrine of the adversaries. [There is nothing that so attaches people to the 
church as good preaching. But our adversaries preach their people out of the 
churches; for they teach nothing of the necessary parts of Christian doctrine; they 
narrate the legends of saints and other fables.] And 51] the true adornment of the 
churches is godly, useful, and clear doctrine, the devout use of the Sacraments, 
ardent prayer, and the like. Candles, golden vessels [tapers, altar-cloths, images), 
and similar adornments are becoming, but they are not the adornment that 
properly belongs to the Church. But if the adversaries make worship consist in 
such matters, and not in the preaching of the Gospel, in faith, and the conflicts of 
faith, they are to be numbered among those whom Daniel describes as worshiping 
their God with gold and silver, Dan. 11:38.
52] They quote also from the Epistle to the Hebrews 5:1: Every high priest taken 
from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God that he may 
offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. Hence they conclude that, since in the New 
Testament there are high priests and priests, it follows that there is also a sacrifice 
for sins. This passage particularly makes an impression on the unlearned, especially 
when the pomp of the priesthood [the garments of Aaron, since in the Old Testa-
ment there were many ornaments of gold, silver, and purple] and the sacrifices of 
the Old Testament are spread before the eyes. This resemblance deceives the igno-
rant, so that they judge that, according to the same manner, a ceremonial sacrifice 
ought to exist among us, which should be applied on behalf of the sins of others, 
just as in the Old Testament. Neither is the service of the masses and the rest of the 
polity of the Pope anything else than false zeal in behalf of the misunderstood Le-
vitical polity. (They have not understood that the New Testament is occupied with 
other matters, and that, if such ceremonies are used for the training of the young, a 
limit must be fixed for them.]
53] And although our belief has its chief testimonies in the Epistle to the Hebrews, 
nevertheless the adversaries distort against us mutilated passages from this Epistle, 
as in this very passage, where it is said that every high priest is ordained to offer 
sacrifices for sins. Scripture itself immediately adds that Christ is High Priest, Heb. 
5:5-6,10. The preceding words speak of the Levitical priesthood, and signify that 
the Levitical priesthood was an image of the priesthood of Christ. For the Levitical 
sacrifices for sins did not merit the remission of sins before God; they were only 
an image of the sacrifice of Christ, which was to be the one propitiatory sacrifice, 
as we have said above. 54] Therefore the Epistle is occupied to a great extent with 
the topic that the ancient priesthood and the ancient sacrifices were instituted not 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
231
for the purpose of meriting the remission of sins before God or reconciliation, but 
only to signify the future sacrifice of Christ alone. 55] For in the Old Testament 
it was necessary for saints to be justified by faith derived from the promise of the 
remission of sins that was to be granted for Christ’s sake, just as saints are also jus-
tified in the New Testament. From the beginning of the world it was necessary for 
all saints to believe that Christ would be the promised offering and satisfaction for 
sins, as Isaiah 53:10 teaches: When Thou shalt make His soul an offering for sin.
56] Since, therefore, in the Old Testament, sacrifices did not merit reconciliation, 
unless by a figure (for they merited civil reconciliation), but signified the coming 
sacrifice, it follows that Christ is the only sacrifice applied on behalf of the sins of 
others. Therefore, in the New Testament no sacrifice is left to be applied for the 
sins of others, except the one sacrifice of Christ upon the cross.
57] They altogether err who imagine that Levitical sacrifices merited the remission 
of sins before God, and, by this example in addition to the death of Christ, require 
in the New Testament sacrifices that are to be applied on behalf of others. This 
imagination absolutely destroys the merit of Christ’s passion and the righteousness 
of faith, and corrupts the doctrine of the Old and New Testaments, and instead of 
Christ makes for us other mediators and propitiators out of the priests and sacrifi-
cers, who daily sell their work in the churches.
58] Therefore, if any one would thus infer that in the New Testament a priest is 
needed to make offering for sins, this must be conceded only of Christ. And the 
entire Epistle to the Hebrews confirms this explanation. And if, in addition to 
the death of Christ, we were to seek for any other satisfaction to be applied for 
the sins of others and to reconcile God, this would be nothing more than to make 
other mediators in addition to Christ. 59] Again, as the priesthood of the New 
Testament is the ministry of the Spirit, as Paul teaches 2 Cor. 3:6, it, accordingly, 
has but the one sacrifice of Christ, which is satisfactory and applied for the sins 
of others. Besides, it has no sacrifices like the Levitical, which could be applied 
ex opere operato on behalf of others; but it tenders to others the Gospel and the 
Sacraments, that by means of these they may conceive faith and the Holy Ghost, 
and be mortified and quickened, because the ministry of the Spirit conflicts with 
the application of an opus operatum. [For, unless there is personal faith and a life 
wrought by the Holy Spirit, the opus operatum of another cannot render me godly 
nor save me.] For the ministry of the Spirit is that through which the Holy Ghost is 
efficacious in hearts; and therefore this ministry is profitable to others, when it is 
efficacious in them, and regenerates and quickens them. This does not occur by the 
application ex opere operato of the work of another on behalf of others.
The Lutheran Confessions
232
60] We have shown the reason why the Mass does not justify ex opere operato, and 
why, when applied on behalf of others, it does not merit remission, because both 
conflict with the righteousness of faith. For it is impossible that remission of sins 
should occur, and the terrors of death and sin be overcome by any work or any-
thing, except by faith in Christ, according to Rom. 5:1: Being justified by faith, we 
have peace
61] In addition, we have shown that the Scriptures, which are cited against us, in 
no way favor the godless opinion of the adversaries concerning the opus operatum. 
All good men among all nations can judge this. 62] Therefore the error of Thomas 
is to be rejected, who wrote: That the body of the Lord, once offered on the cross for 
original debt, is continually offered for daily offenses on the altar, in order that, in this, the 
Church might have 63] a service whereby to reconcile God to herself. The other common 
errors are also to be rejected, as, that the Mass ex opere operato confers grace upon 
one employing it; likewise, that when applied for others, even for wicked persons, 
provided they do not interpose an obstacle, it merits for them the remission of 
sins, of guilt and punishment. All these things are false and godless, and lately 
invented by unlearned monks, and obscure the glory of Christ’s passion and the 
righteousness of faith.
64] And from these errors infinite others sprang, as, that the masses avail when 
applied for many, just as much as when applied individually. The sophists have 
particular degrees of merit, just as money-changers have grades of weight for gold 
or silver. Besides, they sell the Mass, as a price for obtaining what each one seeks: 
to merchants, that business may be prosperous; to hunters, that hunting may be 
successful; and infinite other things. Lastly, they apply it also to the dead; by the 
application of the Sacrament they liberate souls from the pains of purgatory; 
although without faith the Mass is of service not even to the living. 65] Neither are 
the adversaries able to produce even one syllable from the Scriptures in defense of 
these fables which they teach with great authority in the Church; neither do they 
have the testimonies of the ancient Church nor of the Fathers. [Therefore they are 
impious and blind people who knowingly despise and trample under foot the plain 
truth of God.]
What the Fathers Thought concerning Sacrifice.
66] And since we have explained the passages of Scripture which are cited against 
us, we must reply also concerning the Fathers. We are not ignorant that the Mass is 
called by the Fathers a sacrifice; but they do not mean that the Mass confers grace 
ex opere operato, and that, when applied on behalf of others, it merits for them the 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
233
remission of sins, of guilt and punishment. Where are such monstrous stories to be 
found in the Fathers? But they openly testify that they are speaking of thanksgiv-
ing. Accordingly they call it a eucharist. 67] We have said above, however, that a 
eucharistic sacrifice does not merit reconciliation, but is made by those who have 
been reconciled, just as afflictions do not merit reconciliation, but are eucharistic 
sacrifices when those who have been reconciled endure them.
And this reply, in general, to the sayings of the Fathers defends us sufficiently 
against the adversaries. For it is certain that these figments concerning the merit 
of the opus operatum are found nowhere in the Fathers. But in order that the whole 
case may be the better understood, we also shall state those things concerning the 
use of the Sacrament which actually harmonize with the Fathers and Scripture.
Of the Use of the Sacrament, and of Sacrifice.
68] Some clever men imagine that the Lord’s Supper was instituted for two 
reasons. First, that it might be a mark and testimony of profession, just as a par-
ticular shape of hood is the sign of a particular profession. Then they think that 
such a mark was especially pleasing to Christ, namely, a feast to signify mutual 
union and friendship among Christians, because banquets are signs of covenant 
and friendship. But this is a secular view; neither does it show the chief use of the 
things delivered by God; it speaks only of the exercise of love, which men, however 
profane and worldly, understand; it does not speak of faith, the nature of which 
few understand.
69] The Sacraments are signs of God’s will toward us, and not merely signs of men 
among each other; and they are right in defining that Sacraments in the New 
Testament are signs of grace. And because in a sacrament there are two things, 
a sign and the Word, the Word, in the New Testament, is the promise of grace 
added. The promise of the New Testament is the promise of the remission of sins, 
as the text, Luke 22:19, says: This is My body, which is given for you. This cup is the 
New Testament in My blood, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. 70] 
Therefore the Word offers the remission of sins. And a ceremony is, as it were, a 
picture or seal, as Paul, Rom. 4:11, calls it, of the Word, making known the promise. 
Therefore, just as the promise is useless unless it is received by faith, so a ceremony 
is useless unless such faith is added as is truly confident that the remission of sins 
is here offered. And this faith encourages contrite minds. And just as the Word has 
been given in order to excite this faith, so the Sacrament has been instituted in or-
der that the outward appearance meeting the eyes might move the heart to believe 
The Lutheran Confessions
234
[and strengthen faith]. For through these, namely, through Word and Sacrament, 
the Holy Ghost works.
71] And such use of the Sacrament, in which faith quickens terrified hearts, is a 
service of the New Testament, because the New Testament requires spiritual dis-
positions, mortification and quickening. [For according to the New Testament the 
highest service of God is rendered inwardly in the heart.] And for this use Christ 
instituted it, since He commanded them thus to do in remembrance of Him. 72] For 
to remember Christ is not the idle celebration of a show [not something that is 
accomplished only by some gestures and actions], or one instituted for the sake of 
example, as the memory of Hercules or Ulysses is celebrated in tragedies, but it is 
to remember the benefits of Christ and receive them by faith, so as to be quickened 
by them. Psalm 111:4-5 accordingly says: He hath made His wonderful works to 
be remembered: the Lord is gracious and full of compassion. He hath given meat 
unto them that fear Him. For it signifies that the will and mercy of God should be 
discerned in the 73] ceremony. But that faith which apprehends mercy quickens. 
And this is the principal use of the Sacrament, in which it is apparent who are fit 
for the Sacrament, namely, terrified consciences, and how they ought to use it.
74] The sacrifice [thank-offering or thanksgiving] also is added. For there are 
several ends for one object. After conscience encouraged by faith has perceived 
from what terrors it is freed, then indeed it fervently gives thanks for the benefit 
and passion of Christ, and uses the ceremony itself to the praise of God, in order 
by this obedience to show its gratitude; and testifies that it holds in high esteem 
the gifts of God. Thus the ceremony becomes a sacrifice of praise.
75] And the Fathers, indeed, speak of a two-fold effect, of the comfort of 
consciences, and of thanksgiving, or praise. The former of these effects pertains to 
the nature [the right use] of the Sacrament; the latter pertains to the sacrifice. Of 
consolation Ambrose says: Go to Him and be absolved, because He is the remission of 
sins. Do you ask who He is? Hear Him when He says, John 6:35: I am the Bread of life; 
he that cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on He shall never 
thirst. This passage testifies that in the Sacrament the remission of sins is offered; 
it also testifies that this ought to be received by faith. Infinite testimonies to this 
effect are found in the Fathers, all of which the adversaries pervert to the opus ope-
ratum, and to a work to be applied on behalf of others; although the Fathers clearly 
require faith, and speak of the consolation belonging to every one, and not of the 
application.
76] Besides these, expressions are also found concerning thanksgiving, such as 
that most beautifully said by Cyprian concerning those communing in a godly 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
235
way. Piety, says he, in thanking the Bestower of such abundant blessing, makes a distinc-
tion between what has been given and what has been forgiven, i.e., piety regards both 
what has been given and what has been forgiven, i.e., it compares the greatness 
of God’s blessings and the greatness of our evils, sin and death, with each other, 
and gives thanks, etc. And hence the term eucharist arose in the Church. 77] Nor 
indeed is the ceremony itself, the giving of thanks ex opere operato, to be applied on 
behalf of others, in order to merit for them the remission of sins, etc., in order to 
liberate the souls of the dead. These things conflict with the righteousness of faith; 
as though, without faith, a ceremony can profit either the one performing it or 
others.
Of the Term Mass.
78] The adversaries also refer us to philology. From the names of the Mass they 
derive arguments which do not require a long discussion. For even though the Mass 
be called a sacrifice, it does not follow that it must confer grace ex opere operato, 
or, when applied on behalf of others, merit for them the remission of sins, etc. 79] 
Leitourgiva, they say, signifies a sacrifice, and the Greeks call the Mass, liturgy. Why 
do they here omit the old appellation synaxis, which shows that the Mass was for-
merly the communion of many? But let us speak of the word liturgy. 80] This word 
does not properly signify a sacrifice, but rather the public ministry, and agrees 
aptly with our belief, namely, that one minister who consecrates tenders the body 
and blood of the Lord to the rest of the people, just as one minister who preaches 
tenders the Gospel to the people, as Paul says, 1 Cor. 4:1: Let a man so account of 
us as of the ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God, i.e., of the 
Gospel and the Sacraments. And 2 Cor. 5:20: We are ambassadors for Christ, as 81] 
though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ’s stead, Be ye reconciled 
to God. Thus the term leitourgiaagrees aptly with the ministry. For it is an old word, 
ordinarily employed in public civil administrations, and signified to the Greeks 
public burdens, as tribute, the expense of equipping a fleet, or similar things, as 
the oration of Demosthenes, For Leptines, testifies, all of which is occupied with 
the discussion of public duties and immunities: ((greek)), i.e.: He will say that some 
unworthy men, having found an immunity, have withdrawn from public burdens. And 
thus they spoke in the time of the Romans, as the rescript of Pertinax, On the Law 
of Exemption, shows: ((greek), Even though the number of children does not liberate 
parents from all public burdens. And the Commentary upon Demosthenes states that 
leitourgia is a kind of tribute, the expense of the games, the expense of equipping 
vessels, of attending to the gymnasia and similar public offices. 82] And Paul in 2 
Cor. 9:12 employs it for a collection. The taking of the collection not only supplies 
those things which are wanting to the saints, but also causes them to give more 
The Lutheran Confessions
236
thanks abundantly to God, etc. And in Phil. 2:25 he calls Epaphroditus a ((greek)), 
one who ministered to my wants, 83] where assuredly a sacrificer cannot be under-
stood. But there is no need of more testimonies, since examples are everywhere ob-
vious to those reading the Greek writers, in whom leitourgia is employed for public 
civil burdens or ministries. And on account of the diphthong, grammarians do not 
derive it from lite, which signifies prayers, but from public goods, which they call 
leita, so that leitourgeo means, I attend to, I administer public goods.
84] Ridiculous is their inference that, since mention is made in the Holy Scriptures 
of an altar, therefore the Mass must be a sacrifice; for the figure of an altar is 
referred to by Paul only by way of comparison. 85] And they fabricate that the 
Mass has been so called from an altar (midzbeah). What need is there of an etymol-
ogy so far fetched, unless it be to show their knowledge of the Hebrew language? 
What need is there to seek the etymology from a distance, when the term Mass is 
found in Deut. 16:10, where it signifies the collections or gifts of the people, not the 
offering of the priest? For individuals coming to the celebration 86] of the Passover 
were obliged to bring some gift as a contribution. In the beginning the Christians 
also retained this custom. Coming together, they brought bread, wine, and other 
things, as the Canons of the Apostles testify. Thence a part was taken to be con-
secrated; the rest was distributed to the poor. With this custom they also retained 
Mass as the name of the contributions. And on account of such contributions it 
appears also that the Mass was elsewhere called agape, unless one would prefer that 
it was so called on account of the common feast. 87] But let us omit these trifles. 
For it is ridiculous that the adversaries should produce such trifling conjectures 
concerning a matter of such great importance. For although the Mass is called an 
offering, in what does the term favor the dreams concerning the opus operatum, and 
the application which, they imagine, merits for others the remission of sins? And it 
can be called an offering for the reason that prayers, thanksgivings, and the entire 
worship are there offered, as it is also called a eucharist. But neither ceremonies 
nor prayers profit ex opere operato, without faith. Although we are disputing here 
not concerning prayers, but particularly concerning the Lord’s Supper.
[Here you can see what rude asses our adversaries are. They say that the term 
missa is derived from the term misbeach, which signifies an altar; hence we are to 
conclude that the Mass is a sacrifice; for sacrifices are offered on an altar. Again, 
the word liturgia, by which the Greeks call the Mass, is also to denote a sacrifice. 
This claim we shall briefly answer. All the world sees that from such reasons this 
heathenish and antichristian error does not follow necessarily, that the Mass ben-
efits ex opere operato sine bono motu utentis. Therefore they are asses, because in such 
a highly important matter they bring forward such silly things. Nor do the asses 
know any grammar. For missa and liturgia do not mean sacrifice. Missa, in Hebrew, 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
237
denotes a joint contribution. For this may have been a custom among Christians, 
that they brought meat and drink for the benefit of the poor to their assemblies. 
This custom was derived from the Jews, who had to bring such contributions on 
their festivals; these they called missa. Likewise, liturgia, in Greek, really denotes an 
office in which a person ministers to the congregation. This is well applied to our 
teaching, because with us the priest, as a common servant of those who wish to 
commune, ministers to them the holy Sacrament.
Some think that missa is not derived from the Hebrew, but signifies as much as 
remissio, the forgiveness of sin. For, the communion being ended, the announce-
ment used to be made: Ite, missa est: Depart, you have forgiveness of sins. They cite, 
as proof that this is so, the fact that the Greeks used to say: Lais Aphesis ((greek)), 
which also means that they had been pardoned. If this were so, it would be an 
excellent meaning; for in connection with this ceremony forgiveness of sins must 
always be preached and proclaimed. But the case before us is little aided, no matter 
what the meaning of the word missa is.]
88] The Greek canon says also many things concerning the offering, but it shows 
plainly that it is not speaking properly of the body and blood of the Lord, but of 
the whole service, of prayers and thanksgivings. For it says thus: ((greek)). When 
this is rightly understood, it gives no offense. For it prays that we be made worthy 
to offer prayers and supplications and bloodless sacrifices for the people. For he calls even 
prayers bloodless sacrifices. Just as also a little afterward: [((greek)), We offer, he 
says, this reasonable and bloodless service. For they explain this inaptly who would 
rather interpret this of a reasonable sacrifice, and transfer it to the very body of 
Christ, although the canon speaks of the entire worship, and in opposition to the 
opus operatum Paul has spoken of logike latreia(Rom 12:1) [reasonable service], name-
ly, of the worship of the mind, of fear, of faith, of prayer, of thanksgiving, etc.
Of the Mass for the Dead.
89] Our adversaries have no testimonies and no command from Scripture for 
defending the application of the ceremony for liberating the souls of the dead, 
although from this they derive infinite revenue. Nor, indeed, is it a light sin to 
establish such services in the Church without the command of God and without 
the example of Scripture, and to apply to the dead the Lord’s Supper, which was 
instituted for commemoration and preaching among the living [for the purpose 
of strengthening the faith of those who use the ceremony]. This is to violate the 
Second Commandment, by abusing God’s name.
The Lutheran Confessions
238
For, in the first place, it is a dishonor to the Gospel to hold that a ceremony ex 
opere operato, without faith, is a sacrifice reconciling God, and making satisfaction 
for sins. It is horrible saying to ascribe as much to the work of a priest as to the 
death of Christ. Again, sin and death cannot be overcome unless by faith in Christ, 
as Paul teaches, Rom. 5:1: Being justified by faith, we have peace with God, and 
therefore the punishment of purgatory cannot be overcome by the application of 
the work of another.
90] Now we shall omit the sort of testimonies concerning purgatory that the ad-
versaries have: what kinds of punishments they think there are in purgatory; what 
grounds the doctrine of satisfactions has, which we have shown above to be most 
vain. We shall only present this in opposition: It is certain that the Lord’s Supper 
was instituted on account of the remission of guilt. For it offers the remission of 
sins, where it is necessary that guilt be truly understood. (For what consolation 
would we have if forgiveness of sin were here offered us, and yet there would be 
no remission of guilt?] And nevertheless it does not make satisfaction for guilt; 
otherwise the Mass would be equal to the death of Christ. Neither can the remis-
sion of guilt be received in any other way than by faith. Therefore the Mass is not a 
satisfaction, but a promise and Sacrament that require faith.
91] And, indeed, it is necessary that all godly persons be seized with the most 
bitter grief [shed tears of blood, from anguish and sorrow] if they consider that 
the Mass has been in great part transferred to the dead and to satisfactions for 
punishments. This is to banish the daily sacrifice from the Church; this is the 
kingdom of Antiochus, who transferred the most salutary promises concerning 
the remission of guilt and concerning faith to the most vain opinions concerning 
satisfactions; this is to defile the Gospel, to corrupt the use of the Sacraments. 
These are the persons [the real blasphemers] whom Paul has said, 1 Cor. 11:27, to be 
guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, who have suppressed the doctrine con-
cerning faith and the remission of sins, and, under the pretext of satisfactions, have 
devoted the body and blood of the Lord to sacrilegious gain. And they will at some 
time pay the penalty for this sacrilege. [God will one day vindicate the Second 
Commandment, and pour out a great, horrible wrath upon them.] Therefore we 
and all godly consciences should be on our guard against approving the abuses of 
the adversaries.
92] But let us return to the case. Since the Mass is not a satisfaction, either for 
punishment or for guilt, ex opere operato, without faith, it follows that the applica-
tion on behalf of the dead is useless. Nor is there need here of a longer discussion. 
For it is evident that these applications on behalf of the dead have no testimo-
nies from the Scriptures. Neither is it safe, without the authority of Scripture, to 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
239
institute forms of worship in the Church. And if it will at any time be necessary, 
we shall speak at greater length concerning this entire subject. For why should we 
now contend with adversaries who understand neither what a sacrifice, nor what a 
sacrament, nor what remission of sins, nor what faith is?
93] Neither does the Greek canon apply the offering as a satisfaction for the dead, 
because it applies it equally for all the blessed patriarchs, prophets, apostles. It ap-
pears therefore that the Greeks make an offering as thanksgiving, and do not apply 
it as satisfaction for punishments. [For, of course, it is not their intention to deliver 
the prophets and apostles from purgatory, but only to offer up thanks along and 
together with them for the exalted eternal blessings that have been given to them 
and us.] Although they speak, moreover, not of the offering alone of the body and 
blood of the Lord, but of the other parts of the Mass, namely, prayers and thanks-
giving. For after the consecration they pray that it may profit those who partake 
of it; they do not speak of others. Then they add: [“Yet we offer to you this rea-
sonable service for those having departed in faith, forefathers, fathers, patriarchs, 
prophets, apostles,” etc.] Reasonable service, however, does not signify the offering 
itself, but prayers and all things which are there transacted. 94] Now, as regards 
the adversaries’ citing the Fathers concerning the offering for the dead, we know 
that the ancients speak of prayer for the dead, which we do not prohibit; but we 
disapprove of the application ex opere operato of the Lord’s Supper on behalf of the 
dead. Neither do the ancients favor the adversaries concerning the opus operatum. 
And even though they have the testimonies especially of Gregory or the moderns, 
95] we oppose to them the most clear and certain Scriptures. And there is a great 
diversity among the Fathers. They were men, and could err and be deceived. Al-
though if they would now become alive again, and would see their sayings assigned 
as pretexts for the notorious falsehoods which the adversaries teach concerning the 
opus operatum, they would interpret themselves far differently.
96] The adversaries also falsely cite against us the condemnation of Aerius, who, 
they say, was condemned for the reason that he denied that in the Mass an offering 
is made for the living and the dead. They frequently use this dexterous turn, cite 
the ancient heresies, and falsely compare our cause with these in order by this com-
parison to crush us. [The asses are not ashamed of any lies. Nor do they know who 
Aerius was and what he taught.] Epiphanius testifies that Aerius held that prayers 
for the dead are useless. With this he finds fault. Neither do we favor Aerius, but 
we on our part are contending with you who are defending a heresy manifestly 
conflicting with the prophets, apostles, and holy Fathers, namely, that the Mass 
justifies ex opere operato, that it merits the remission of guilt and punishment even 
for the unjust, to whom it is applied, if they do not present an obstacle. Of these 
pernicious errors, which detract from the glory of Christ’s passion, and entirely 
The Lutheran Confessions
240
overthrow the doctrine concerning the righteousness of faith, we disapprove. 97] 
There was a similar persuasion of the godless in the Law, namely, that they merited 
the remission of sins, not freely by faith, but through sacrifices ex opere operato. 
Therefore they increased these services and sacrifices, instituted the worship of 
Baal in Israel, and even sacrificed in the groves in Judah. Therefore the prophets 
condemn this opinion, and wage war not only with the worshipers of Baal, but 
also with other priests who, with this godless opinion, made sacrifices ordained by 
God. But this opinion inheres in the world, and always will inhere, namely, that 
services and sacrifices are propitiations. Carnal men cannot endure that alone to 
the sacrifice of Christ the honor is ascribed that it is a propitiation, because they 
do not understand the righteousness of faith, but ascribe equal honor to the rest of 
the services and sacrifices. 98] Just as, therefore, in Judah among the godless priests 
a false opinion concerning sacrifices inhered; just as in Israel, Baalitic services 
continued, and, nevertheless, a Church of God was there which disapproved of 
godless services, so Baalitic worship inheres in the domain of the Pope, namely, the 
abuse of the Mass, which they apply, that by it they may merit for the unrighteous 
the remission of guilt and punishment. [And yet, as God still kept His Church, 
i.e., some saints, in Israel and Judah, so God still preserved His Church, i.e., some 
saints, under the Papacy, so that the Christian Church has not entirely perished.] 
And it seems that this Baalitic worship will endure as long as the reign of the Pope, 
until Christ will come to judge, and by the glory of His advent destroy the reign 
of Antichrist. Meanwhile all who truly believe the Gospel [that they may truly 
honor God and have a constant comfort against sins; for God has graciously caused 
His Gospel to shine, that we might be warned and saved] ought to condemn these 
wicked services, devised, contrary to God’s command, in order to obscure the glory 
of Christ and the righteousness of faith.
99] We have briefly said these things of the Mass in order that all good men in 
all parts of the world may be able to understand that with the greatest zeal we 
maintain the dignity of the Mass and show its true use, and that we have the most 
just reasons for dissenting from the adversaries. And we would have all good men 
admonished not to aid the adversaries in the profanation of the Mass, lest they 
burden themselves with other men’s sin. It is a great cause and a great subject, not 
inferior to the transaction of the prophet Elijah, who condemned the worship of 
Baal. We have presented a case of such importance with the greatest moderation, 
and now reply without casting any reproach. But if the adversaries will compel 
us to collect all kinds of abuses of the Mass, the case will not be treated with such 
forbearance.

Article XXVII: (XIII): Of Monastic Vows.
1] In the town of Eisenach, in Thuringia, there was, to our knowledge, a monk, 
John Hilten, who, thirty years ago, was cast by his fraternity into prison because he 
had protested against certain most notorious abuses. For we have seen his writings, 
from which it can be well understood what the nature of his doctrine was [that he 
was a Christian, and preached according to the Scriptures]. And those who knew 
him testify that he was a mild old man, and serious indeed, 2] but without morose-
ness. He predicted many things, some of which have thus far transpired, and others 
still seem to impend, which we do not wish to recite, lest it may be inferred that 
they are narrated either from hatred toward one or from partiality to another. But 
finally, when, either on account of his age or the foulness of the prison, he fell into 
disease, he sent for the guardian in order to tell him of his sickness; and when the 
guardian, inflamed with pharisaic hatred, had begun to reprove the man harshly 
on account of his kind of doctrine, which seemed to be injurious to the kitchen, 
then, omitting all mention of his sickness, he said with a sigh that he was bearing 
these injuries patiently for Christ’s sake, since he had indeed neither written nor 
taught anything which could overthrow the position of the monks, but had only 
protested against some well-known abuses. 3] But another one, he said, will come in 
A. D. 1516, who will destroy You, neither will you be able to resist him. This very opinion 
concerning the downward career of the power of the monks, and this number of 
years, his friends afterwards found also written by him in his commentaries, which 
he had left, concerning certain passages of Daniel. 4] But although the outcome 
will teach how much weight should be given to this declaration, yet there are 
other signs which threaten a change in the power of the monks, that are no less 
certain than oracles. For it is evident how much hypocrisy, ambition, avarice there 
is in the monasteries, how much ignorance and cruelty among all the unlearned, 
what vanity in their sermons and in devising continually new means of gaining 
money. [The more stupid asses the monks are, the more stubborn, furious, bitter, 
the more venomous asps they are in persecuting the truth and the Word of God.] 
5] And there are other faults, which we do not care to mention. While they once 
were [not jails or everlasting prisons, but] schools for Christian instruction, now 
they have degenerated, as though from a golden to an iron age, or as the Platon-
ic cube degenerates into bad harmonies, which, Plato says, brings destruction. 
[Now this precious gold is turned to dross, and the wine to water.] All the most 
wealthy monasteries support only an idle crowd, which gluttonizes upon 6] the 
public alms of the Church. Christ, however, teaches concerning the salt that has lost 
its savor that it should be cast out and be trodden under foot, Matt. 5:13. Therefore 7] the 
monks by such morals are singing their own fate [requiem, and it will soon be over 
with them]. And now another sign is added, because they are, in many places, the 
instigators of the death of good men. [This blood of Abel cries against them and] 
The Lutheran Confessions
242
These murders God undoubtedly will shortly avenge. 8] Nor indeed do we find 
fault with all; for we are of the opinion that there are here and there some good 
men in the monasteries who judge moderately concerning human and factitious 
services, as some writers call them, and who do not approve of the cruelty which 
the hypocrites among them exercise.
9] But we are now discussing the kind of doctrine which the composers of the 
Confutation are now defending, and not the question whether vows should be 
observed. For we hold that lawful vows ought to be observed; but whether these 
services merit the remission of sins and justification; whether they are satisfactions 
for sins; whether they are equal to Baptism; whether they are the observance of 
precepts and counsels; whether they are evangelical perfection; whether they have 
the merits of supererogation; whether these merits, when applied on behalf of 
others, save them; whether vows made with these opinions are lawful; whether 
vows are lawful that are undertaken under the pretext of religion, merely for 
the sake of the belly and idleness; whether those are truly vows that have been 
extorted either from the unwilling, or from those who on account of age were not 
able to judge concerning the kind of life, whom parents or friends thrust into the 
monasteries that they might be supported at the public expense, without the loss 
of private patrimony; whether vows are lawful that openly tend to an evil issue, 
either because on account of weakness they are not observed, or because those 
who are in these fraternities are compelled 10] to approve and aid the abuses of 
the Mass, the godless worship of saints, and the counsels to rage against good men: 
concerning these questions we are treating. And although we have said very many 
things in the Confession concerning such vows as even the canons of the Popes 
condemn, nevertheless the adversaries command that all things which we have 
produced be rejected. For they have used these words.
And it is worth while to hear how they pervert our reasons, and what they adduce 
to fortify their own cause. Accordingly, we will briefly run over a few of our argu-
ments, and, in passing, explain away the sophistry of the adversaries in reference 
to them. Since, however, this entire cause has been carefully and fully treated by 
Luther in the book to which he gave the title De Votis Monasticis, we wish here to 
consider that book as reiterated.
11] First, it is very certain that a vow is not lawful by which he who vows thinks 
that he merits the remission of sins before God, or makes satisfaction before God 
for sins. For this opinion is a manifest insult to the Gospel, which teaches that 
the remission of sins is freely granted us for Christ’s sake, as has been said above 
at some length. Therefore we have correctly quoted the declaration of Paul to the 
Galatians, Gal. 5:4: Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
243
justified by the Law; ye are fallen from grace. Those who seek the remission of sins, 
not by faith in Christ, but by monastic works, detract from the honor of Christ, 
and crucify Christ afresh. But hear, hear how the composers of the Confutation 
escape in this place! 12] They explain this passage of Paul only concerning the Law 
of Moses, and they add that the monks observe all things for Christ’s sake, and 
endeavor to live the nearer the Gospel in order to merit eternal life. And they add 
a horrible peroration in these words: Wherefore those things are wicked that are here 
13] alleged against monasticism. O Christ, how long wilt Thou bear these reproaches 
with which our enemies treat Thy Gospel? We have said in the Confession that 
the remission of sins is received freely for Christ’s sake, through faith. If this is not 
the very voice of the Gospel, if it is not the judgment of the eternal Father, which 
Thou who art in the bosom of the Father hast revealed to the world, we are justly 
blamed. But Thy death is a witness, Thy resurrection is a witness, the Holy Ghost is 
a witness, Thy entire Church is a witness, that it is truly the judgment of the Gos-
pel that we obtain remission of sins, not on account of our merits, but on account 
of Thee, through faith.
14] When Paul denies that by the Law of Moses men merit the remission of sins, 
he withdraws this praise much more from human traditions; and this he clearly 
testifies Col. 2:16. If the Law of Moses, which was divinely revealed, did not merit 
the remission of sins, how much less do these silly observances [monasticism, rosa-
ries, etc.], averse to the civil custom of life, merit the remission of sins!
15] The adversaries feign that Paul abolishes the Law of Moses, and that Christ 
succeeds in such a way that He does not freely grant the remission of sins, but on 
account of the works of other laws, if any 16] are now devised. By this godless and 
fanatical imagination they bury the benefit of Christ. Then they feign that among 
those who observe this Law of Christ, the monks observe it more closely than 
others, on account of their hypocritical poverty, obedience, and chastity, since 
indeed all these things are full of sham. In the greatest abundance of all things 
they boast of poverty. Although no class of men has greater license than the monks 
[who have masterfully decreed that they are exempt from obedience to bishops and 
princes], they boast of obedience. Of celibacy we do not like to speak; how pure 
this is in most of those who desire to be continent, Gerson indicates. And how 
many of them desire to be continent [not to mention the thoughts of their hearts]?
17] Of course, in this sham life the monks live more closely in accordance with the 
Gospel! Christ does not succeed Moses in such a way as to remit sins on account 
of our works, but so as to set His own merits and His own propitiation on our 
behalf against God’s wrath, that we may be freely forgiven. Now, he who, apart 
from Christ’s propitiation, opposes his own merits to God’s wrath, and on account 
The Lutheran Confessions
244
of his own merits endeavors to obtain the remission of sins, whether he present the 
works of the Mosaic Law, or of the Decalog, or of the rule of Benedict, or of the 
rule of Augustine, or of other rules, annuls the promise of Christ, has cast away Christ, 
and has fallen from grace. This is the verdict of Paul.
18] But, behold, most clement Emperor Charles, behold, ye princes, behold, all ye 
ranks, how great is the impudence of the adversaries! Although we have cited the 
declaration of Paul to this effect, they have written: Wicked are those things that are 
here cited against monasticism. But what 19] is more certain than that men obtain 
the remission of sins by faith for Christ’s sake? And these wretches dare to call this 
a wicked opinion! We do not at all doubt that if you had been advised of this pas-
sage, you would have taken [will take] care that such blasphemy be removed from 
the Confutation.
But since it has been fully shown above that the opinion 20] is wicked, that we 
obtain the remission of sins on account of our works, we shall be briefer at this 
place. For the prudent reader will easily be able to reason thence that we do not 
merit the remission of sins by monastic works. Therefore this blasphemy also is in 
no way to be endured which is read in Thomas, that the monastic profession is equal to 
Baptism. It is madness to make human tradition, which has neither God’s command 
nor promise, equal to the ordinance of Christ, which has both the command and 
promise of God, which contains the covenant of grace and of eternal life.
21] Secondly. Obedience, poverty, and celibacy, provided the latter is not impure, 
are, as exercises, adiaphora [in which we are not to look for either sin or righteous-
ness]. And for this reason the saints can use these without impiety, just as Bernard, 
Franciscus, and other holy men used them. And they used them on account of 
bodily advantage, that they might have more leisure to teach and to perform other 
godly offices, and not that the works themselves are, by themselves, works that jus-
tify or merit eternal life. Finally, they belong to the class of which Paul says, 1 Tim. 
4:8: Bodily exercise 22] profiteth little. And it is credible that in some places there 
are also at present good men, engaged in the ministry of the Word, who use these 
observances without wicked opinions [without hypocrisy and with the understand-
ing that they do not regard their monasticism as holiness]. 23] But to hold that 
these observances are services on account of which they are accounted just before 
God, and through which they merit eternal life, conflicts with the Gospel concern-
ing the righteousness of faith, which teaches that for Christ’s sake righteousness 
and eternal life are granted us. It conflicts also with the saying of Christ, Matt. 15:9: 
In vain do they worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. It 
conflicts also with this statement, Rom. 14:23: Whatsoever is not of faith is sin. But 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
245
how can they affirm that they are services which God approves as righteousness 
before Him when they have no testimony of God’s Word?
24] But look at the impudence of the adversaries! They not only teach that these 
observances are justifying services, but they add that these services are more 
perfect, i.e., meriting more the remission of sins and justification, than do other 
kinds of life [that they are states of perfection, i.e., holier and higher states than 
the rest, such as marriage, rulership]. And here many false and pernicious opinions 
concur. They imagine that they [are the most holy people who] observe [not only] 
precepts and [but also] counsels [that is, the superior counsels, which Scripture 
issues concerning exalted gifts, not by way of command, but of advice]. Afterwards 
these liberal men, since they dream that they have the merits of supererogation, sell 
these 25] to others. All these things are full of pharisaic vanity. For it is the height 
of impiety to hold that they satisfy the Decalog in such a way that merits remain, 
while such precepts as these are accusing all the saints: Thou shalt love the Lord, 
thy God, with all thine heart, Deut. 6:5. Likewise: Thou shalt not covet, Rom. 7:7. 
[For as the First Commandment of God (Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with 
all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind) is higher than a man upon 
earth can comprehend, as it is the highest theology, from which all the prophets 
and all the apostles have drawn as from a spring their best and highest doctrines; 
yea, as it is such an exalted commandment, according to which alone all divine ser-
vice, all honor to God, every offering, all thanksgiving in heaven and upon earth, 
must be regulated and judged, so that all divine service, high and precious and holy 
though it appear, if it be not in accordance with this commandment, is nothing 
but husks and shells without a kernel, yea, nothing but filth and abomination 
before God; which exalted commandment no saint whatever has perfectly fulfilled, 
so that even Noah and Abraham, David, Peter and Paul acknowledged themselves 
imperfect and sinners: it is an unheard-of, pharisaic, yea, an actually diabolical 
pride for a sordid Barefooted monk or any similar godless hypocrite to say, yea, 
preach and teach, that he has observed and fulfilled the holy high commandment 
so perfectly, and according to the demands and will of God has done so many good 
works, that merit even superabounds to him. Yea, dear hypocrites, if the holy Ten 
Commandments and the exalted First Commandment of God were fulfilled as 
easily as the bread and remnants are put into the sack! They are shameless hyp-
ocrites with whom the world is plagued in this last time.] The prophet says, Ps. 
116:11: All men are liars, i.e., not thinking aright concerning God, not fearing God 
sufficiently, not believing Him sufficiently. Therefore the monks falsely boast that 
in the observance of a monastic life the commandments are fulfilled, and more is 
done than what is commanded [that their good works and several hundred-weights 
of superfluous, superabundant holiness remain in store for them].
The Lutheran Confessions
246
26] Again, this also is false, namely, that monastic observances are works of the 
counsels of the Gospel. For the Gospel does not advise concerning distinctions of 
clothing and meats and the renunciation of property. These are human traditions, 
concerning all of which it has been said, 1 Cor. 8:8: Meat commendeth us not to 
God. Therefore they are neither justifying services nor perfection; yea, when they 
are presented covered with these titles, they are mere doctrines of demons.
27] Virginity is recommended, but to those who have the gift, as has been said 
above. It is, however, a most pernicious error to hold that evangelical perfection 
lies in human traditions. For thus the monks even of the Mohammedans would 
be able to boast that they have evangelical perfection. Neither does it lie in the 
observance of other things which are called adiaphora, but because the kingdom 
of God is righteousness and life in hearts, Rom. 14:17, perfection is growth in the 
fear of God, and in confidence in the mercy promised in Christ, and in devotion to 
one’s calling; just as Paul also describes perfection 2 Cor. 3:18: We are changed from 
glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. He does not say: We are contin-
ually receiving another hood, or other sandals, or other girdles. It is deplorable 
that in the Church such pharisaic, yea, Mohammedan expressions should be read 
and heard as, that the perfection of the Gospel, of the kingdom of Christ, which 
is eternal life, should be placed in these foolish observances of vestments and of 
similar trifles.
28] Now hear our Areopagites [excellent teachers] as to what an unworthy 
declaration they have recorded in the Confutation. Thus they say: It has been 
expressly declared in the Holy Scriptures that the monastic life merits eternal life if 
maintained by a due observance, which by the grace of God any monk can maintain; and, 
indeed, Christ has promised this as much more abundant to those who have left home 
or brothers, etc., Matt. 19:29. 29] These are the words of the adversaries, in which 
it is first said most impudently that it is expressed in the Holy Scriptures that 
a monastic life merits eternal life. For where do the Holy Scriptures speak of a 
monastic life? Thus the adversaries plead their case, thus men of no account quote 
the Scriptures. Although no one is ignorant that the monastic life has recently 
been devised, nevertheless they cite the authority of Scripture, and say, too, that 
this their decree has been expressly declared in the Scriptures.
30] Besides, they dishonor Christ when they say that by monasticism men merit 
eternal life. God has ascribed not even to His Law the honor that it should merit 
eternal life, as He clearly says in Ezek. 20:25: I gave them also statutes that were 
not good, 31] and judgments whereby they should not live. In the first place, it 
is certain that a monastic life does not merit the remission of sins, but we obtain 
this by faith freely, as has been said above. 32] Secondly, for Christ’s sake, through 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
247
mercy, eternal life is granted to those who by faith receive remission, and do not 
set their own merits against God’s judgment, as Bernard also says with very great 
force: It is necessary first of all to believe that you cannot have the remission of sins unless 
by God’s indulgence. Secondly, that you can have no good work whatever, unless He has 
given also this. Lastly, that you can merit eternal life by no works, unless this also is given 
freely. The rest that follows to the same effect we have above recited. Moreover, 
Bernard adds at the end: Let no one deceive himself, because if he will reflect well, he will 
undoubtedly find that with ten thousand he cannot meet Him [namely, God] who cometh 
against him with twenty thousand. 33] Since, however, we do not merit the remission 
of sins or eternal life by the works of the divine Law, but it is necessary to seek the 
mercy promised in Christ, much less is this honor of meriting the remission of sins 
or eternal life to be ascribed to monastic observances, since they are mere human 
traditions.
34] Thus those who teach that the monastic life merits the remission of sins or 
eternal life, and transfer the confidence due Christ to these foolish observances, 
altogether suppress the Gospel concerning the free remission of sins and the 
promised mercy in Christ that is to be apprehended. Instead of Christ they 
worship their own hoods and their own filth. But since even they need mercy, 
they act wickedly in fabricating works of supererogation, and selling them [their 
superfluous claim upon heaven] to others.
35] We speak the more briefly concerning these subjects, because from those 
things which we have said above concerning justification, concerning repentance, 
concerning human traditions, it is sufficiently evident that monastic vows are 
not a price on account of which the remission of sins and life eternal are granted. 
And since Christ calls traditions useless services, they are in no way evangelical 
perfection.
36] But the adversaries cunningly wish to appear as if they modify the common 
opinion concerning perfection. They say that a monastic life is not perfection, but 
that it is a state in which to acquire perfection. It is prettily phrased! We remem-
ber that this correction is found in Gerson. For it is apparent that prudent men, 
offended by these immoderate praises of monastic life, since they did not venture 
to remove entirely from it the praise of perfection, have added the correction that 
it is a state in which to acquire perfection. 37] If we follow this, monasticism will 
be no more a state of perfection than the life of a farmer or mechanic. For these are 
also states in which to acquire perfection. For all men, in every vocation, ought to 
seek perfection, that is, to grow in the fear of God, in faith, in love towards one’s 
neighbor, and similar spiritual virtues.
The Lutheran Confessions
248
38] In the histories of the hermits there are examples of Anthony and of others 
which make the various spheres of life equal. It is written that when Anthony 
asked God to show him what progress he was making in this kind of life, a certain 
shoemaker in the city of Alexandria was indicated to him in a dream to whom he 
should be compared. The next day Anthony came into the city, and went to the 
shoemaker in order to ascertain his exercises and gifts, and, having conversed with 
the man, heard nothing except that early in the morning he prayed in a few words 
for the entire state, and then attended to his trade. Here Anthony learned that 
justification is not to be ascribed to the kind of life which he had entered [what 
God had meant by the revelation; for we are justified before God not through this 
or that life, but alone through faith in Christ].
39] But although the adversaries now moderate their praises concerning perfection, 
yet they actually think otherwise. For they sell merits, and apply them on behalf of 
others, under the pretext that they are observing precepts and counsels; hence they 
actually hold that they have superfluous merits. But what is it to arrogate to one’s 
self perfection, if this is not? Again, it has been laid down in the Confutation that 
the monks endeavor to live more nearly in accordance with the Gospel. Therefore 
it ascribes perfection to human traditions if they are living more nearly in accor-
dance with the Gospel by not having property, being unmarried, and obeying the 
rule in clothing, meats, and like trifles.
40] Again, the Confutation says that the monks merit eternal life the more 
abundantly, and quotes Scripture, Matt. 19:29: Every one that hath forsaken houses, 
etc. Accordingly, here, too, it claims perfection also for factitious religious rites. 
But this passage of Scripture in no way favors monastic life. For Christ does not 
mean that to forsake parents, wife, brethren, is a work that must be done because 
it merits the remission of sins and eternal life. Yea, such a forsaking is cursed. For if 
any one forsakes parents or wife in order by this very work to merit the remission 
of sins or eternal life, this is done with dishonor to Christ.
41] There is, moreover, a two-fold forsaking. One occurs without a call, without 
God’s command; this Christ does not approve, Matt. 15:9. For the works chosen 
by us are useless services. But that Christ does not approve this flight appears the 
more clearly from the fact that He speaks of forsaking wife and children. We know, 
however, that God’s commandment forbids the forsaking of wife and children. The 
forsaking which occurs by God’s command is of a different kind, namely, when 
power or tyranny compels us either to depart or to deny the Gospel. Here we have 
the command that we should rather bear injury, that we should rather suffer not 
only wealth, wife, and children, but even life, to be taken from us. This forsaking 
Christ approves, and accordingly He adds: For the Gospel’s sake, Mark 10:29, in or-
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
249
der to signify that He is speaking not of those who do injury to wife and children, 
but who bear injury on account of the confession of the Gospel. 42] For the Gos-
pel’s sake we ought even to forsake our body. Here it would be ridiculous to hold 
that it would be a service to God to kill one’s self, and without God’s command to 
leave the body. So, too, it is ridiculous to hold that it is a service to God without 
God’s command to forsake possessions, friends, wife, children.
43] Therefore it is evident that they wickedly distort Christ’s word to a monastic 
life. Unless perhaps the declaration that they “receive a hundredfold in this life” 
be in place here. For very many become monks not on account of the Gospel, but 
on account of sumptuous living and idleness, who find 44] the most ample riches 
instead of slender patrimonies. But as the entire subject of monasticism is full of 
shams, so, by a false pretext, they quote testimonies of Scripture, and as a conse-
quence they sin doubly, i.e., they deceive men, and that, too, under the pretext of 
the divine name.
45] Another passage is also cited concerning perfection Matt. 19:21: If thou wilt be 
perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and come and follow Me. 
This passage has exercised many, who have imagined that it is perfection to cast 
away possessions and the control of property. 46] Let us allow the philosophers to 
extol Aristippus, who cast a great weight of gold into the sea. [Cynics like Dio-
genes, who would have no house, but lay in a tub, may commend such heathenish 
holiness.] Such examples pertain in no way to Christian perfection. [Christian ho-
liness consists in much higher matters than such hypocrisy.] The division, control, 
and possession of property are civil ordinances, approved by God’s Word in the 
commandment, Ex. 20:15: Thou shalt not steal. The abandonment of property has 
no command or advice in the Scriptures. For evangelical poverty does not consist 
in the abandonment of property, but in not being avaricious, in not trusting in 
wealth, just as David was poor in a most wealthy kingdom.
47] Therefore, since the abandonment of property is merely a human tradition, 
it is a useless service. Excessive also are the praises in the Extravagant, which says 
that the abdication of the ownership of all things for God’s sake is meritorious and 
holy, and a way of perfection. And it is very dangerous to extol with such excessive 
praises a matter conflicting with political order. [When inexperienced people hear 
such commendations, they conclude that it is unchristian to hold property; whence 
many errors and seditions follow; through such commendations Muentzer was 
deceived, and thereby many Anabaptists were led astray.] 48] But [they say] Christ 
here speaks of perfection. Yea, they do violence to the text who quote it mutilated. 
Perfection is in that which Christ adds: 49] Follow Me. An example of obedience in 
one’s calling is here presented. And as callings are unlike [one is called to rulership, 
The Lutheran Confessions
250
a second to be father of a family, a third to be a preacher], so this calling does not 
belong to all, but pertains properly to that person with whom Christ there speaks, 
just as the call of David to the kingdom, and of Abraham to slay his son, are not to 
be imitated by us. Callings are personal, just as matters of business themselves vary 
with times and persons; but the example of obedience is general. 50] Perfection 
would have belonged to that young man if he had believed and obeyed this 
vocation. Thus perfection with us is that every one with true faith should obey his 
own calling. [Not that I should undertake a strange calling for which I have not the 
commission or command of God.]
51] Thirdly. In monastic vows chastity is promised. We have said above, however, 
concerning the marriage of priests, that the law of nature [or of God] in men can-
not be removed by vows or enactments. And as all do not have the gift of conti-
nence, many because of weakness are unsuccessfully continent. Neither, indeed, 
can any vows or any enactments abolish the command of the Holy Ghost, 1 Cor. 
7:2: To avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife. Therefore this vow is not 
lawful in those who do not have the gift of continence, but who are polluted on 
account of weakness. 52] Concerning this entire topic enough has been said above, 
in regard to which indeed it is strange, since the dangers and scandals are occur-
ring before men’s eyes, that the adversaries still defend their traditions contrary 
to the manifest command of God. Neither does the voice of Christ move them, 
who chides the Pharisees, Matt. 23:13f , who had made traditions contrary to God’s 
command.
53] Fourthly. Those who live in monasteries are released from their vows by such 
godless ceremonies as of the Mass applied on behalf of the dead for the sake of 
gain; the worship of saints, in which the fault is twofold, both that the saints are 
put in Christ’s place, and that they are wickedly worshiped, just as the Domini-
casters invented the rosary of the Blessed Virgin, which is mere babbling, not less 
foolish than it is wicked, and nourishes the most vain presumption. Then, too, 
these very impieties are applied only for the sake of 54] gain. Likewise, they neither 
hear nor teach the Gospel concerning the free remission of sins for Christ’s sake, 
concerning the righteousness of faith, concerning true repentance, concerning 
works which have God’s command. But they are occupied either in philosophic 
discussions or in the handing down of ceremonies that obscure Christ.
55] We will not here speak of the entire service of ceremonies, of the lessons, 
singing, and similar things, which could be tolerated if they [were regulated as 
regards number, and if they] would be regarded as exercises, after the manner 
of lessons in the schools [and preaching], whose design is to teach the hearers, 
and, while teaching, to move some to fear or faith. But now they feign that these 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
251
ceremonies are services of God, which merit the remission of sins for themselves 
and for others. For on this account they increase these ceremonies. But if they 
would undertake them in order to teach and exhort the hearers, brief and pointed 
lessons would be of more profit than these infinite babblings. 56] Thus the entire 
monastic life is full of hypocrisy and false opinions [against the First and Second 
Commandments, against Christ]. To all these this danger also is added, that those 
who are in these fraternities are compelled to assent to those persecuting the truth. 
There are, therefore, many important and forcible reasons which free good men 
from the obligation to this kind of life.
57] Lastly, the canons themselves release many, who either without judgment [be-
fore they have attained a proper age] have made vows when enticed by the tricks of 
the monks, or have made vows under compulsion by friends. Such vows not even 
the canons declare to be vows. From all these considerations it is apparent that 
there are very many reasons which teach that monastic vows such as have hitherto 
been made are not vows; and for this reason a sphere of life full of hypocrisy and 
false opinions can be safely abandoned.
58] Here they present an objection derived from the Law concerning the Nazarites, 
Num. 6:2f. But the Nazarites did not take upon themselves their vows with the 
opinions which, we have hitherto said, we censure in the vows of the monks. The 
rite of the Nazarites was an exercise [a bodily exercise with fasting and certain 
kinds of food] or declaration of faith before men, and did not merit the remission 
of sins before God, did not justify before God. [For they sought this elsewhere, 
namely, in the promise of the blessed Seed.] Again, just as circumcision or the 
slaying of victims would not be a service of God now, so the rite of the Nazarites 
ought not to be presented now as a service, but it ought to be judged simply as an 
adiaphoron. It is not right to compare monasticism, devised without God’s Word, 
as a service which should merit the remission of sins and justification, with the rite 
of the Nazarites, which had God’s Word, and was not taught for the purpose of 
meriting the remission of sins, but to be an outward exercise, just as other ceremo-
nies of the Law. The same can be said concerning other ceremonies prescribed in 
the Law.
59] The Rechabites also are cited, who did not have any possessions, and did not 
drink wine, as Jeremiah 35:6f says. Yea, truly, the example of the Rechabites accords 
beautifully with our monks, whose monasteries excel the palaces of kings, and 
who live most sumptuously! And the Rechabites, in their poverty of all things, 
were nevertheless married. Our monks, although abounding in all voluptuousness, 
profess celibacy.
The Lutheran Confessions
252
60] Besides, examples ought to be interpreted according to the rule, i.e., according 
to certain and clear passages of Scripture, not contrary to the rule, that is, contrary 
to the Scriptures. 61] It is very certain, however, that our observances do not merit 
the remission of sins or justification. Therefore, when the Rechabites are praised, it 
is necessary [it is certain] that these have observed their custom, not because they 
believed that by this they merited remission of sins, or that the work was itself a 
justifying service, or one on account of which they obtained eternal life, instead 
of, by God’s mercy, for the sake of the promised Seed. But because they had the 
command of their parents, their obedience is praised, concerning which there is 
the commandment of God: Honor thy father and mother.
62] Then, too, the custom had a particular purpose: Because they were foreigners, 
not Israelites, it is apparent that their father wished to distinguish them by 
certain marks from their countrymen, so that they might not relapse into the 
impiety of their countrymen. He wished by these marks to admonish them of the 
[fear of God, the] doctrine of faith and immortality. 63] Such an end is lawful. 
But for monasticism far different ends are taught. They feign that the works of 
monasticism are a service; they feign that they merit the remission of sins and 
justification. The example of the Rechabites is therefore unlike monasticism; to 
omit here other evils which inhere in monasticism at present.
64] They cite also from 1 Tim. 5:11ff concerning widows, who, as they served the 
Church, were supported at the public expense, where it is said: They will marry, 
having damnation, because 65] they have cast off their first faith. First, let us 
suppose that the Apostle is here speaking of vows [which, however, he is not 
doing]; still this passage will not favor monastic vows, which are made concerning 
godless services, and in this opinion, that they merit the remission of sins and 
justification. For Paul, with ringing voice, condemns all services, all laws, all works, 
if they are observed in order to merit the remission of sins, or that, on account 
of them, instead of through mercy on account of Christ, we obtain remission of 
sins. On this account the vows of widows, if there were any, must have been unlike 
monastic vows.
66] Besides, if the adversaries do not cease to misapply the passage to vows, the 
prohibition that no widow be selected who is less than sixty years, 1 Tim. 5:9, must 
be misapplied in the same way. Thus vows 67] made before this age will be of no 
account. But the Church did not yet know these vows. Therefore Paul condemns 
widows, not because they marry, for he commands the younger to marry; but 
because, when supported at the public expense, they became wanton, and thus cast 
off faith. He calls this first faith, clearly not in a monastic vow, but in Christianity 
(of their Baptism, their Christian duty, their Christianity]. And in this sense he 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
253
understands faith in the same chapter, 5:8: If any one provide not for his own, and 
specialty for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith. 68] For he speaks 
otherwise of faith than the sophists. He does not ascribe faith to those who have 
mortal sin. He, accordingly, says that those cast off faith who do not care for their 
relatives. And in the same way he says that wanton women cast off faith.
69] We have recounted some of our reasons, and, in passing, have explained away 
the objections urged by the adversaries. And we have collected these matters, not 
only on account of the adversaries, but much more on account of godly minds, that 
they may have in view the reasons why they ought to disapprove of hypocrisy and 
fictitious monastic services, all of which indeed this one saying of Christ annuls, 
which reads, Matt. 15:9: In vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the 
commandments of men. Therefore the vows themselves and the observances of 
meats, lessons, chants, vestments, sandals, girdles, are useless services in God’s 
sight. And all godly minds should certainly know that the opinion is simply 
pharisaic and condemned that these observances merit the remission of sins; that 
on account of them we are accounted righteous; that on account of them, and not 
through mercy on account of Christ, we obtain eternal life. And the holy men who 
have lived in these kinds of life must necessarily have learned, confidence in such 
observance having been rejected, that they had the remission of sins freely; that for 
Christ’s sake through mercy they would obtain eternal life, and not for the sake 
of these services [therefore godly persons who were saved and continued to live in 
monastic life had finally come to this, namely, that they despaired of their monas-
tic life, despised all their works as dung, condemned all their hypocritical service of 
God, and held fast to the promise of grace in Christ, as in the example of St. Ber-
nard, saying, Perdite vixi, I have lived in a sinful way]; because God only approves 
services instituted by His Word, which services avail when used in faith.
Article XXVIII (XIV): Of Ecclesiastical Power.
1] Here the adversaries cry out violently concerning the privileges and immunities 
of the ecclesiastical estate, and they add the peroration: All things are vain which 
are presented in the present article against the immunity of the churches and priests. 2] 
This is mere calumny; for in this article we have disputed concerning other things. 
Besides, we have frequently testified that we do not find fault with political 
ordinances, and the gifts and privileges granted by princes.
3] But would that the adversaries would hear, on the other hand, the complaints 
of the churches and of godly minds! The adversaries courageously guard their own 
dignities and wealth; meanwhile, they neglect the condition of the churches; they 
The Lutheran Confessions
254
do not care that the churches are rightly taught, and that the Sacraments are duly 
administered. To the priesthood they admit all kinds of persons indiscriminately. 
[They ordain rude asses; thus the Christian doctrine perished, because the Church 
was not supplied with efficient preachers.] Afterwards they impose intolerable 
burdens; as though they were delighted with the destruction of their fellowmen, 
they demand that their traditions be observed far more accurately than the Gospel. 
4] Now, in the most important and difficult controversies, concerning which the 
people urgently desire to be taught, in order that they may have something certain 
which they may follow, they do not release the minds which are most severely 
tortured with doubt; they only call to arms. Besides, in manifest matters [against 
manifest truth] they present decrees written in blood, which threaten horrible 
punishments to men unless they act clearly 5] contrary to God’s command. Here, 
on the other hand, you ought to see the tears of the poor, and hear the pitiable 
complaints of many good men, which God undoubtedly considers and regards, to 
whom one day you will render an account of your stewardship.
6] But although in the Confession we have in this article embraced various topics, 
the adversaries make no reply [act in true popish fashion], except that the bishops 
have the power of rule and coercive correction, in order to direct their subjects 
to the goal of eternal blessedness; and that the power of ruling requires the power 
to judge, to define, to distinguish and fix those things which are serviceable or 
conduce to the aforementioned end. These are the words of the Confutation, 
in which the adversaries teach us [but do not prove] that the bishops have the 
authority to frame laws (without the authority of the Gospel] useful for obtaining 
eternal life. The controversy is concerning this article.
7] [Regarding this matter we submit the following:] But we must retain in the 
Church this doctrine, namely, that we receive the remission of sins freely for 
Christ’s sake, by faith. We must also retain this doctrine, namely, that human tra-
ditions are useless services, and therefore neither sin nor righteousness should be 
placed in meat, drink, clothing, and like things, the use of which Christ wished to 
be left free, since He says, Matt. 15:11: Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth 
the man; and Paul, Rom. 14:17: The kingdom 8] of God is not meat and drink. 
Therefore the bishops have no right to frame traditions in addition to the Gospel, 
that they may merit the remission of sins, that they may be services which God is 
to approve as righteousness, and which burden consciences, as though it were a sin 
to omit them. All this is taught by that one passage in Acts 15:9, where the apostles 
say [Peter says] that hearts are purified by faith. And then they prohibit the im-
posing of a yoke, and show how great a danger this is, and enlarge upon the sin of 
those who burden the Church. Why tempt ye God? they say. By this thunderbolt our 
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
255
adversaries are in no way terrified, who defend by violence traditions and godless 
opinions.
For above they have also condemned Article XV, 9] in which we have stated that 
traditions do not merit the remission of sins, and they here say that traditions 
conduce to eternal life. Do they merit the remission of sins? Are they services 
which God approves as righteousness? Do they quicken hearts? 10] Paul to 
the Colossians 2:20ff, says that traditions do not profit with respect to eternal 
righteousness and eternal life; for the reason that food, drink, clothing and the like 
are things that perish with the using. But eternal life [which begins in this life inward-
ly by faith] is wrought in the heart by eternal things, i.e., by the Word of God and 
the Holy Ghost. Therefore let the adversaries explain how traditions conduce to 
eternal life.
11] Since, however, the Gospel clearly testifies that traditions ought not to be 
imposed upon the Church in order to merit the remission of sins; in order to be 
services which God shall approve as righteousness; in order to burden consciences, 
so that to omit them is to be accounted as sin, the adversaries will never be able to 
show that the bishops have the power to institute such services.
12] Besides, we have declared in the Confession what power the Gospel ascribes 
to bishops. Those who are now bishops do not perform the duties of bishops 
according to the Gospel; although, indeed, they may be bishops according to 
canonical polity, which we do not censure. But we are speaking of a bishop 
according to the Gospel. 13] And we are pleased with the ancient division of power 
into power of the order and power of jurisdiction [that is, the administration of the 
Sacraments and the exercise of spiritual jurisdiction]. Therefore the bishop has the 
power of the order, i.e., the ministry of the Word and Sacraments; he has also the 
power of jurisdiction, i.e., the authority to excommunicate those guilty of open 
crimes, and again to absolve them if they are converted and 14] seek absolution. 
But their power is not to be tyrannical, i.e., without a fixed law; nor regal, i.e., 
above law; but they have a fixed command and a fixed Word of God, according 
to which they ought to teach, and according to which they ought to exercise their 
jurisdiction. Therefore, even though they should have some jurisdiction, it does not 
follow that they are able to institute new services. For services pertain in no way to 
jurisdiction. And they have the Word, they have the command, how far they ought 
to exercise jurisdiction, namely, if any one would do anything contrary to that 
Word which they have received from Christ. [For the Gospel does not set up a rule 
independently of the Gospel; that is quite clear and certain.]
The Lutheran Confessions
256
15] Although in the Confession we also have added how far it is lawful for them 
to frame traditions, namely, not as necessary services, but so that there may be 
order in the Church, for the sake of tranquillity. And these traditions ought not 
to cast snares upon consciences, as though to enjoin necessary services; as Paul 
teaches when he says, Gal. 5:1: Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ 
hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. 16] The 
use of such ordinances ought therefore to be left free, provided that offenses be 
avoided, and that they be not judged to be necessary services; just as the apostles 
themselves ordained [for the sake of good discipline] very many things which have 
been changed with time. Neither did they hand them down in such a way that it 
would not be permitted to change them. For they did not dissent from their own 
writings, in which they greatly labor lest the Church be burdened with the opinion 
that human rites are necessary services.
17] This is the simple mode of interpreting traditions, namely, that we understand 
them not as necessary services, and nevertheless, for the sake of avoiding offenses, 
we should observe them in the proper place. 18] And thus many learned and great 
men in the Church have held. Nor do we see what can be said against this. For it is 
certain that the expression Luke 10:16: He that heareth you heareth Me, does not 
speak of traditions, but is chiefly directed against traditions. For it is not a manda-
tum cum libera (a bestowal of unlimited authority), as they call it, but it is a cautio 
de rato (a caution concerning something prescribed), namely, concerning the spe-
cial command [not a free, unlimited order and power, but a limited order namely, 
not to preach their own word, but God’s Word and the Gospel], i.e., the testimony 
given to the apostles, that we believe them with respect to the word of another, not 
their own. For Christ wishes to assure us, as was necessary, that we should know 
that the Word delivered by men is efficacious, and that no other word from heaven 
ought to be sought. 19] He that heareth you heareth Me, cannot be understood of 
traditions. For Christ requires that they teach in such a way that [by their mouth] 
He Himself be heard, because He says: He heareth Me. Therefore He wishes His 
own voice, His own Word, to be heard, not human traditions. Thus a saying which 
is most especially in our favor, and contains the most important consolation and 
doctrine, these stupid men pervert to the most trifling matters, the distinctions of 
food, vestments, and the like.
20] They quote also Heb. 13:17: Obey them that have the rule over you. This 
passage requires obedience to the Gospel. For it does not establish a dominion for 
the bishops apart from the Gospel. Neither should the bishops frame traditions 
contrary to the Gospel, or interpret their traditions contrary to the Gospel. And 
when they do this, obedience is prohibited, according to Gal. 1:9: If any man preach 
any other gospel, let him be accursed
The Defense of the Augsburg Confession
257
21] We make the same reply to Matt. 23:3: Whatsoever they bid you observe, that 
observe, because evidently a universal command is not given that we should receive 
all things [even contrary to God’s command and Word], since Scripture elsewhere, 
Acts 5:29, bids us obey God rather than men. When, therefore, they teach wicked 
things, they are not to be heard. But these are wicked things, namely, that human 
traditions are services of God, that they are necessary services, that they merit the 
remission of sins and eternal life.
22] They present, as an objection, the public offenses and commotions which have 
arisen under pretext of our doctrine. To 23] these we briefly reply. If all the scan-
dals be brought together, still the one article concerning the remission of sins, that 
for Christ’s sake through faith we freely obtain the remission of sins, 24] brings so 
much good as to hide all evils. And this, in the beginning, gained for Luther not 
only our favor, but also that of many who are now contending against us. “For for-
mer favor ceases, and mortals are forgetful,” says Pindar. Nevertheless, we neither 
desire to desert truth that is necessary to the Church, 25] nor can we assent to the 
adversaries in condemning it. For we ought to obey God rather than men. Those who 
in the beginning condemned manifest truth, and are now persecuting it with the 
greatest cruelty, will give an account for the schism that has been occasioned. Then, 
too, are there no scandals 26] among the adversaries? How much evil is there in the 
sacrilegious profanation of the Mass applied to gain! How great disgrace in celiba-
cy! But let us omit a comparison. 27] This is what we have replied to the Confuta-
tion for the time being. Now we leave it to the judgment of all the godly whether 
the adversaries are right in boasting that they have actually refuted our Confession 
from the Scriptures.
THE END.
[As regards the slander and complaint of the adversaries at the end of the Con-
futation, namely, that this doctrine is causing disobedience and other scandals, 
this is unjustly imputed to our doctrine. For it is evident that by this doctrine the 
authority of magistrates is most highly praised. Moreover, it is well known that in 
those localities where this doctrine is preached, the magistrates have hitherto, by 
the grace of God, been treated with all respect by the subjects.
But as to the want of unity and dissension in the Church, it is well known how 
these matters first happened, and who have caused the division, namely, the sellers 
of indulgences, who shamelessly preached intolerable lies, and afterwards con-
demned Luther for not approving of those lies, and besides, they again and again 
excited more controversies, so that Luther was induced to attack many other er-
The Lutheran Confessions
258
rors. But since our opponents would not tolerate the truth, and dared to promote 
manifest errors by force, it is easy to judge who is guilty of the schism. Surely, all 
the world, all wisdom, all power ought to yield to Christ and His holy Word. But 
the devil is the enemy of God, and therefore rouses all his might against Christ, to 
extinguish and suppress the Word of God. Therefore the devil with his members, 
setting himself against the Word of God, is the cause of the schism and want of 
unity. For we have most zealously sought peace, and still most eagerly desire it, pro-
vided only we are not forced to blaspheme and deny Christ. For God, the discerner 
of all men’s hearts, is our witness that we do not delight and have no joy in this 
awful disunion. On the other hand, our adversaries have so far not been willing to 
conclude peace without stipulating that we must abandon the saving doctrine of 
the forgiveness of sin by Christ without our merit, though Christ would be most 
foully blasphemed thereby.
And although, as is the custom of the world, it cannot be but that offenses have 
occurred in this schism through malice and by imprudent people; for the devil 
causes such offenses, to disgrace the Gospel; yet all this is of no account in view 
of the great comfort which this teaching has brought men, that for Christ’s sake, 
without our merit, we have forgiveness of sins and a gracious God. Again, that men 
have been instructed that forsaking secular estates and magistracies is not a divine 
worship, but that such estates and magistracies are pleasing to God, and to be 
engaged in them is a real holy work and divine service.
If we also were to narrate the offenses of the adversaries, which, indeed, we have 
no desire to do, it would be a terrible list: what an abominable, blasphemous fair 
the adversaries have made of the Mass; what unchaste living has been instituted by 
their celibacy; how the Popes have for more than 400 years been engaged in wars 
against the emperors, have forgotten the Gospel, and only sought to be emperors 
themselves, and to bring all Italy into their power; how they have juggled the 
possessions of the Church; how through their neglect many false teachings and 
forms of worship have been set up by the monks. Is not their worship of the saints 
manifest pagan idolatry? All their writers do not say one word concerning faith in 
Christ, by which forgiveness of sin is obtained; the highest degree of holiness they 
ascribe to human traditions; it is chiefly of these that they write and preach. More-
over, this, too, ought to be numbered with their offenses, that they clearly reveal 
what sort of a spirit is in them, because they are now putting to death so many 
innocent, pious people on account of Christian doctrine. But we do not now wish 
to say more concerning this; for these matters should be decided in accordance 
with God’s Word, regardless of the offenses on either side.

We hope that all Godfearing men will sufficiently see from this writing of ours 
that ours is the Christian doctrine and comforting and salutary to all godly men. 
Accordingly, we pray God to extend His grace to the end that His holy Gospel may 
be known and honored by all, for His glory, and for the peace, unity, and salvation 
of all of us. Regarding all these articles we offer to make further statements, if 
required.]
The Lutheran Confessions

The Smalcald Articles
Preface
1] Since Pope Paul III convoked a Council last year, to assemble at Mantua about 
Whitsuntide, and afterwards transferred it from Mantua, so that it is not yet 
known where he will or can fix it, and we on our part either had to expect that we 
would be summoned also to the Council or [to fear that we would] be condemned 
unsummoned, I was directed to compile and collect the articles of our doctrine 
[in order that it might be plain] in case of deliberation as to what and how far 
we would be both willing and able to yield to the Papists, and in what points we 
intended to persevere and abide to the end.
2] I have accordingly compiled these articles and presented them to our side. They 
have also been accepted and unanimously confessed by our side, and it has been 
resolved that, in case the Pope with his adherents should ever be so bold as serious-
ly and in good faith, without lying and cheating, to hold a truly free [legitimate] 
Christian Council (as, indeed, he would be in duty bound to do), they be publicly 
delivered in order to set forth the Confession of our Faith.
3] But though the Romish court is so dreadfully afraid of a free Christian Council, 
and shuns the light so shamefully, that it has [entirely] removed, even from those 
who are on its side, the hope that it will ever permit a free Council, much less that 
it will itself hold one, whereat, as is just, they [many Papists] are greatly offended 
and have no little trouble on that account [are disgusted with this negligence of 
the Pope], since they notice thereby that the Pope would rather see all Christen-
dom perish and all souls damned than suffer either himself or his adherents to be 
reformed even a little, and his [their] tyranny to be limited, nevertheless I have 
determined meanwhile to publish these articles in plain print, so that, should I die 
before there would be a Council (as I fully expect and hope, because the knaves 
who flee the light and shun the day take such wretched pains to delay and hinder 
the Council), those who live and remain after me may have my testimony and con-
fession to produce, in addition to the Confession which I have issued previously, 
whereby up to this time I have abided, and, by God’s grace, will abide.
4] For what shall I say? How shall I complain? I am still living, writing, preaching, 
and lecturing daily; [and] yet there are found such spiteful men, not only among 
the adversaries, but also false brethren that profess to be on our side, as dare to cite 
my writings and doctrine directly against myself, and let me look on and listen, 
although they know well that I teach otherwise, and as wish to adorn their venom

261
with my labor, and under my name to [deceive and] mislead the poor people. 
[Good God!] Alas! what first will happen when I am dead?
5] Indeed, I ought to reply to everything while I am still living. But, again, how 
can I alone stop all the mouths of the devil? especially of those (as they all are 
poisoned) who will not hear or notice what we write, but solely exercise themselves 
with all diligence how they may most shamefully pervert and corrupt our word in 
every letter. These I let the devil answer, or at last Gods wrath, as they deserve. 6] 
I often think of the good Gerson, who doubts whether anything good should be 
[written and] published. If it is not done, many souls are neglected who could be 
delivered; but if it is done, the devil is there with malignant, villainous tongues 
without number which envenom and pervert everything, so that nevertheless the 
fruit [the usefulness of the writings] is prevented. 7] Yet what they gain thereby 
is manifest. For while they have lied so shamefully against us and by means of lies 
wished to retain the people, God has constantly advanced His work, and been mak-
ing their following ever smaller and ours greater, and by their lies has caused and 
still causes them to be brought to shame.
8] I must tell a story. There was a doctor sent here to Wittenberg from France, who 
said publicly before us that his king was sure and more than sure, that among us 
there is no church, no magistrate, no married life, but all live promiscuously as cat-
tle, and each one does as he pleases. 9] Imagine now, how will those who by their 
writings have instilled such gross lies into the king and other countries as the pure 
truth, look at us on that day before the judgment-seat of Christ? Christ, the Lord 
and Judge of us all, knows well that they lie and have [always] lied, His sentence 
they in turn, must hear; that I know certainly. God convert to repentance those 
who can be converted! Regarding the rest it will be said, Woe, and, alas! eternally.
10] But to return to the subject. I verily desire to see a truly Christian Council [as-
sembled some time], in order that many matters and persons might be helped. Not 
that we need it, for our churches are now, through God’s grace, so enlightened and 
equipped with the pure Word and right use of the Sacraments, with knowledge of 
the various callings and of right works, that we on our part ask for no Council, and 
on such points have nothing better to hope or expect from a Council. But we see 
in the bishoprics everywhere so many parishes vacant and desolate that one’s heart 
would break, and yet neither the bishops nor canons care how the poor people live 
or die, for whom nevertheless Christ has died, and who are not permitted to hear 
Him speak with them as the true Shepherd with His sheep. 11] This causes me to 
shudder and fear that at some time He may send a council of angels upon Germany 
utterly destroying us, like Sodom and Gomorrah, because we so wantonly mock 
Him with the Council.
The Lutheran Confessions
262
12] Besides such necessary ecclesiastical affairs, there would be also in the political 
estate innumerable matters of great importance to improve. There is the disagree-
ment between the princes and the states; usury and avarice have burst in like a 
flood, and have become lawful [are defended with a show of right]; wantonness, 
lewdness, extravagance in dress, gluttony, gambling, idle display, with all kinds of 
bad habits and wickedness, insubordination of subjects, of domestics and laborers, 
of every trade, also the exactions [and most exorbitant selling prices] of the peas-
ants (and who can enumerate all?) have so increased that they cannot be rectified 
by ten Councils and twenty Diets. 13] If such chief matters of the spiritual and 
worldly estates as are contrary to God would be considered in the Council, they 
would have all hands so full that the child’s play and absurdity of long gowns [offi-
cial insignia], large tonsures, broad cinctures [or sashes], bishops’ or cardinals’ hats 
or maces, and like jugglery would in the mean time be forgotten. If we first had 
performed God’s command and order in the spiritual and secular estate, we would 
find time enough to reform food, clothing, tonsures, and surplices. But if we want 
to swallow such camels, and, instead, strain at gnats, let the beams stand and judge 
the motes, we also might indeed be satisfied with the Council.
14] Therefore I have presented few articles; for we have without this so many 
commands of God to observe in the Church, the state, and the family that we can 
never fulfil them. What, then, is the use, or what does it profit that many decrees 
and statutes thereon are made in the Council, especially when these chief matters 
commanded of God are neither regarded nor observed? Just as though He were 
bound to honor our jugglery as a reward of our treading His solemn command-
ments under foot. But our sins weigh upon us and cause God not to be gracious to 
us; for we do not repent, and, besides, wish to defend every abomination.
15] O Lord Jesus Christ, do Thou Thyself convoke a Council, and deliver Thy 
servants by Thy glorious advent! The Pope and his adherents are done for; they 
will have none of Thee. Do Thou, then, help us, who are poor and needy, who sigh 
to Thee, and beseech Thee earnestly, according to the grace which Thou hast given 
us, through Thy Holy Ghost, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and the Father, 
blessed forever. Amen. 
THE FIRST PART
Treats of the Sublime Articles Concerning the Divine Majesty, as:
I. That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three distinct persons in one divine essence and na-
ture, are one God, who has created heaven and earth.
The Smalcald Articles
263
II. That the Father is begotten of no one; the Son of the Father; the Holy Ghost proceeds 
from Father and Son.
III. That not the Father nor the Holy Ghost but the Son became man.
IV. That the Son became man in this manner, that He was conceived, without the coopera-
tion of man, by the Holy Ghost, and was born of the pure, holy [and always] Virgin Mary. 
Afterwards He suffered, died, was buried, descended to hell, rose from the dead, ascended to 
heaven, sits at the right hand of God, will come to judge the quick and the dead, etc., as the 
Creed of the Apostles, as well as that of St. Athanasius, and the Catechism in common use 
for children, teach.
Concerning these articles there is no contention or dispute, since we on both sides 
confess them. Therefore it is not necessary now to treat further of them. 
THE SECOND PART
Treats of the Articles which Refer to the Office and Work of Jesus Christ, or Our 
Redemption.
Article I: The first and chief article.
1] That Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, died for our sins, and was raised again for our 
justification, Rom. 4:25.
2] And He alone is the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world, John 1:29; 
and God has laid upon Him the iniquities of us all, Is. 53:6.
3] Likewise: All have sinned and are justified without merit [freely, and without their own 
works or merits] by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, in His blood, 
Rom. 3:23f
4] Now, since it is necessary to believe this, and it cannot be otherwise acquired or 
apprehended by any work, law, or merit, it is clear and certain that this faith alone 
justifies us as St. Paul says, Rom. 3:28: For we conclude that a man is justified by faith, 
without the deeds of the Law. Likewise 3:26: That He might be just, and the Justifier of him 
which believeth in Christ.
5] Of this article nothing can be yielded or surrendered [nor can anything be grant-
ed or permitted contrary to the same], even though heaven and earth, and whatev-
The Lutheran Confessions
264
er will not abide, should sink to ruin. For there is none other name under heaven, given 
among men whereby we must be saved, says Peter, Acts 4:12. And with His stripes we are 
healed, Is. 53:5. And upon this article all things depend which we teach and practice 
in opposition to the Pope, the devil, and the [whole] world. Therefore, we must be 
sure concerning this doctrine, and not doubt; for otherwise all is lost, and the Pope 
and devil and all things gain the victory and suit over us. 
Article II: Of the Mass.
1] That the Mass in the Papacy must be the greatest and most horrible abomina-
tion, as it directly and powerfully conflicts with this chief article, and yet above 
and before all other popish idolatries it has been the chief and most specious. For it 
has been held that this sacrifice or work of the Mass, even though it be rendered by 
a wicked [and abandoned] scoundrel, frees men from sins, both in this life and also 
in purgatory, while only the Lamb of God shall and must do this, as has been said 
above. Of this article nothing is to be surrendered or conceded, because the first 
article does not allow it.
2] If, perchance, there were reasonable Papists we might speak moderately and in 
a friendly way, thus: first, why they so rigidly uphold the Mass. For it is but a pure 
invention of men, and has not been commanded by God; and every invention of 
man we may [safely] discard, as Christ declares, Matt. 15:9: In vain do they worship 
Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
3] Secondly. It is an unnecessary thing, which can be omitted without sin and 
danger.
4] Thirdly. The Sacrament can be received in a better and more blessed way [more 
acceptable to God], (yea, the only blessed way), according to the institution of 
Christ. Why, then, do they drive the world to woe and [extreme] misery on account 
of a fictitious, unnecessary matter, which can be well obtained in another and 
more blessed way?
5] Let [care be taken that] it be publicly preached to the people that the Mass as 
men’s twaddle [commentitious affair or human figment] can be omitted without 
sin, and that no one will be condemned who does not observe it, but that he can be 
saved in a better way without the Mass. I wager [Thus it will come to pass] that the 
Mass will then collapse of itself, not only among the insane [rude] common people, 
but also among all pious, Christian, reasonable, God-fearing hearts; and that the 
more, when they would hear that the Mass is a [very] dangerous thing, fabricated 
and invented without the will and Word of God.
The Smalcald Articles
265
6] Fourthly. Since such innumerable and unspeakable abuses have arisen in the 
whole world from the buying and selling of masses, the Mass should by right be re-
linquished, if for no other purpose than to prevent abuses, even though in itself it 
had something advantageous and good. How much more ought we to relinquish it, 
so as to prevent [escape] forever these horrible abuses, since it is altogether unnec-
essary, useless, and dangerous, and we can obtain everything by a more necessary, 
profitable, and certain way without the Mass.
7] Fifthly. But since the Mass is nothing else and can be nothing else (as the Canon 
and all books declare), than a work of men (even of wicked scoundrels), by which 
one attempts to reconcile himself and others to God, and to obtain and merit the 
remission of sins and grace (for thus the Mass is observed when it is observed at the 
very best; otherwise what purpose would it serve?), for this very reason it must and 
should [certainly] be condemned and rejected. For this directly conflicts with the 
chief article, which says that it is not a wicked or a godly hireling of the Mass with 
his own work, but the Lamb of God and the Son of God, that taketh away our sins.
8] But if any one should advance the pretext that as an act of devotion he wishes 
to administer the Sacrament, or Communion, to himself, he is not in earnest [he 
would commit a great mistake, and would not be speaking seriously and sincerely]. 
For if he wishes to commune in sincerity, the surest and best way for him is in the 
Sacrament administered according to Christ’s institution. But that one adminis-
ter communion to himself is a human notion, uncertain, unnecessary, yea, even 
prohibited. And he does not know what he is doing, because without the Word of 
God he obeys a false human opinion and invention. 9] So, too, it is not right (even 
though the matter were otherwise correct) for one to use the common Sacrament 
of [belonging to] the Church according to his own private devotion, and without 
God’s Word and apart from the communion of the Church to trifle therewith.
10] This article concerning the Mass will be the whole business of the Council. [The 
Council will perspire most over, and be occupied with this article concerning the 
Mass.] For if it were [although it would be] possible for them to concede to us all 
the other articles, yet they could not concede this. As Campegius said at Augs-
burg that he would be torn to pieces before he would relinquish the Mass, so, by 
the help of God, I, too, would suffer myself to be reduced to ashes before I would 
allow a hireling of the Mass, be he good or bad, to be made equal to Christ Jesus, 
my Lord and Savior, or to be exalted above Him. Thus we are and remain eternally 
separated and opposed to one another. They feel well enough that when the Mass 
falls, the Papacy lies in ruins. Before they will permit this to occur, they will put us 
all to death if they can.
The Lutheran Confessions
266
11] In addition to all this, this dragon’s tail, [I mean] the Mass, has begotten a numerous 
vermin-brood of manifold idolatries.
12] First, purgatory. Here they carried their trade into purgatory by masses for 
souls, and vigils, and weekly, monthly, and yearly celebrations of obsequies, and 
finally by the Common Week and All Souls’ Day, by soul-baths so that the Mass 
is used almost alone for the dead, although Christ has instituted the Sacrament 
alone for the living. Therefore purgatory, and every solemnity, rite, and commerce 
connected with it, is to be regarded as nothing but a specter of the devil. For it 
conflicts with the chief article [which teaches] that only Christ, and not the works 
of men, are to help [set free] souls. Not to mention the fact that nothing has been 
[divinely] commanded or enjoined upon us concerning the dead. Therefore all this 
may be safely omitted, even if it were no error and idolatry.
13] The Papists quote here Augustine and some of the Fathers who are said to have 
written concerning purgatory, and they think that we do not understand for what 
purpose and to what end they spoke as they did. St. Augustine does not write that 
there is a purgatory, nor has he a testimony of Scripture to constrain him thereto, 
but he leaves it in doubt whether there is one, and says that his mother asked to 
be remembered at the altar or Sacrament. Now, all this is indeed nothing but the 
devotion of men, and that, too, of individuals, and does not establish an article of 
faith, which is the prerogative of God alone.
14] Our Papists, however, cite such statements [opinions] of men in order that men 
should believe in their horrible, blasphemous, and cursed traffic in masses for souls 
in purgatory [or in sacrifices for the dead and oblations], etc. But they will never 
prove these things from Augustine. Now, when they have abolished the traffic in 
masses for purgatory, of which Augustine never dreamt, we will then discuss with 
them whether the expressions of Augustine without Scripture [being without the 
warrant of the Word] are to be admitted, and whether the dead should be remem-
bered at the Eucharist. 15] For it will not do to frame articles of faith from the 
works or words of the holy Fathers; otherwise their kind of fare, of garments, of 
house, etc., would have to become an article of faith, as was done with relics. [We 
have, however, another rule, namely] The rule is: The Word of God shall establish 
articles of faith, and no one else, not even an angel.
16] Secondly. From this it has followed that evil spirits have perpetrated much 
knavery [exercised their malice] by appearing as the souls of the departed, and 
with unspeakable [horrible] lies and tricks demanded masses, vigils, pilgrimages, 
and other alms. 17] All of which we had to receive as articles of faith, and to live 
The Smalcald Articles
267
accordingly; and the Pope confirmed these things, as also the Mass and all other 
abominations. Here, too, there is no [cannot and must not be any] yielding or 
surrendering.
18] Thirdly. [Hence arose] the pilgrimages. Here, too, masses, the remission of sins 
and the grace of God were sought, for the Mass controlled everything. Now it is 
indeed certain that such pilgrimages, without the Word of God, have not been 
commanded us, neither are they necessary, since we can have these things [the soul 
can be cared for] in a better way, and can omit these pilgrimages without any sin 
and danger. Why therefore do they leave at home [desert] their own parish [their 
called ministers, their parishes], the Word of God, wives, children, etc., who are 
ordained and [attention to whom is necessary and has been] commanded, and run 
after these unnecessary, uncertain, pernicious will-o’-the-wisps of the devil [and er-
rors]? 19] Unless the devil was riding [made insane] the Pope, causing him to praise 
and establish these practices, whereby the people again and again revolted from 
Christ to their own works, and became idolaters, which is worst of all; moreover, 
it is neither necessary nor commanded, but is senseless and doubtful, and besides 
harmful. Hence here, too, there can be no yielding or surrendering [to yield or 
concede anything here is not lawful], etc. 20] And let this be preached, that such 
pilgrimages are not necessary, but dangerous; and then see what will become of 
them. [For thus they will perish of their own accord.]
21] Fourthly. Fraternities [or societies], in which cloisters, chapters, vicars have as-
signed and communicated (by a legal contract and sale) all masses and good works, 
etc., both for the living and the dead. This is not only altogether a human bauble, 
without the Word of God, entirely unnecessary and not commanded, but also con-
trary to the chief article, Of Redemption. Therefore it is in no way to be tolerated.
22] Fifthly. The relics, in which there are found so many falsehoods and tomfooler-
ies concerning the bones of dogs and horses, that even the devil has laughed at such 
rascalities, ought long ago to have been condemned, even though there were some 
good in them; and so much the more because they are without the Word of God; 
being neither commanded nor counseled, they are an entirely unnecessary and 
useless thing. 23] But the worst is that [they have imagined that] these relics had 
to work indulgence and the forgiveness of sins [and have revered them] as a good 
work and service of God, like the Mass, etc.
24] Sixthly. Here belong the precious indulgences granted (but only for money) 
both to the living and the dead, by which the miserable [sacrilegious and accursed] 
Judas, or Pope, has sold the merit of Christ, together with the superfluous merits 
of all saints and of the entire Church, etc. All these things [and every single one 
The Lutheran Confessions
268
of them] are not to be borne, and are not only without the Word of God, without 
necessity, not commanded, but are against the chief article. For the merit of Christ 
is [apprehended and] obtained not by our works or pence, but from grace through 
faith, without money and merit; and is offered [and presented] not through the 
power of the Pope, but through the preaching of God’s Word. 
Of the Invocation of Saints.
25] The invocation of saints is also one of the abuses of Antichrist conflicting with 
the chief article, and destroys the knowledge of Christ. Neither is it commanded 
nor counseled, nor has it any example [or testimony] in Scripture, and even though 
it were a precious thing, as it is not [while, on the contrary, it is a most harmful 
thing], in Christ we have everything a thousandfold better [and surer, so that we 
are not in need of calling upon the saints].
26] And although the angels in heaven pray for us (as Christ Himself also does), 
as also do the saints on earth, and perhaps also in heaven, yet it does not follow 
thence that we should invoke and adore the angels and saints, and fast, hold festi-
vals, celebrate Mass in their honor, make offerings, and establish churches, altars, 
divine worship, and in still other ways serve them, and regard them as helpers in 
need [as patrons and intercessors], and divide among them all kinds of help, and 
ascribe to each one a particular form of assistance, as the Papists teach and do. 
For this is idolatry, and such honor belongs alone to God. 27] For as a Christian 
and saint upon earth you can pray for me, not only in one, but in many necessi-
ties. But for this reason I am not obliged to adore and invoke you, and celebrate 
festivals, fast, make oblations, hold masses for your honor [and worship], and put 
my faith in you for my salvation. I can in other ways indeed honor, love, and thank 
you in Christ. 28] If now such idolatrous honor were withdrawn from angels and 
departed saints, the remaining honor would be without harm and would quickly 
be forgotten. For when advantage and assistance, both bodily and spiritual, are no 
more to be expected, the saints will not be troubled [the worship of the saints will 
soon vanish], neither in their graves nor in heaven. For without a reward or out of 
pure love no one will much remember, or esteem, or honor them [bestow on them 
divine honor].
29] In short, the Mass itself and anything that proceeds from it, and anything that 
is attached to it, we cannot tolerate, but must condemn, in order that we may 
retain the holy Sacrament pure and certain, according to the institution of Christ, 
employed and received through faith. 
The Smalcald Articles
269
Article III: Of Chapters and Cloisters.
1] That chapters and cloisters [colleges of canons and communistic dwellings], which 
were formerly founded with the good intention [of our forefathers] to educate 
learned men and chaste [and modest] women, ought again to be turned to such 
use, in order that pastors, preachers, and other ministers of the churches may be 
had, and likewise other necessary persons [fitted] for [the political administration 
of] the secular government [or for the commonwealth] in cities and countries, and 
well-educated, maidens for mothers and housekeepers, etc.
2] If they will not serve this purpose, it is better that they be abandoned or razed, 
rather than [continued and], with their blasphemous services invented by men, 
regarded as something better than the ordinary Christian life and the offices and 
callings ordained by God. For all this also is contrary to the first chief article 
concerning the redemption made through Jesus Christ. Add to this that (like all 
other human inventions) these have neither been commanded; they are needless 
and useless, and, besides, afford occasion for dangerous and vain labor [dangerous 
annoyances and fruitless worship], such services as the prophets call Aven, i.e., pain 
and labor. 
Article IV: Of the Papacy.
1] That the Pope is not, according to divine law or according to the Word of God the 
head of all Christendom (for this [name] belongs to One only, whose name is Jesus 
Christ), but is only the bishop and pastor of the Church at Rome, and of those 
who voluntarily or through a human creature (that is, a political magistrate) have 
attached themselves to him, to be Christians, not under him as a lord, but with 
him as brethren [colleagues] and comrades, as the ancient councils and the age of 
St. Cyprian show.
2] But to-day none of the bishops dare to address the Pope as brother as was done 
at that time [in the age of Cyprian]; but they must call him most gracious lord, 
even though they be kings or emperors. This [Such arrogance] we will not, cannot, 
must not take upon our conscience [with a good conscience approve]. Let him, 
however, who will do it, do so without us [at his own risk].
3] Hence it follows that all things which the Pope, from a power so false, mischie-
vous, blasphemous, and arrogant, has done and undertaken. have been and still 
are purely diabolical affairs and transactions (with the exception of such things 
as pertain to the secular government, where God often permits much good to be 
The Lutheran Confessions
270
effected for a people, even through a tyrant and [faithless] scoundrel) for the ruin 
of the entire holy [catholic or] Christian Church (so far as it is in his power) and 
for the destruction of the first and chief article concerning the redemption made 
through Jesus Christ.
4] For all his bulls and books are extant, in which he roars like a lion (as the angel 
in Rev. 12 depicts him, [crying out] that no Christian can be saved unless he obeys 
him and is subject to him in all things that he wishes, that he says, and that he 
does. All of which amounts to nothing less than saying: Although you believe in 
Christ, and have in Him [alone] everything that is necessary to salvation, yet it 
is nothing and all in vain unless you regard [have and worship] me as your god, 
and be subject and obedient to me. And yet it is manifest that the holy Church 
has been without the Pope for at least more than five hundred years, and that 
even to the present day the churches of the Greeks and of many other languages 
neither have been nor are yet under the Pope. 5] Besides, as often remarked, it is a 
human figment which is not commanded, and is unnecessary and useless; for the 
holy Christian [or catholic] Church can exist very well without such a head, and it 
would certainly have remained better [purer, and its career would have been more 
prosperous] if such a head had not been raised up by the devil. 6] And the Papacy is 
also of no use in the Church, because it exercises no Christian office; and therefore 
it is necessary for the Church to continue and to exist without the Pope.
7] And supposing that the Pope would yield this point, so as not to be supreme by 
divine right or from God’s command, but that we must have [there must be elect-
ed] a [certain] head, to whom all the rest adhere [as their support] in order that the 
[concord and] unity of Christians may be preserved against sects and heretics, and 
that such a head were chosen by men, and that it were placed within the choice 
and power of men to change or remove this head, just as the Council of Constance 
adopted nearly this course with reference to the Popes, deposing three and electing 
a fourth; supposing, I say, that the Pope and See at Rome would yield and accept 
this (which, nevertheless, is impossible; for thus he would have to suffer his entire 
realm and estate to be overthrown and destroyed, with all his rights and books, a 
thing which, to speak in few words, he cannot do), nevertheless, even in this way 
Christianity would not be helped, but many more sects would arise than before.
8] For since men would have to be subject to this head, not from God’s command, 
but from their personal good pleasure, it would easily and in a short time be de-
spised, and at last retain no member; neither would it have to be forever confined 
to Rome or any other place, but it might be wherever and in whatever church God 
would grant a man fit for the [taking upon him such a great] office. Oh, the com-
plicated and confused state of affairs [perplexity] that would result!
The Smalcald Articles
271
9] Therefore the Church can never be better governed and preserved than if we 
all live under one head, Christ, and all the bishops equal in office (although they 
be unequal in gifts), be diligently joined in unity of doctrine, faith, Sacraments, 
prayer, and works of love, etc., as St. Jerome writes that the priests at Alexandria 
together and in common governed the churches, as did also the apostles, and 
afterwards all bishops throughout all Christendom, until the Pope raised his head 
above all.
10] This teaching shows forcefully that the Pope is the very Antichrist, who has 
exalted himself above, and opposed himself against Christ because he will not 
permit Christians to be saved without his power, which, nevertheless, is nothing, 
and is neither ordained nor commanded by God. 11] This is, properly speaking to 
exalt himself above all that is called God as Paul says, 2 Thess. 2:4. Even the Turks or 
the Tartars, great enemies of Christians as they are, do not do this, but they allow 
whoever wishes to believe in Christ, and take bodily tribute and obedience from 
Christians.
12] The Pope, however, prohibits this faith, saying that to be saved a person must 
obey him. This we are unwilling to do, even though on this account we must die 
in God s name. 13] This all proceeds from the fact that the Pope has wished to 
be called the supreme head of the Christian Church by divine right. Accordingly 
he had to make himself equal and superior to Christ, and had to cause himself to 
be proclaimed the head and then the lord of the Church, and finally of the whole 
world, and simply God on earth, until he has dared to issue commands even to 
the angels in heaven. 14] And when we distinguish the Pope’s teaching from, or 
measure and hold it against, Holy Scripture, it is found [it appears plainly] that 
the Pope’s teaching, where it is best, has been taken from the imperial and hea-
then law, and treats of political matters and decisions or rights, as the Decretals 
show; furthermore, it teaches of ceremonies concerning churches, garments, food, 
persons and [similar] puerile, theatrical and comical things without measure, but 
in all these things nothing at all of Christ, faith, and the commandments of God. 
Lastly, it is nothing else than the devil himself, because above and against God he 
urges [and disseminates] his [papal] falsehoods concerning masses, purgatory, the 
monastic life, one’s own works and [fictitious] divine worship (for this is the very 
Papacy [upon each of which the Papacy is altogether founded and is standing]), 
and condemns, murders and tortures all Christians who do not exalt and honor 
these abominations [of the Pope] above all things. Therefore, just as little as we can 
worship the devil himself as Lord and God, we can endure his apostle, the Pope, 
or Antichrist, in his rule as head or lord. For to lie and to kill, and to destroy body 
and soul eternally, that is wherein his papal government really consists, as I have 
very clearly shown in many books.
The Lutheran Confessions
272
15] In these four articles they will have enough to condemn in the Council. For 
they cannot and will not concede us even the least point in one of these articles. 
Of this we should be certain, and animate ourselves with [be forewarned and made 
firm in] the hope that Christ, our Lord, has attacked His adversary, and he will 
press the attack home [pursue and destroy him] both by His Spirit and coming. 
Amen.
16] For in the Council we will stand not before the Emperor or the political 
magistrate, as at Augsburg (where the Emperor published a most gracious edict, 
and caused matters to be heard kindly [and dispassionately]), but [we will appear] 
before the Pope and devil himself, who intends to listen to nothing, but merely 
[when the case has been publicly announced] to condemn, to murder and to force 
us to idolatry. Therefore we ought not here to kiss his feet, or to say: “Thou art my 
gracious lord”, but as the angel in Zechariah 3:2 said to Satan: The Lord rebuke thee, 
O Satan. 
THE THIRD PART OF THE ARTICLES.
Concerning the following articles we may [will be able to] treat with learned and 
reasonable men, or among ourselves. The Pope and his [the Papal] government do 
not care much about these. For with them conscience is nothing, but money, [glo-
ry] honors, power are [to them] everything. 
Article I. Of Sin
1] Here we must confess, as Paul says in Rom. 5:12, that sin originated [and entered 
the world] from one man Adam, by whose disobedience all men were made sin-
ners, [and] subject to death and the devil. This is called original or capital sin.
2] The fruits of this sin are afterwards the evil deeds which are forbidden in the 
Ten Commandments, such as [distrust] unbelief, false faith, idolatry, to be without 
the fear of God, presumption [recklessness], despair, blindness [or complete loss 
of sight], and, in short not to know or regard God; furthermore to lie, to swear by 
[to abuse] God’s name [to swear falsely], not to pray, not to call upon God, not to 
regard [to despise or neglect] God’s Word, to be disobedient to parents, to murder, 
to be unchaste, to steal, to deceive, etc.
3] This hereditary sin is so deep [and horrible] a corruption of nature that no 
reason can understand it, but it must be [learned and] believed from the revelation 
The Smalcald Articles
273
of Scriptures, Ps. 51:5; Rom. 6:12ff; Ex. 33:3; Gen. 3:7ff Hence, it is nothing but error 
and blindness in regard to this article what the scholastic doctors have taught, 
namely:
4] That since the fall of Adam the natural powers of man have remained entire and 
incorrupt, and that man by nature has a right reason and a good will; which things the 
philosophers teach.
5] Again, that man has a free will to do good and omit evil, and, conversely, to omit good 
and do evil.
6] Again, that man by his natural powers can observe and keep [do] all the commands of 
God.
7] Again, that, by his natural powers, man can love God above all things and his neighbor 
as himself.
8] Again, if a man does as much as is in him, God certainly grants him His grace.
9] Again, if he wishes to go to the Sacrament, there is no need of a good intention to do 
good, but it is sufficient if he has not a wicked purpose to commit sin; so entirely good is his 
nature and so efficacious the Sacrament.
10] [Again,] that it is not founded upon Scripture that for a good work the Holy Ghost with 
His grace is necessary.
11] Such and many similar things have arisen from want of understanding and ig-
norance as regards both this sin and Christ, our Savior, and they are truly heathen 
dogmas, which we cannot endure. For if this teaching were right [approved], then 
Christ has died in vain, since there is in man no defect nor sin for which he should 
have died; or He would have died only for the body, not for the soul, inasmuch as 
the soul is [entirely] sound, and the body only is subject to death. 
Article II. Of the Law
1] Here we hold that the Law was given by God, first, to restrain sin by threats and 
the dread of punishment, and by the promise and offer of grace and benefit. But all 
this miscarried on account of the wickedness which sin has wrought in man. 2] For 
thereby a part [some] were rendered worse, those, namely, who are hostile to [hate] 
The Lutheran Confessions
274
the Law, because it forbids what they like to do, and enjoins what they do not like 
to do. Therefore, wherever they can escape [if they were not restrained by] punish-
ment, they [would] do more against the Law than before. These, then, are the rude 
and wicked [unbridled and secure] men, who do evil wherever they [notice that 
they] have the opportunity.
3] The rest become blind and arrogant [are smitten with arrogance and blindness], 
and [insolently] conceive the opinion that they observe and can observe the Law 
by their own powers, as has been said above concerning the scholastic theologians; 
thence come the hypocrites and [self-righteous or] false saints.
4] But the chief office or force of the Law is that it reveal original sin with all its 
fruits, and show man how very low his nature has fallen, and has become [fun-
damentally and] utterly corrupted; as the Law must tell man that he has no God 
nor regards [cares for] God, and worships other gods, a matter which before and 
without the Law he would not have believed. In this way he becomes terrified, is 
humbled, desponds, despairs, and anxiously desires aid, but sees no escape; he be-
gins to be an enemy of [enraged at] God, and to murmur, etc. 5] This is what Paul 
says, Rom. 4:15: The Law worketh wrath. And Rom. 5:20: Sin is increased by the Law. 
[The Law entered that the offense might abound.] 
Article III. Of Repentance.
1] This office [of the Law] the New Testament retains and urges, as St. Paul, Rom. 
1:18 does, saying: The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and 
unrighteousness of men. Again, Rom 3:19: All the world is guilty before God. No man is 
righteous before Him. And Christ says, John 16:8: The Holy Ghost will reprove the world 
of sin.
2] This, then, is the thunderbolt of God by which He strikes in a heap [hurls to the 
ground] both manifest sinners and false saints [hypocrites], and suffers no one to 
be in the right [declares no one righteous], but drives them all together to terror 
and despair. This is the hammer, as Jeremiah 23:29 says: Is not My Word like a hammer 
that breaketh the rock in pieces? This is not activa contritio or manufactured repen-
tance, but passiva contritio [torture of conscience], true sorrow of heart, suffering 
and sensation of death.
3] This, then, is what it means to begin true repentance; and here man must hear 
such a sentence as this: You are all of no account, whether you be manifest sinners 
or saints [in your own opinion]; you all must become different and do otherwise 
The Smalcald Articles
275
than you now are and are doing [no matter what sort of people you are], whether 
you are as great, wise, powerful, and holy as you may. Here no one is [righteous, 
holy], godly, etc.
4] But to this office the New Testament immediately adds the consolatory promise 
of grace through the Gospel, which must be believed, as Christ declares, Mark 1:15: 
Repent and believe the Gospel, i.e., become different and do otherwise, and believe 
My promise. And John, preceding Him, is called a preacher of repentance, howev-
er, for the remission of sins, i.e., John was to accuse all, and convict them of being 
sinners, that they might know what they were before God, and might acknowledge 
that they were lost men, and might thus be prepared for the Lord, to receive grace, 
and to expect and accept from Him the remission of sins. Thus also Christ Him-
self says, Luke 24:47: 6] Repentance and remission of sins must be preached in My name 
among all nations.
7] But whenever the Law alone, without the Gospel being added exercises this 
its office there is [nothing else than] death and hell, and man must despair, like 
Saul and Judas; as St. Paul, Rom. 7:10, says: Through sin the Law killeth. 8] On the 
other hand, the Gospel brings consolation and remission not only in one way, but 
through the word and Sacraments, and the like, as we shall hear afterward in order 
that [thus] there is with the Lord plenteous redemption, as Ps. 130:7 says against the 
dreadful captivity of sin.
9] However, we must now contrast the false repentance of the sophists with true 
repentance, in order that both may be the better understood. 
Of the False Repentance of the Papists.
10] It was impossible that they should teach correctly concerning repentance, 
since they did not [rightly] know the real sins [the real sin]. For, as has been shown 
above, they do not believe aright concerning original sin, but say that the natural 
powers of man have remained [entirely] unimpaired and incorrupt; that reason can 
teach aright, and the will can in accordance therewith do aright [perform those 
things which are taught]; that God certainly bestows His grace when a man does as 
much as is in him, according to his free will.
11] It had to follow thence [from this dogma] that they did [must do] penance only 
for actual sins, such as wicked thoughts to which a person yields (for wicked emo-
tion [concupiscence, vicious feelings, and inclinations], lust and improper dispo-
sitions [according to them] are not sins), and for wicked words and wicked deeds, 
which free will could readily have omitted.
The Lutheran Confessions
276
12] And of such repentance they fix three parts, contrition, confession, and 
satisfaction, with this [magnificent] consolation and promise added: If man truly 
repent, [feel remorse,] confess, render satisfaction, he thereby would have merited 
forgiveness, and paid for his sins before God [atoned for his sins and obtained a 
plenary redemption]. Thus in repentance they instructed men to repose confidence 
in their own works. 13] Hence the expression originated, which was employed in 
the pulpit when public absolution was announced to the people: Prolong O God, my 
life, until I shall make satisfaction for my sins and amend my life.
14] There was here [profound silence and] no mention of Christ nor faith; but men 
hoped by their own works to overcome and blot out sins before God. And with 
this intention we became priests and monks, that we might array ourselves against 
sin.
15] As to contrition, this is the way it was done: Since no one could remember all 
his sins (especially as committed through an entire year), they inserted this provi-
sion, namely, that if an unknown sin should be remembered later [if the remem-
brance of a concealed sin should perhaps return], this also must be repented of and 
confessed, etc. Meanwhile they were [the person was] commended to the grace of 
God.
16] Moreover, since no one could know how great the contrition ought to be in or-
der to be sufficient before God, they gave this consolation: He who could not have 
contrition, at least ought to have attrition, which I may call half a contrition or 
the beginning of contrition; for they have themselves understood neither of these 
terms nor do they understand them now, as little as I. Such attrition was reckoned 
as contrition when a person went to confession.
17] And when it happened that any one said that he could not have contrition 
nor lament his sins (as might have occurred in illicit love or the desire for revenge, 
etc.), they asked whether he did not wish or desire to have contrition [lament]. 
When one would reply Yes (for who, save the devil himself, would here say No?), 
they accepted this as contrition, and forgave him his sins on account of this good 
work of his [which they adorned with the name of contrition]. Here they cited the 
example of St. Bernard, etc.
18] Here we see how blind reason, in matters pertaining to God, gropes about, 
and, according to its own imagination, seeks for consolation in its own works, and 
cannot think of [entirely forgets] Christ and faith. But if it be [clearly] viewed in 
the light, this contrition is a manufactured and fictitious thought [or imagination], 
derived from man’s own powers, without faith and without the knowledge of 
Christ. And in it the poor sinner, when he reflected upon his own lust and desire 
The Smalcald Articles
277
for revenge, would sometimes [perhaps] have laughed rather than wept [either 
laughed or wept, rather than to think of something else], except such as either 
had been truly struck by [the lightning of] the Law, or had been vainly vexed by 
the devil with a sorrowful spirit. Otherwise [with the exception of these persons] 
such contrition was certainly mere hypocrisy, and did not mortify the lust for sins 
[flames of sin]; for they had to grieve, while they would rather have continued to 
sin, if it had been free to them.
19] As regards confession, the procedure was this: Every one had [was enjoined] 
to enumerate all his sins (which is an impossible thing). This was a great torment. 
From such as he had forgotten [But if any one had forgotten some sins] he would 
be absolved on the condition that, if they would occur to him, he must still confess 
them. In this way he could never know whether he had made a sufficiently pure 
confession [perfectly and correctly], or when confessing would ever have an end. 
Yet he was pointed to his own works, and comforted thus: The more fully [sincerely 
and frankly] one confesses, and the more he humiliates himself and debases himself 
before the priest, the sooner and better he renders satisfaction for his sins; for such 
humility certainly would earn grace before God.
20] Here, too, there was no faith nor Christ, and the virtue of the absolution was 
not declared to him, but upon his enumeration of sins and his self-abasement 
depended his consolation. What torture, rascality, and idolatry such confession has 
produced is more than can be related.
21] As to satisfaction, this is by far the most involved [perplexing] part of all. For 
no man could know how much to render for a single sin, not to say how much for 
all. Here they have resorted to the device of imposing a small satisfaction, which 
could indeed be rendered, as five Paternosters, a day’s fast, etc.; for the rest [that 
was lacking] of the [in their] repentance they were directed to purgatory.
22] Here, too, there was nothing but anguish and [extreme] misery. [For] some 
thought that they would never get out of purgatory, because, according to the old 
canons, seven years’ repentance is required for a single mortal sin. 23] Nevertheless, 
confidence was placed upon our work of satisfaction, and if the satisfaction could 
have been perfect, confidence would have been placed in it entirely, and neither 
faith nor Christ would have been of use. But this confidence was impossible. For, 
although any one had done penance in that way for a hundred years, he would still 
not have known whether he had finished his penance. That meant forever to do 
penance and never to come to repentance.
The Lutheran Confessions
278
24] Here now the Holy See at Rome, coming to the aid of the poor Church, invented 
indulgences, whereby it forgave and remitted [expiation or] satisfaction, first, for a 
single instance, for seven years, for a hundred years and distributed them among the 
cardinals and bishops, so that one could grant indulgence for a hundred years and 
another for a hundred days. But he reserved to himself alone the power to remit the 
entire satisfaction.
25] Now, since this began to yield money, and the traffic in bulls became profit-
able he devised the golden jubilee year [a truly gold-bearing year], and fixed it at 
Rome. He called this the remission of all punishment and guilt. Then the people 
came running, because every one would fain have been freed from this grievous, 
unbearable burden. This meant to find [dig up] and raise the treasures of the earth. 
Immediately the Pope pressed still further, and multiplied the golden years one 
upon another. But the more he devoured money, the wider grew his maw.
Later, therefore, he issued them [those golden years of his] by his legates [every-
where] to the countries, until all churches and houses were full of the Golden Year. 
26] At last he also made an inroad into purgatory among the dead, first, by found-
ing masses and vigils, afterwards, by indulgences and the Golden Year, and finally 
souls became so cheap that he released one for a farthing.
27] But all this, too, was of no avail. For although the Pope taught men to depend 
upon, and trust in, these indulgences [for salvation], yet he rendered the [whole] 
matter again uncertain. For in his bulls he declares: Whoever would share in the 
indulgences or a Golden Year must be contrite, and have confessed, and pay money. 
Now, we have heard above that this contrition and confession are with them uncer-
tain and hypocrisy. Likewise, also no one knew what soul was in purgatory, and if 
some were therein, no one knew which had properly repented and confessed. Thus 
he took the precious money [the Pope snatched up the holy pence], and comforted 
them meanwhile with [led them to confidence in] his power and indulgence, and 
[then again led them away from that and] directed them again to their uncertain 
work.
28] If, now [although], there were some who did not believe [acknowledge] them-
selves guilty of such actual sins in [committed by] thoughts, words, and works,—as 
I, and such as I, in monasteries and chapters [fraternities or colleges of priests], 
wished to be monks and priests, and by fasting, watching, praying, saying Mass, 
coarse garments, and hard beds, etc., fought against [strove to resist] evil thoughts, 
and in full earnest and with force wanted to be holy, and yet the hereditary, inborn 
evil sometimes did in sleep what it is wont to do (as also St. Augustine and Jerome 
among others confess),—still each one held the other in esteem, so that some, ac-
The Smalcald Articles
279
cording to our teaching, were regarded as holy, without sin and full of good works, 
so much so that with this mind we would communicate and sell our good works to 
others, as being superfluous to us for heaven. This is indeed true, and seals, letters, 
and instances [that this happened] are at hand.
29] [When there were such, I say,] These did not need repentance. For of what 
would they repent, since they had not indulged wicked thoughts? What would they 
confess [concerning words not uttered], since they had avoided words? For what 
should they render satisfaction, since they were so guiltless of any deed that they 
could even sell their superfluous righteousness to other poor sinners? Such saints 
were also the Pharisees and scribes in the time of Christ.
30] Here comes the fiery angel, St. John [Rev. 10], the true preacher of [true] re-
pentance, and with one [thunderclap and] bolt hurls both [those selling and those 
buying works] on one heap, and says: Repent! Matt. 3:2. 31] Now, the former [the 
poor wretches] imagine: Why, we have repented! The latter [the rest] say: We need 
no repentance. 32] John says: Repent ye, both of you, for ye are false penitents; so 
are these [the rest] false saints [or hypocrites], and all of you on either side need 
the forgiveness of sins, because neither of you know what true sin is not to say 
anything about your duty to repent of it and shun it. For no one of you is good; 
you are full of unbelief, stupidity, and ignorance of God and God’s will. For here 
He is present of whose fulness have all we received, and grace for grace, John 1:16, and 
without Him no man can be just before God. Therefore, if you wish to repent, 
repent aright; your penance will not accomplish anything [is nothing]. And you 
hypocrites, who do not need repentance, you serpents’ brood, who has assured you 
that you will escape the wrath to come? etc. Matt. 3:7; Luke 3:7.
33] In the same way Paul also preaches, Rom. 3:10-12: There is none righteous, there 
is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God, there is none that doeth 
good, no not one; they are all gone out of the way; they are together become unprofitable. 
34] And Acts 17:30: God now commandeth all men everywhere to repent. “All men,” he 
says; no one excepted who is a man. 35] This repentance teaches us to discern sin, 
namely, that we are altogether lost, and that there is nothing good in us from head 
to foot [both within and without], and that we must absolutely become new and 
other men.
36] This repentance is not piecemeal [partial] and beggarly [fragmentary], like 
that which does penance for actual sins, nor is it uncertain like that. For it does 
not debate what is or is not sin, but hurls everything on a heap, and says: All in us 
is nothing but sin [affirms that, with respect to us, all is simply sin (and there is 
nothing in us that is not sin and guilt)]. What is the use of [For why do we wish] 
The Lutheran Confessions
280
investigating, dividing, or distinguishing a long time? For this reason, too, this 
contrition is not [doubtful or] uncertain. For there is nothing left with which we 
can think of any good thing to pay for sin, but there is only a sure despairing con-
cerning all that we are, think, speak, or do [all hope must be cast aside in respect of 
everything], etc.
37] In like manner confession, too, cannot be false, uncertain, or piecemeal [mu-
tilated or fragmentary]. For he who confesses that all in him is nothing but sin 
comprehends all sins, excludes none, forgets none. 38] Neither can the satisfaction 
be uncertain, because it is not our uncertain, sinful work, but it is the suffering and 
blood of the [spotless and] innocent Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the 
world.
39] Of this repentance John preaches, and afterwards Christ in the Gospel, and 
we also. By this [preaching of] repentance we dash to the ground the Pope and ev-
erything that is built upon our good works. For all is built upon a rotten and vain 
foundation, which is called a good work or law, even though no good work is there, 
but only wicked works, and no one does the Law (as Christ, John 7:19, says), but all 
transgress it. Therefore the building [that is raised upon it] is nothing but falsehood 
and hypocrisy, even [in the part] where it is most holy and beautiful.
40] And in Christians this repentance continues until death, because, through the 
entire life it contends with sin remaining in the flesh, as Paul, Rom. 7:14-25, [shows] 
testifies that he wars with the law in his members, etc.; and that, not by his own pow-
ers, but by the gift of the Holy Ghost that follows the remission of sins. This gift 
daily cleanses and sweeps out the remaining sins, and works so as to render man 
truly pure and holy.
41] The Pope, the theologians, the jurists, and every other man know nothing of 
this [from their own reason], but it is a doctrine from heaven, revealed through the 
Gospel, and must suffer to be called heresy by the godless saints [or hypocrites].
42] On the other hand, if certain sectarists would arise, some of whom are perhaps 
already extant, and in the time of the insurrection [of the peasants] came to my 
own view, holding that all those who had once received the Spirit or the forgive-
ness of sins, or had become believers, even though they should afterwards sin, 
would still remain in the faith, and such sin would not harm them, and [hence] 
crying thus: “Do whatever you please; if you believe, it all amounts to nothing; faith 
blots out all sins,” etc.—they say, besides, that if any one sins after he has received 
faith and the Spirit, he never truly had the Spirit and faith: I have had before me 
The Smalcald Articles
281
[seen and heard] many such insane men, and I fear that in some such a devil is still 
remaining [hiding and dwelling].
43] It is, accordingly, necessary to know and to teach that when holy men, still 
having and feeling original sin, also daily repenting of and striving with it, happen 
to fall into manifest sins, as David into adultery, murder, and blasphemy, that then 
faith and the Holy Ghost has departed from them [they cast out faith and the Holy 
Ghost]. For the Holy Ghost does not permit sin to have dominion, to gain the 
upper hand so as to be accomplished, but represses and restrains it so that it must 
not do what it wishes. But if it does what it wishes, the Holy Ghost and faith are 
[certainly] not present. For St. John says, 1 John 3:9: Whosoever is born of God doth not 
commit sin, ... and he cannot sin. And yet it is also the truth when the same St. John says, 
1:8: If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 
Article IV. Of the Gospel.
We will now return to the Gospel, which not merely in one way gives us counsel 
and aid against sin; for God is superabundantly rich [and liberal] in His grace 
[and goodness]. First, through the spoken Word by which the forgiveness of sins is 
preached [He commands to be preached] in the whole world; which is the peculiar 
office of the Gospel. Secondly, through Baptism. Thirdly, through the holy Sacra-
ment of the Altar. Fourthly, through the power of the keys, and also through the 
mutual conversation and consolation of brethren, Matt. 18:20: Where two or three are 
gathered together, etc. 
Article V. Of Baptism.
1] Baptism is nothing else than the Word of God in the water, commanded by His 
institution, or, as Paul says, a washing in the Word; as also Augustine says: Let the 
Word come to the element, and it becomes a Sacrament. 2] And for this reason we do 
not hold with Thomas and the monastic preachers [or Dominicans] who forget the 
Word (God’s institution) and say that God has imparted to the water a spiritual 
power, which through the water washes away sin. 3] Nor [do we agree] with Scotus 
and the Barefooted monks [Minorites or Franciscan monks], who teach that, by 
the assistance of the divine will, Baptism washes away sins, and that this ablution 
occurs only through the will of God, and by no means through the Word or water.
The Lutheran Confessions
282
4] Of the baptism of children we hold that children ought to be baptized. For they 
belong to the promised redemption made through Christ, and the Church should 
administer it [Baptism and the announcement of that promise] to them. 
Article VI. Of the Sacrament of the Altar.
1] Of the Sacrament of the Altar we hold that bread and wine in the Supper are 
the true body and blood of Christ, and are given and received not only by the god-
ly, but also by wicked Christians.
2] And that not only one form is to be given. [For] we do not need that high art 
[specious wisdom] which is to teach us that under the one form there is as much 
as under both, as the sophists and the Council of Constance teach. 3] For even if 
it were true that there is as much under one as under both, yet the one form only 
is not the entire ordinance and institution [made] ordained and commanded by 
Christ. 4] And we especially condemn and in God’s name execrate those who not 
only omit both forms but also quite autocratically [tyrannically] prohibit, con-
demn, and blaspheme them as heresy, and so exalt themselves against and above 
Christ, our Lord and God [opposing and placing themselves ahead of Christ], etc.
5] As regards transubstantiation, we care nothing about the sophistical subtlety 
by which they teach that bread and wine leave or lose their own natural substance, 
and that there remain only the appearance and color of bread, and not true bread. 
For it is in perfect agreement with Holy Scriptures that there is, and remains, 
bread, as Paul himself calls it, 1 Cor. 10:16: The bread which we break. And 1 Cor. 
11:28: Let him so eat of that bread. 
Article VII. Of the Keys.
1] The keys are an office and power given by Christ to the Church for binding and 
loosing sin, not only the gross and well-known sins, but also the subtle, hidden, 
which are known only to God, as it is written in Ps. 19:13: Who can understand his er-
rors? And in Rom. 7:25 St. Paul himself complains that with the flesh he serves the law 
of sin. 2] For it is not in our power, but belongs to God alone, to judge which, how 
great, and how many the sins are, as it is written in Ps. 143:2: Enter not into judgment 
with Thy servant; for in Thy sight shall no man living be justified. 3] And Paul says, 1 
Cor. 4:4: For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified. 
The Smalcald Articles
283
Article VIII. Of Confession.
1] Since Absolution or the Power of the Keys is also an aid and consolation against 
sin and a bad conscience, ordained by Christ [Himself] in the Gospel, Confession 
or Absolution ought by no means to be abolished in the Church, especially on 
account of [tender and] timid consciences and on account of the untrained [and 
capricious] young people, in order that they may be examined, and instructed in 
the Christian doctrine.
2] But the enumeration of sins ought to be free to every one, as to what he wishes 
to enumerate or not to enumerate. For as long as we are in the flesh, we shall not 
lie when we say: “I am a poor man [I acknowledge that I am a miserable sinner], full 
of sin.” Rom. 7:23: I see another law in my members, etc. For since private absolution 
originates in the Office of the Keys, it should not be despised [neglected], but 
greatly and highly esteemed [of the greatest worth], as [also] all other offices of the 
Christian Church.
3] And in those things which concern the spoken, outward Word, we must firmly 
hold that God grants His Spirit or grace to no one, except through or with the pre-
ceding outward Word, in order that we may [thus] be protected against the enthu-
siasts, i.e., spirits who boast that they have the Spirit without and before the Word, 
and accordingly judge Scripture or the spoken Word, and explain and stretch it 
at their pleasure, as Muenzer did, and many still do at the present day, who wish 
to be acute judges between the Spirit and the letter, and yet know not what they 
say or declare. 4] For [indeed] the Papacy also is nothing but sheer enthusiasm, by 
which the Pope boasts that all rights exist in the shrine of his heart, and whatever 
he decides and commands with [in] his church is spirit and right, even though it is 
above and contrary to Scripture and the spoken Word.
5] All this is the old devil and old serpent, who also converted Adam and Eve into 
enthusiasts, and led them from the outward Word of God to spiritualizing and 
self-conceit, and nevertheless he accomplished this through other outward words. 
6] Just as also our enthusiasts [at the present day] condemn the outward Word, 
and nevertheless they themselves are not silent, but they fill the world with their 
pratings and writings, as though, indeed, the Spirit could not come through the 
writings and spoken word of the apostles, but [first] through their writings and 
words he must come. Why [then] do not they also omit their own sermons and 
writings, until the Spirit Himself come to men, without their writings and before 
them, as they boast that He has come into them without the preaching of the 
Scriptures? But of these matters there is not time now to dispute at greater length; 
we have elsewhere sufficiently urged this subject.
The Lutheran Confessions
284
7] For even those who believe before Baptism, or become believing in Baptism, 
believe through the preceding outward Word, as the adults, who have come to 
reason, must first have heard: He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, even 
though they are at first unbelieving, and receive the Spirit and Baptism ten years 
afterwards. 8] Cornelius, Acts 10:1ff, had heard long before among the Jews of the 
coming Messiah, through whom he was righteous before God, and in such faith his 
prayers and alms were acceptable to God (as Luke calls him devout and God-fear-
ing), and without such preceding Word and hearing could not have believed or 
been righteous. But St. Peter had to reveal to him that the Messiah (in whom, as 
one that was to come, he had hitherto believed) now had come, lest his faith con-
cerning the coming Messiah hold him captive among the hardened and unbelieving 
Jews, but know that he was now to be saved by the present Messiah, and must not, 
with the [rabble of the] Jews deny nor persecute Him.
9] In a word, enthusiasm inheres in Adam and his children from the beginning 
[from the first fall] to the end of the world, [its poison] having been implanted and 
infused into them by the old dragon, and is the origin, power [life], and strength of 
all heresy, especially of that of the Papacy and Mahomet. 10] Therefore we ought 
and must constantly maintain this point, that God does not wish to deal with us 
otherwise than through the spoken Word and the Sacraments. 11] It is the devil 
himself whatsoever is extolled as Spirit without the Word and Sacraments. For 
God wished to appear even to Moses through the burning bush and spoken Word; 
and no prophet neither Elijah nor Elisha, received the Spirit without the Ten Com-
mandments [or spoken Word]. 12] Neither was John the Baptist conceived without 
the preceding word of Gabriel, nor did he leap in his mother’s womb without the 
voice of Mary. 13] And Peter says, 2 Pet. 1:21: The prophecy came not by the will of 
man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Without the 
outward Word, however, they were not holy, much less would the Holy Ghost have 
moved them to speak when they still were unholy [or profane]; for they were holy, 
says he, since the Holy Ghost spake through them. 
Article IX. Of Excommunication.
The greater excommunication, as the Pope calls it, we regard only as a civil penalty, 
and it does not concern us ministers of the Church. But the lesser, that is, the true 
Christian excommunication, consists in this, that manifest and obstinate sinners 
are not admitted to the Sacrament and other communion of the Church until they 
amend their lives and avoid sin. And ministers ought not to mingle secular punish-
ments with this ecclesiastical punishment, or excommunication.

Article X. Of Ordination and the Call.
1] If the bishops would be true bishops [would rightly discharge their office], and 
would devote themselves to the Church and the Gospel, it might be granted to 
them for the sake of love and unity, but not from necessity, to ordain and confirm 
us and our preachers; omitting, however, all comedies and spectacular display 
[deceptions, absurdities, and appearances] of unchristian [heathenish] parade and 
pomp. 2] But because they neither are, nor wish to be, true bishops, but worldly 
lords and princes, who will neither preach, nor teach, nor baptize, nor administer 
the Lord’s Supper, nor perform any work or office of the Church, and, moreover, 
persecute and condemn those who discharge these functions, having been called to 
do so, the Church ought not on their account to remain without ministers [to be 
forsaken by or deprived of ministers].
3] Therefore, as the ancient examples of the Church and the Fathers teach us, we 
ourselves will and ought to ordain suitable persons to this office; and, even accord-
ing to their own laws, they have not the right to forbid or prevent us. For their 
laws say that those ordained even by heretics should be declared [truly] ordained 
and stay ordained [and that such ordination must not be changed], as St. Jerome 
writes of the Church at Alexandria, that at first it was governed in common by 
priests and preachers, without bishops. 
Article XI. Of the Marriage of Priests.
1] To prohibit marriage, and to burden the divine order of priests with perpetual 
celibacy, they have had neither authority nor right [they have done out of malice, 
without any honest reason], but have acted like antichristian, tyrannical, desper-
ate scoundrels [have performed the work of antichrist, of tyrants and the worst 
knaves], and have thereby caused all kinds of horrible, abominable, innumerable 
sins of unchastity [depraved lusts], in which they still wallow. 2] Now, as little as we 
or they have been given the power to make a woman out of a man or a man out of 
a woman, or to nullify either sex, so little have they had the power to [sunder and] 
separate such creatures of God, or to forbid them from living [and cohabiting] hon-
estly in marriage with one another. 3] Therefore we are unwilling to assent to their 
abominable celibacy, nor will we [even] tolerate it, but we wish to have marriage 
free as God has instituted [and ordained] it, and we wish neither to rescind nor 
hinder His work; for Paul says, 1 Tim. 4:1ff, that this [prohibition of marriage] is a 
doctrine of devils. 
The Lutheran Confessions

Article XII. Of the Church.
1] We do not concede to them that they are the Church, and [in truth] they are 
not [the Church]; nor will we listen to those things which, under the name of 
Church, they enjoin or forbid. 2] For, thank God, [to-day] a child seven years old 
knows what the Church is, namely, the holy believers and lambs who hear the 
voice of their Shepherd. For the children pray thus: I believe in one holy [catholic or] 
Christian Church. 3] This holiness does not consist in albs, tonsures, long gowns, and 
other of their ceremonies devised by them beyond Holy Scripture, but in the Word 
of God and true faith. 
Article XIII. How One is Justified before God, and of Good Works.
1] What I have hitherto and constantly taught concerning this I know not how to 
change in the least, namely, that by faith, as St. Peter says, we acquire a new and 
clean heart, and God will and does account us entirely righteous and holy for the 
sake of Christ, our Mediator. And although sin in the flesh has not yet been alto-
gether removed or become dead, yet He will not punish or remember it.
2] And such faith, renewal, and forgiveness of sins is followed by good works. And 
what there is still sinful or imperfect also in them shall not be accounted as sin 
or defect, even [and that, too] for Christ’s sake; but the entire man, both as to his 
person and his works, is to be called and to be righteous and holy from pure grace 
and mercy, shed upon us [unfolded] and spread over us in Christ. 3] Therefore we 
cannot boast of many merits and works, if they are viewed apart from grace and 
mercy, but as it is written, 1 Cor. 1:31: He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord, name-
ly, that he has a gracious God. For thus all is well. 4] We say, besides, that if good 
works do not follow, faith is false and not true. 
Article XIV. Of Monastic Vows.
1] As monastic vows directly conflict with the first chief article, they must be 
absolutely abolished. For it is of them that Christ says, Matt. 24:5,23ff: I am Christ, 
etc. 2] For he who makes a vow to live as a monk believes that he will enter upon a 
mode of life holier than ordinary Christians lead, and wishes to earn heaven by his 
own works not only for himself, but also for others; this is to deny Christ. 3] And 
they boast from their St. Thomas that a monastic vow is equal to Baptism. This is 
blasphemy [against God]. 
The Smalcald Articles
287
Article XV. Of Human Traditions.
1] The declaration of the Papists that human traditions serve for the remission of 
sins, or merit salvation, is [altogether] unchristian and condemned, as Christ says 
Matt. 15:9: In vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. 
2] Again, Titus 1:14: That turn from the truth. Again, when they declare that it is a 
mortal sin if one breaks these ordinances [does not keep these statutes], this, too, is 
not right.
3] These are the articles on which I must stand, and, God willing, shall stand even 
to my death; and I do not know how to change or to yield anything in them. If any 
one wishes to yield anything, let him do it at the peril of his conscience.
4] Lastly, there still remains the Pope’s bag of impostures concerning foolish and 
childish articles, as, the dedication of churches, the baptism of bells, the baptism 
of the altarstone, and the inviting of sponsors to these rites, who would make do-
nations towards them. Such baptizing is a reproach and mockery of Holy Baptism, 
hence should not be tolerated. 5] Furthermore, concerning the consecration of 
wax-tapers, palm-branches, cakes, oats, [herbs,] spices, etc., which indeed, cannot 
be called consecrations, but are sheer mockery and fraud. And such deceptions 
there are without number, which we commend for adoration to their god and to 
themselves, until they weary of it. We will [ought to] have nothing to do with them.

A Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the 
Pope
Treatise Compiled by the Theologians Assembled at Smalcald – 1537
1] The Roman Pontiff claims for himself [in the first place] that by divine right he 
is [supreme] above all bishops and pastors [in all Christendom].
2] Secondly, he adds also that by divine right he has both swords, i.e., the authority 
also of bestowing kingdoms [enthroning and deposing kings, regulating secular 
dominions etc.].
3] And thirdly, he says that to believe this is necessary for salvation. And for these 
reasons the Roman bishop calls himself [and boasts that he is] the vicar of Christ 
on earth.
4] These three articles we hold to be false, godless, tyrannical, and [quite] perni-
cious to the Church.
5] Now, in order that our proof [reason and opinion] may be [better] understood, 
we shall first define what they call being above all [what it means that he boasts of 
being supreme] by divine right. For they mean that he is universal [that the Pope 
is the general bishop over the entire Christian Church], or, as they say, ecumen-
ical bishop, i.e., from whom all bishops and pastors throughout the entire world 
ought to seek ordination and [confirmation, who [alone] is to have the right of 
electing, ordaining, confirming, deposing all bishops [and pastors]. 6] Besides this, 
he arrogates to himself the authority to make [all kinds of] laws concerning acts 
of worship, concerning changing the Sacraments [and] concerning doctrine, and 
wishes his articles, his decrees, his laws [his statutes and ordinances] to be con-
sidered equal to the divine laws [to other articles of the Christian Creed and the 
Holy Scriptures], i.e., he holds that by the papal laws the consciences of men are so 
bound that those who neglect them, even without public offense, sin mortally [that 
they cannot be omitted without sin. For he wishes to found this power upon divine 
right and the Holy Scriptures; yea, he wishes to have it preferred to the Holy Scrip-
tures and God's commands]. And what he adds is still more horrible, namely, that 
it is necessary to believe all these things in order to be saved [all these things shall 
and must be believed at the peril of forfeiting salvation].
A Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope
291
7] In the first place, therefore, let us show from the [holy] Gospel that the Roman 
bishop is not by divine right above [cannot arrogate to himself any supremacy 
whatever over] other bishops and pastors.
8] I. Luke 22:25. Christ expressly prohibits lordship among the apostles [that no 
apostle should have any supremacy over the rest]. For this was the very question, 
namely, that when Christ spake of His passion, they were disputing who should 
be at the head, and as it were the vicar of the absent Christ. There Christ reproves 
this error of the apostles and teaches that there shall not be lordship or superiority 
among them, but that the apostles should be sent forth as equals to the common 
ministry of the Gospel. Accordingly, He says: The kings of the Gentiles exercise lord-
ship over them, and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors, but ye 
shall not be so; but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that 
is chief, as he that doth serve. The antithesis here shows [By holding these matters 
against one another, one sees] that lordship [among the apostles] is disapproved.
II. Matt. 18:2. The same is taught by the parable when Christ in the same dispute 
concerning the kingdom places a little child in the midst, signifying that among 
ministers there is not to be sovereignty, just as a child neither takes nor seeks sov-
ereignty for himself.
9] III. John 20:21. Christ sends forth His disciples on an equality, without any 
distinction [so that no one of them was to have more or less power than any other], 
when He says: As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you. [These words are clear 
and plain:] He says that He sends them individually in the same manner as He 
Himself was sent; hence He grants to no one a prerogative or lordship above the 
rest.
10] IV. Gal. 2:7f St. Paul manifestly affirms that he was neither ordained nor 
confirmed [and endorsed] by Peter, nor does he acknowledge Peter to be one from 
whom confirmation should be sought. And he expressly contends concerning this 
point that his call does not depend upon the authority of Peter. But he ought to 
have acknowledged Peter as a superior if Peter was superior by divine right [if 
Peter, indeed, had received such supremacy from Christ]. Paul accordingly says 
that he had at once preached the Gospel [freely for a long time] without consult-
ing Peter. Also: Of those who seemed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were, it maketh 
no matter to me; God accepteth no man’s person). And: They who seemed to be somewhat 
in conference added nothing to me. Since Paul, then, clearly testifies that he did not 
even wish to seek for the confirmation of Peter [for permission to preach] even 
when he had come to him, he teaches that the authority of the ministry depends 
upon the Word of God, and that Peter was not superior to the other apostles, and 
The Lutheran Confessions
292
that it was not from this one individual Peter that ordination or confirmation was 
to be sought [that the office of the ministry proceeds from the general call of the 
apostles, and that it is not necessary for all to have the call or confirmation of this 
one person, Peter, alone].
11] V. In 1 Cor. 3:6, Paul makes ministers equal, and teaches that the Church is 
above the ministers. Hence superiority or lordship over the Church or the rest of 
the ministers is not ascribed to Peter [in preference to other apostles]. For he says 
thus: All things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, i.e., let neither the other 
ministers nor Peter assume for themselves lordship or superiority over the Church; 
let them not burden the Church with traditions; let not the authority of any avail 
more than the Word [of God]; let not the authority of Cephas be opposed to the 
authority of the other apostles, as they reasoned at that time: “Cephas, who is an 
apostle of higher rank, observes this; therefore, both Paul and the rest ought to 
observe this.” Paul removes this pretext from Peter, and denies [Not so, says Paul, 
and makes Peter doff his little hat, namely, the claim] that his authority is to be 
preferred to the rest or to the Church.
12] VI. The Council of Nice resolved that the bishop of Alexandria should adminis-
ter the churches in the East, and the Roman bishop the suburban, i.e., those which 
were in the Roman provinces in the West. From this start by a human law, i.e. the 
resolution of the Council, the authority of the Roman bishop first arose. If the 
Roman bishop already had the superiority by divine law, it would not have been 
lawful for the Council to take any right from him and transfer it to the bishop of 
Alexandria; nay, all the bishops of the East ought perpetually to have sought ordi-
nation and confirmation from the bishop of Rome.
13] VII. Again the Council of Nice determined that bishops should be elected 
by their own churches, in the presence of some neighboring bishop or of several. 
14] The same was observed [for a long time, not only in the East, but] also in the 
West and in the Latin churches, as Cyprian and Augustine testify. For Cyprian 
says in his fourth letter to Cornelius: Accordingly, as regards the divine observance and 
apostolic practice, you must diligently keep and practice what is also observed among us 
and in almost all the provinces, that for celebrating ordination properly, whatsoever bishops 
of the same province live nearest should come together with the people for whom a pastor 
is being appointed, and the bishop should be chosen in the presence of the people, who most 
fully know the life of each one, which we also have seen done among us at the ordination of 
our colleague Sabinus, that by the suffrage of the entire brotherhood, and by the judgment 
of the bishops who had assembled in their presence, the episcopate was conferred and hands 
laid on him.
A Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope
293
15] Cyprian calls this custom a divine tradition and an apostolic observance, and 
affirms that it is observed in almost all the provinces.
Since, therefore, neither ordination nor confirmation was sought from a bishop of 
Rome in the greater part of the world in the Latin and Greek churches, it is suffi-
ciently apparent that the churches did not then accord superiority and domination 
to the bishop of Rome.
16] Such superiority is impossible. For it is impossible for one bishop to be the 
overseer of the churches of the whole world, or for churches situated in the most 
distant lands to seek ordination [for all their ministers] from one. For it is manifest 
that the kingdom of Christ is scattered throughout the whole world; and to-day 
there are many churches in the East which do not seek ordination or confirmation 
from the Roman bishop [which have ministers ordained neither by the Pope nor 
his bishops]. Therefore, since such superiority [which the Pope, contrary to all 
Scripture, arrogates to himself] is impossible, and the churches in the greater part 
of the world have not acknowledged [nor made use of] it, it is sufficiently apparent 
that it was not instituted [by Christ, and does not spring from divine law].
17] VIII. Many ancient synods have been proclaimed and held in which the bishop 
of Rome did not preside; as that of Nice and most others. This, too, testifies that 
the Church did not then acknowledge the primacy or superiority of the bishop of 
Rome.
18] IX. Jerome says: If the question is concerning authority, the world is greater than the 
city. Wherever there has been a bishop, whether at Rome, or Eugubium, or Constantinople, 
or Rhegium, or Alexandria, he is of the same dignity and priesthood.
19] X. Gregory, writing to the patriarch at Alexandria, forbids that he be called 
universal bishop. And in the Records he says that in the Council of Chalcedon the 
primacy was offered to the bishop of Rome, but was not accepted.
20] XI. Lastly, how can the Pope be over the entire Church by divine right when 
the Church has the election, and the custom gradually prevailed that bishops of 
Rome were confirmed by the emperors? 21] Also, when for a long time there had 
been contests concerning the primacy between the bishops of Rome and Con-
stantinople, the Emperor Phocas finally determined that the primacy should be 
assigned to the bishop of Rome. But if the ancient Church had acknowledged the 
primacy of the Roman Pontiff, this contention could not have occurred, neither 
would there have been need of the decree of the emperor.
The Lutheran Confessions
294
22] But they cite against us certain passages, namely, Matt. 16:18f : Thou art Peter, 
and upon this rock I will build My Church; also: I will give unto thee the keys; also 
John 21:15: Feed My sheep, and some others. But since this entire controversy has 
been fully and accurately treated elsewhere in the books of our theologians, and 
everything cannot be reviewed in this place, we refer to those writings, and wish 
them to be regarded as repeated. Yet we shall reply briefly concerning the interpre-
tation [of the passages quoted].
23] In all these passages Peter is the representative of the entire assembly of apos-
tles [and does not speak for himself alone, but for all the apostles], as appears from 
the text itself. For Christ asks not Peter alone, but says: Whom do ye say that I am? 
And what is here said [to Peter alone] in the singular number: I will give unto thee 
the keys; and whatsoever thou shalt bind, etc., is elsewhere expressed [to their entire 
number], in the plural Matt. 18:18: Whatsoever ye shall bind, etc. And in John 20:23: 
Whosesoever sins ye remit, etc. These words testify that the keys are given alike to all 
the apostles and that all the apostles are alike sent forth [to preach].
24] In addition to this, it is necessary to acknowledge that the keys belong not to 
the person of one particular man, but to the Church, as many most clear and firm 
arguments testify. For Christ, speaking concerning the keys adds, Matt. 18:19: If two 
or three of you shall agree on earth, etc. Therefore he grants the keys principally and 
immediately to the Church, just as also for this reason the Church has principally 
the right of calling. [For just as the promise of the Gospel belongs certainly and 
immediately to the entire Church, so the keys belong immediately to the entire 
Church, because the keys are nothing else than the office whereby this promise 
is communicated to every one who desires it, just as it is actually manifest that 
the Church has the power to ordain ministers of the Church. And Christ speaks 
in these words: Whatsoever ye shall bind, etc., and indicates to whom He has given 
the keys, namely, to the Church: Where two or three are gathered together in My name. 
Likewise Christ gives supreme and final jurisdiction to the Church, when He says: 
Tell it unto the Church.]
Therefore it is necessary that in these passages Peter is the representative of the 
entire assembly of the apostles, and for this reason they do not accord to Peter any 
prerogative or superiority, or lordship [which he had, or was to have had, in prefer-
ence to the other apostles].
25] However, as to the declaration: Upon this rock I will build My Church, certainly 
the Church has not been built upon the authority of man, but upon the ministry 
of the confession which Peter made, in which he proclaims that Jesus is the Christ, 
the Son of God. He accordingly addresses him as a minister: Upon this rock, i.e., 
A Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope
295
upon this ministry. [Therefore he addresses him as a minister of this office in which 
this confession and doctrine is to be in operation and says: Upon this rock, i.e., this 
preaching and ministry.]
26] Furthermore, the ministry of the New Testament is not bound to places and 
persons as the Levitical ministry, but it is dispersed throughout the whole world, 
and is there where God gives His gifts, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers; neither 
does this ministry avail on account of the authority of any person, but on account 
of the Word given by Christ. 27] [Nor does the person of a teacher add anything 
to this word and office; it matters not who is preaching and teaching it; if there 
are hearts who receive and cling to it, to them it is done as they hear and believe.] 
And in this way, not as referring to the person of Peter, most of the holy Fathers, 
as Origen, Cyprian, Augustine, 28] Hilary, and Bede, interpret this passage: Upon 
this rock. Chrysostom says thus: “Upon this rock,” not upon Peter. For He built 
His Church not upon man, but upon the faith of Peter. But what was his faith? 
“Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” And Hilary says: To Peter the Father 
revealed that he should say, “Thou art the Son of the living God.” 29] Therefore the 
building of the Church is upon this rock of confession; this faith is the foundation 
of the Church.
30] And as to that which is said John 21:15ff: Feed My sheep, and, Lovest thou Me 
more than these? it does not as yet follow hence that a peculiar superiority was giv-
en Peter. He bids him "feed," i.e., teach the Word [the Gospel], or rule the Church 
with the Word [the Gospel], which Peter has in common with the other apostles.
31] The second article is still clearer, that Christ gave to the apostles only spiritual 
power, i.e., the command to teach the Gospel, to announce the forgiveness of sins, 
to administer the Sacraments, to excommunicate the godless without bodily force 
[by the Word], and that He did not give the power of the sword, or the right to 
establish, occupy or confer kingdoms of the world [to set up or depose kings]. For 
Christ says, Matt. 28:19. 20: Go ye, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever 
I have commanded you; also John 20:21: As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I 
you.
Now, it is manifest that Christ was not sent to bear the sword or possess a worldly 
kingdom [rule in a worldly fashion], as He Himself says, John 18:36: My kingdom is 
not of this world. And Paul says, 2 Cor. 1:24: Not for that we have dominion over 
your faith; and 2 Cor. 10:4: The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, etc.
32] Accordingly, that Christ in His passion is crowned with thorns and led forth 
to be derided in royal purple, this signified that in the future, after His spiritual 
The Lutheran Confessions
296
kingdom was despised, i.e., the Gospel was suppressed, another kingdom of a 
worldly kind would be set up [in its place] with the pretext of ecclesiastical power. 
33] Therefore the Constitution of Boniface VIII and the chapter Omnes, Dist. 22, 
and similar opinions which contend that the Pope is by divine right the ruler of 
the kingdoms of the world, are [utterly] false and godless. 34] From this persuasion 
horrible darkness has been brought into the Church, and after that also great com-
motions have arisen in Europe. For the ministry of the Gospel was neglected, the 
knowledge of faith and the spiritual kingdom became extinct, Christian righteous-
ness was supposed to be that external government which the Pope had established.
35] Next, the Popes began to seize upon kingdoms for themselves; they transferred 
kingdoms, they vexed with unjust excommunications and wars the kings of almost 
all nations in Europe, but especially the German emperors, sometimes for the 
purpose of occupying cities of Italy, at other times for the purpose of reducing to 
subjection the bishops of Germany, and wresting from the emperors the conferring 
of episcopates. Yea, in the Clementines it is even written: When the empire is vacant, 
the Pope is the legitimate successor.
36] Thus the Pope has not only usurped dominion, contrary to Christ's command, 
but has also tyrannically exalted himself above all kings. And in this matter the 
deed itself is not to be reprehended as much as it is to be detested, that he assigns 
as a pretext the authority of Christ; that he transfers the keys to a worldly govern-
ment; that he binds salvation to these godless and execrable opinions, when he says 
it is necessary to salvation for men to believe that this dominion belongs to him by 
divine right.
37] Since these great errors obscure [the doctrine of] faith and [of] the kingdom of 
Christ, they are in no way to be concealed. For the result shows that they have been 
great pests to the Church.
38] In the third place, this must be added: Even though the bishop of Rome had 
the primacy and superiority by divine right, nevertheless obedience would not be 
due those pontiffs who defend godless services, idolatry, and doctrine conflict-
ing with the Gospel. Nay; such pontiffs and such a government ought to be held 
accursed, as Paul clearly teaches, Gal. 1:8: Though an angel from heaven preach 
any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be 
accursed. And in Acts 5:29: We ought to obey God rather than men. Likewise the 
canons also clearly teach that a heretical Pope is not to be obeyed.
A Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope
297
The Levitical high priest was the chief priest by divine right, and yet godless high 
priests were not to be obeyed, as Jeremiah and other prophets dissented from the 
high priests, the apostles dissented from Caiaphas and did not have to obey them.
39] Now, it is manifest that the Roman pontiffs, with their adherents, defend [and 
practice] godless doctrines and godless services. And the marks [all the vices] of 
Antichrist plainly agree with the kingdom of the Pope and his adherents. For Paul, 
in describing Antichrist to the Thessalonians, calls him 2 Thess. 2:3-4: an adversary 
of Christ, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or that is 
worshiped, so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God. He speaks therefore of 
one ruling in the Church, not of heathen kings, and he calls this one the adversary 
of Christ, because he will devise doctrine conflicting with the Gospel, and will 
assume to himself divine authority.
40] Moreover, it is manifest, in the first place, that the Pope rules in the Church, 
and by the pretext of ecclesiastical authority and of the ministry has established 
for himself this kingdom. For he assigns as a pretext these words: I will give to thee 
the keys. Secondly, the doctrine of the Pope conflicts in many ways with the Gospel, 
and [thirdly] the Pope assumes to himself divine authority in a threefold manner. 
First, because he takes to himself the right to change the doctrine of Christ and 
services instituted by God, and wants his own doctrine and his own services to 
be observed as divine; secondly, because he takes to himself the power not only of 
binding and loosing in this life, but also the jurisdiction over souls after this life; 
thirdly, because the Pope does not want to be judged by the Church or by any 
one, and puts his own authority ahead of the decision of Councils and the entire 
Church. But to be unwilling to be judged by the Church or by any one is to make 
oneself God. Lastly, these errors so horrible, and this impiety, he defends with the 
greatest cruelty, and puts to death those dissenting.
41] This being the case, all Christians ought to beware of becoming partakers of 
the godless doctrine, blasphemies, and unjust cruelty of the Pope. On this account 
they ought to desert and execrate the Pope with his adherents as the kingdom of 
Antichrist; just as Christ has commanded, Matt. 7:15: Beware of false prophets. 
And Paul commands that godless teachers should be avoided and execrated as 
cursed, Gal. 1:8; Titus 3:10. And he says, 2 Cor. 6:14: Be ye not unequally yoked 
together with unbelievers; for what communion hath light with darkness?
42] To dissent from the agreement of so many nations and to be called schismatics 
is a grave matter. But divine authority commands all not to be allies and defenders 
of impiety and unjust cruelty.
The Lutheran Confessions

On this account our consciences are sufficiently excused; for the errors of the 
kingdom of the Pope are manifest. And Scripture with its entire voice exclaims 
that these errors are a teaching of demons and of Antichrist. 43] The idolatry in the 
profanation of the masses is manifest, which, besides other faults [besides being 
altogether useless] are shamelessly applied to most shameful gain [and trafficking]. 
44] The doctrine of repentance has been utterly corrupted by the Pope and his 
adherents. For they teach that sins are remitted because of the worth of our works. 
Then they bid us doubt whether the remission takes place. They nowhere teach that 
sins are remitted freely for Christ's sake, and that by this faith we obtain remission 
of sins.
Thus they obscure the glory of Christ, and deprive consciences of firm consolation, 
and abolish true divine services, namely, the exercises of faith struggling with [un-
belief and] despair [concerning the promise of the Gospel].
45] They have obscured the doctrine concerning sin, and have invented a tradition 
concerning the enumeration of offenses, producing many errors and despair.
They have devised, in addition, satisfactions, whereby they have also obscured the 
benefit [and merit] of Christ.
46] From these, indulgences have been born, which are pure lies, fabricated for the 
sake of gain.
47] Then, how many abuses and what horrible idolatry the invocation of saints has 
produced!
48] What shameful acts have arisen from the tradition concerning celibacy!
What darkness the doctrine concerning vows has spread over the Gospel! There 
they feigned that vows are righteousness before God and merit the remission of 
sins. Thus they have transferred the benefit of Christ to human traditions, and have 
altogether extinguished the doctrine concerning faith. They have feigned that the 
most trifling traditions are services of God and perfection and have preferred these 
to the works of callings which God requires and has ordained. Neither are these 
errors to be regarded as light; for they detract from the glory of Christ and bring 
destruction to souls, neither can they be passed by unnoticed.
49] Then to these errors two great sins are added: The first, that he defends these 
errors by unjust cruelty and death-penalties. The second, that he wrests the deci-
sion from the Church, and does not permit ecclesiastical controversies [such mat-
A Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope
299
ters of religion] to be judged according to the prescribed mode; yea he contends 
that he is above the Council, and can rescind the decrees of Councils, as the canons 
sometimes impudently speak. But that this was much more impudently done by 
the pontiffs, examples testify.
50] Quest. 9, canon 3, says: No one shall judge the first seat; for the judge is judged nei-
ther by the emperor, nor by all the clergy, nor by the kings, nor by the people.
51] The Pope exercises a twofold tyranny: he defends his errors by force and by 
murders, and forbids judicial examination. The latter does even more injury than 
any executions, because, when the true judgment of the Church is removed, godless 
dogmas and godless services cannot be removed, and for many ages they destroy 
innumerable souls.
52] Therefore let the godly consider the great errors of the kingdom of the Pope 
and his tyranny, and let them ponder, first, that the errors must be rejected and the 
true doctrine embraced, for the glory of God and to the salvation of souls. 53] Then 
let them ponder also how great a crime it is to aid unjust cruelty in killing saints, 
whose blood God will undoubtedly avenge.
54] But especially the chief members of the Church, kings and princes, ought to 
guard the interests of the Church, and to see to it that errors be removed and con-
sciences be healed [rightly instructed], as God expressly exhorts kings, Ps. 2:10: Be 
wise, now, therefore, O ye kings; be instructed, ye judges of the earth. For it should 
be the first care of kings [and great lords] to advance the glory of God. Therefore 
it would be very shameful for them to lend their influence and power to confirm 
idolatry and infinite other crimes, and to slaughter saints.
55] And even though the Pope should hold Synods [a Council], how can the 
Church be healed if the Pope suffers nothing to be decreed contrary to his will, if 
he allows no one to express his opinion except his adherents whom he has bound 
by dreadful oaths and curses to the defense of his tyranny and wickedness without 
any exception concerning God's Word [not even the Word of God being excepted]?
56] But since the decisions of Synods are the decisions of the Church, and not of 
the Popes, it is especially incumbent on kings to check the license of the Popes 
[not allow such wantonness], and to act so that the power of judging and decree-
ing from the Word of God is not wrested from the Church. And as the rest of the 
Christians must censure all other errors of the Pope, so they must also rebuke the 
Pope when he evades and impedes the true investigation and true decision of the 
Church.
The Lutheran Confessions
300
57] Therefore, even though the bishop of Rome had the primacy by divine right, 
yet since he defends godless services and doctrine conflicting with the Gospel, 
obedience is not due him; yea, it is necessary to resist him as Antichrist. The errors 
of the Pope are manifest and not trifling.
58] Manifest also is the cruelty [against godly Christians] which he exercises. And 
it is clear that it is God's command that we flee idolatry, godless doctrine, and 
unjust cruelty. On this account all the godly have great, compelling, and manifest 
reasons for not obeying the Pope. And these compelling reasons comfort the godly 
against all the reproaches which are usually cast against them concerning offenses, 
schism, and discord [which they are said to cause].
59] But those who agree with the Pope, and defend his doctrine and [false] services, 
defile themselves with idolatry and blasphemous opinions, become guilty of the 
blood of the godly, whom the Pope [and his adherents] persecutes, detract from 
the glory of God, and hinder the welfare of the Church, because they strengthen 
errors and crimes to all posterity [in the sight of all the world and to the injury of 
all descendants].
Of the Power and Jurisdiction of Bishops.
60] [In our Confession and the Apology we have in general recounted what we 
have had to say concerning ecclesiastical power. For] The Gospel assigns to those 
who preside over churches the command to teach the Gospel to remit sins, to ad-
minister the Sacraments and besides jurisdiction, namely, the command to excom-
municate those whose crimes are known, and again to absolve those who repent.
61] And by the confession of all, even of the adversaries, it is clear that this power 
by divine right is common to all who preside over churches, whether they are 
called pastors, or elders, or bishops. 62] And accordingly Jerome openly teaches in 
the apostolic letters that all who preside over churches are both bishops and elders, 
and cites from Titus 1:5f : For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest or-
dain elders in every city [and afterwards calls these persons bishops]. Then he adds: 
A bishop must be the husband of one wife. Likewise Peter and John call themselves 
elders [or priests] 1 Pet. 5:1; 2 John 1. And he then adds: But that afterwards one was 
chosen to be placed over the rest, this was done as a remedy for schism, lest each 
one by attracting [a congregation here or there] to himself might rend the Church 
of Christ. For at Alexandria, from Mark the evangelist to the bishops Heracles and 
Dionysius, the elders always elected one from among themselves, and placed him in 
a higher station, whom they called bishop; just as an army would make a com-
A Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope
301
mander for itself. The deacons, moreover, may elect from among themselves one 
whom they know to be active, and name him archdeacon. For with the exception 
of ordination, what does the bishop that the elder does not?
63] Jerome, therefore, teaches that it is by human authority that the grades of 
bishop and elder or pastor are distinct. And the subject itself declares this, because 
the power [the office and command] is the same, as he has said above. 64] But 
one matter afterwards made a distinction between bishops and pastors namely, 
ordination, because it was [so] arranged that one bishop should ordain ministers in 
a number of churches.
65] But since by divine authority the grades of bishop and pastor are not diverse, 
it is manifest that ordination administered by a pastor in his own church is valid 
by divine law [if a pastor in his own church ordains certain suitable persons to the 
ministry, such ordination is, according to divine law, undoubtedly effective and 
right].
66] Therefore, when the regular bishops become enemies of the Church, or are un-
willing to administer ordination, the churches retain their own right. [Because the 
regular bishops persecute the Gospel and refuse to ordain suitable persons, every 
church has in this case full authority to ordain its own ministers.]
67] For wherever the Church is, there is the authority [command] to administer 
the Gospel. Therefore it is necessary for the Church to retain the authority to call, 
elect, and ordain ministers. And this authority is a gift which in reality is given 
to the Church, which no human power can wrest from the Church, as Paul also 
testifies to the Ephesians when he says, Eph 4:8: He ascended, He gave gifts to men. 
And he enumerates among the gifts specially belonging to the Church pastors and 
teachers, and adds that such are given for the ministry, for the edifying of the body 
of Christ. Hence, wherever there is a true church, the right to elect and ordain 
ministers necessarily exists. Just as in a case of necessity even a layman absolves, 
and becomes the minister and pastor of another; as Augustine narrates the story 
of two Christians in a ship, one of whom baptized the catechumen, who after Bap-
tism then absolved the baptizer.
68] Here belong the statements of Christ which testify that the keys have been 
given to the Church, and not merely to certain persons, Matt. 18:20: Where two or 
three are gathered together in My name, etc.
The Lutheran Confessions
302
69] Lastly, the statement of Peter also confirms this, 1 Pet. 2:9: Ye are a royal priest-
hood. These words pertain to the true Church, which certainly has the right to 
elect and ordain ministers since it alone has the priesthood.
70] And this also a most common custom of the Church testifies. For formerly the 
people elected pastors and bishops. Then came a bishop, either of that church or a 
neighboring one, who confirmed tho one elected by the laying on of hands; and or-
dination was nothing else than such a ratification. 71] Afterwards new ceremonies 
were added, many of which Dionysius describes. But he is a recent and fictitious 
author, whoever he may be [this book of Dionysius is a new fiction under a false 
title], just as the writings of Clement also are spurious [have a false title and have 
been manufactured by a wicked scoundrel long after Clement]. Then more modern 
writers added [that the bishop said to those whom he was ordaining]: I give thee 
the power to sacrifice for the living and the dead. But not even this is in Dionysius.
72] From all these things it is clear that the Church retains the right to elect and 
ordain ministers. And the wickedness and tyranny of bishops afford cause for 
schism and discord [therefore, if the bishops either are heretics, or will not ordain 
suitable persons, the churches are in duty bound before God, according to divine 
law, to ordain for themselves pastors and ministers. Even though this be now called 
an irregularity or schism, it should be known that the godless doctrine and tyranny 
of the bishops is chargeable with it], because Paul, Gal. 1:7f , enjoins that bishops 
who teach and defend a godless doctrine and godless services should be regarded as 
accursed.
73] We have spoken of ordination, which alone, as Jerome says, distinguished bish-
ops from other elders. Therefore there is need of no discussion concerning the oth-
er duties of bishops. Nor is it indeed necessary to speak of confirmation, nor of the 
consecration of bells [nor other tomfoolery of this kind], which are almost the only 
things which they have retained. Something must be said concerning jurisdiction.
74] It is certain that the common jurisdiction of excommunicating those guilty of 
manifest crimes belongs to all pastors. This they have tyrannically transferred to 
themselves alone, and have applied it to the acquisition of gain. For it is certain 
that the officials, as they are called employed a license not to be tolerated and ei-
ther on account of avarice or because of other wanton desires tormented men and 
excommunicated them without any due process of law. But what tyranny is it for 
the officials in the states to have arbitrary power to condemn and excommunicate 
men without due process of law! 75] And in what kind of affairs did they abuse 
this power? Indeed, not in punishing true offenses, but in regard to the violation of 
fasts or festivals, or like trifles! Only, they sometimes punished adulteries; and in 
A Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope
303
this matter they often vexed [abused and defamed] innocent and honorable men. 
Besides, since this is a most grievous offense, nobody certainly is to be condemned 
without due process of law.
76] Since, therefore, bishops have tyrannically transferred this jurisdiction to 
themselves alone, and have basely abused it, there is no need, because of this 
jurisdiction, to obey bishops. But since there are just reasons why we do not obey, 
it is right also to restore this jurisdiction to godly pastors [to whom, by Christ's 
command, it belongs], and to see to it that it is legitimately exercised for the refor-
mation of morals and the glory of God.
77] There remains the jurisdiction in those cases which, according to canonical law, 
pertain to the ecclesiastical court, as they call it, and especially in cases of matri-
mony. This, too, the bishops have only by human right, and that, not a very old 
one, as appears from the Codex and Novellae of Justinian that decisions concern-
ing marriage at that time belonged to the magistrates. And by divine right worldly 
magistrates are compelled to make these decisions if the bishops [judge unjustly 
or] are negligent. The canons also concede the same. Therefore, also on account of 
this jurisdiction it is not necessary to obey bishops. 78] And, indeed, since they 
have framed certain unjust laws concerning marriages, and observe them in their 
courts, there is need also for this reason to establish other courts. For the traditions 
concerning spiritual relationship [the prohibition of marriage between sponsors] 
are unjust. Unjust also is the tradition which forbids an innocent person to marry 
after divorce. Unjust also is the law which in general approves all clandestine and 
underhanded betrothals in violation of the right of parents. Unjust also is the law 
concerning the celibacy of priests. There are also other snares of consciences in 
their laws, to recite all of which is of no profit. It is sufficient to have recited this, 
that there are many unjust laws of the Pope concerning matrimonial subjects on 
account of which the magistrates ought to establish other courts.
79] Since, therefore, the bishops, who are devoted to the Pope, defend godless doc-
trine and godless services, and do not ordain godly teachers, yea, aid the cruelty of 
the Pope, and, besides, have wrested the jurisdiction from pastors, and exercise it 
only tyrannically [for their own profit]; and lastly, since in matrimonial cases they 
observe many unjust laws, there are reasons sufficiently numerous and necessary 
why the churches should not recognize these as bishops.
80] But they themselves should remember that riches [estates and revenues] have 
been given to bishops as alms for the administration and advantage of the churches 
[that they may serve the Church, and perform their office the more efficiently], 
as the rule says: The benefice is given because of the office. Therefore they cannot 
The Lutheran Confessions
304
with a good conscience possess these alms, and meanwhile defraud the Church, 
which has need of these means for supporting ministers, and aiding studies [ed-
ucating learned men], and caring for the poor and establishing courts, especially 
matrimonial. 81] For so great is the variety and extent of matrimonial controver-
sies that there is need of a special tribunal for these, and for establishing this, the 
endowments of the Church are needed. 82] Peter predicted, 2 Pet. 2:13, that there 
would be godless bishops, who would abuse the alms of the Church for luxury and 
neglect the ministry. Therefore [since the Holy Spirit in that connection utters dire 
threats] let those who defraud the Church know that they will pay God the penalty 
for this crime.
DOCTORS AND PREACHERS
Who Subscribed the Augsburg Confession and Apology, A. D. 1537.
According to the command of the most illustrious princes and of the orders and 
states professing the doctrine of the Gospel, we have reread the articles of the 
Confession presented to the Emperor in the Assembly at Augsburg, and by the 
favor of God all the preachers who have been present in this Assembly at Smalcald 
harmoniously declare that they believe and teach in their churches according to

the article concerning the primacy of the Pope and his power, and the power and 
jurisdiction of bishops, which was presented to the princes in this Assembly at 
Smalcald. Accordingly, they subscribe their names.

I have read, and again and again reread, the Confession and Apology presented at 
Augsburg by the Most Illustrious Prince, the Elector of Saxony, and by the other 
princes and estates of the Roman Empire, to his Imperial Majesty. I have also read 
the Formula of Concord concerning the Sacrament, made at Wittenberg with Dr. 
Bucer and others. I have also read the articles written at the Assembly at Smalcald 
in the German language by Dr. Martin Luther, our most revered preceptor, and 
the tract concerning the Papacy and the Power and Jurisdiction of Bishops. And in 
my humble opinion I judge that all these agree with Holy Scripture, and with the 
belief of the true and genuine catholic Church. But although in so great a number 
of most learned men who have now assembled at Smalcald I acknowledge that I 
am of all the least yet, as I am not permitted to await the end of the assembly, I ask 
you, most renowned man, Dr. John Bugenhagen, most revered Father in Christ, 
that your courtesy may add my name, if it be necessary, to all that I have above 
mentioned. For I testify in this my own handwriting that I thus hold, confess, and 
constantly will teach, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

The Small Catechism
Luther’s Preface to the Small Catechism
Martin Luther to All Faithful and Godly Pastors and Preachers:
Grace, Mercy, and Peace in Jesus Christ, our Lord.
The deplorable, miserable condition which I discovered lately when I, too, was 
a visitor, has forced and urged me to prepare [publish] this Catechism, or Chris-
tian doctrine, in this small, plain, simple form. Mercy! Good God! what manifold 
misery I beheld! The common people, especially in the villages, have no knowledge 
whatever of Christian doctrine, and, alas! many pastors are altogether incapable 
and incompetent to teach [so much so, that one is ashamed to speak of it]. Never-
theless, all maintain that they are Christians, have been baptized and receive the 
[common] holy Sacraments. Yet they [do not understand and] cannot [even] recite 
either the Lord’s Prayer, or the Creed, or the Ten Commandments; they live like 
dumb brutes and irrational hogs; and yet, now that the Gospel has come, they have 
nicely learned to abuse all liberty like experts.
O ye bishops! [to whom this charge has been committed by God,] what will ye ever 
answer to Christ for having so shamefully neglected the people and never for a mo-
ment discharged your office? [You are the persons to whom alone this ruin of the 
Christian religion is due. You have permitted men to err so shamefully; yours is the 
guilt; for you have ever done anything rather than what your office required you 
to do.] May all misfortune flee you! [I do not wish at this place to invoke evil on 
your heads.] You command the Sacrament in one form [but is not this the highest 
ungodliness coupled with the greatest impudence that you are insisting on the ad-
ministration of the Sacrament in one form only, and on your traditions] and insist 
on your human laws, and yet at the same time you do not care in the least [while 
you are utterly without scruple and concern] whether the people know the Lord’s 
Prayer, the Creed, the Ten Commandments, or any part of the Word of God. Woe, 
woe, unto you forever!
Therefore I entreat [and adjure] you all for God’s sake, my dear sirs and brethren, 
who are pastors or preachers, to devote yourselves heartily to your office, to have 
pity on the people who are entrusted to you, and to help us inculcate the Cate-
chism upon the people, and especially upon the young. And let those of you who 
cannot do better [If any of you are so unskilled that you have absolutely no knowl-
The Lutheran Confessions
308
edge of these matters, let them not be ashamed to] take these tables and forms and 
impress them, word for word, on the people, as follows:–
In the first place, let the preacher above all be careful to avoid many kinds of or 
various texts and forms of the Ten Commandments, the Lord’s Prayer, the Creed, 
the Sacraments, etc., but choose one form to which he adheres, and which he incul-
cates all the time, year after year. For [I give this advice, however, because I know 
that] young and simple people must be taught by uniform, settled texts and forms, 
otherwise they easily become confused when the teacher to-day teaches them thus, 
and in a year some other way, as if he wished to make improvements, and thus all 
effort and labor [which has been expended in teaching] is lost.
Also our blessed fathers understood this well; for they all used the same form of 
the Lord’s Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments. Therefore we, too, 
should [imitate their diligence and be at pains to] teach the young and simple 
people these parts in such a way as not to change a syllable, or set them forth and 
repeat them one year differently than in another [no matter how often we teach 
the Catechism].
Hence, choose whatever form you please, and adhere to it forever. But when you 
preach in the presence of learned and intelligent men, you may exhibit your skill, 
and may present these parts in as varied and intricate ways and give them as mas-
terly turns as you are able. But with the young people stick to one fixed, perma-
nent form and manner, and teach them, first of all, these parts, namely, the Ten 
Commandments, the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, etc., according to the text, word for 
word, so that they, too, can repeat it in the same manner after you and commit it 
to memory.
But those who are unwilling to learn it should be told that they deny Christ and 
are no Christians, neither should they be admitted to the Sacrament, accepted as 
sponsors at baptism, nor exercise any part of Christian liberty, but should simply 
be turned back to the Pope and his officials, yea, to the devil himself. Moreover, 
their parents and employers should refuse them food and drink, and [they would 
also do well if they were to] notify them that the prince will drive such rude people 
from the country, etc.
For although we cannot and should not force any one to believe, yet we should in-
sist and urge the people that they know what is right and wrong with those among 
whom they dwell and wish to make their living. For whoever desires to reside in 
a town must know and observe the town laws, the protection of which he wishes 
The Small Catechism
309
to enjoy, no matter whether he is a believer or at heart and in private a rogue or 
knave.
In the second place, after they have well learned the text, then teach them the sense 
also, so that they know what it means, and again choose the form of these tables, or 
some other brief uniform method, whichever you like, and adhere to it, and do not 
change a single syllable, as was just said regarding the text; and take your time to it. 
For it is not necessary that you take up all the parts at once, but one after the other. 
After they understand the First Commandment well, then take up the Second, and 
so on, otherwise they will be overwhelmed, so as not to be able to retain any well.
In the third place, after you have thus taught them this Short Catechism, then take 
up the Large Catechism, and give them also a richer and fuller knowledge. Here 
explain at large every commandment, [article,] petition, and part with its various 
works, uses, benefits, dangers, and injuries, as you find these abundantly stated in 
many books written about these matters. And particularly, urge that command-
ment or part most which suffers the greatest neglect among your people. For 
instance, the Seventh Commandment, concerning stealing, must be strenuously 
urged among mechanics and merchants, and even farmers and servants, for among 
these people many kinds of dishonesty and thieving prevail. So, too, you must urge 
well the Fourth Commandment among the children and the common people, that 
they may be quiet and faithful, obedient and peaceable, and you must always ad-
duce many examples from the Scriptures to show how God has punished or blessed 
such persons.
Especially should you here urge magistrates and parents to rule well and to send 
their children to school, showing them why it is their duty to do this, and what a 
damnable sin they are committing if they do not do it. For by such neglect they 
overthrow and destroy both the kingdom of God and that of the world, acting as 
the worst enemies both of God and of men. And make it very plain to them what 
an awful harm they are doing if they will not help to train children to be pastors, 
preachers, clerks [also for other offices, with which we cannot dispense in this life], 
etc., and that God will punish them terribly for it. For such preaching is needed. 
[Verily, I do not know of any other topic that deserves to be treated as much as 
this.] Parents and magistrates are now sinning unspeakably in this respect. The dev-
il, too, aims at something cruel because of these things [that he may hurl Germany 
into the greatest distress].
Lastly, since the tyranny of the Pope has been abolished, people are no longer 
willing to go to the Sacrament and despise it [as something useless and unneces-
sary]. Here again urging is necessary, however, with this understanding: We are to 
The Lutheran Confessions
310
force no one to believe, or to receive the Sacrament, nor fix any law, nor time, nor 
place for it, but are to preach in such a manner that of their own accord, without 
our law, they will urge themselves and, as it were, compel us pastors to administer 
the Sacrament. This is done by telling them: Whoever does not seek or desire the 
Sacrament at least some four times a year, it is to be feared that he despises the 
Sacrament and is no Christian, just as he is no Christian who does not believe or 
hear the Gospel; for Christ did not say, This omit, or, This despise, but, This do ye, 
as oft as ye drink it, etc. Verily, He wants it done, and not entirely neglected and 
despised. This do ye, He says.
Now, whoever does not highly value the Sacrament thereby shows that he has no 
sin, no flesh, no devil, no world, no death, no danger, no hell; that is, he does not 
believe any such things, although he is in them over head and ears and is dou-
bly the devil’s own. On the other hand, he needs no grace, life, Paradise, heaven, 
Christ, God, nor anything good. For if he believed that he had so much that is 
evil, and needed so much that is good, he would not thus neglect the Sacrament, 
by which such evil is remedied and so much good is bestowed. Neither will it be 
necessary to force him to the Sacrament by any law, but he will come running and 
racing of his own accord, will force himself and urge you that you must give him 
the Sacrament.
Hence, you must not make any law in this matter, as the Pope does. Only set forth 
clearly the benefit and harm, the need and use, the danger and the blessing, con-
nected with this Sacrament, and the people will come of themselves without your 
compulsion. But if they do not come, let them go and tell them that such belong to 
the devil as do not regard nor feel their great need and the gracious help of God. 
But if you do not urge this, or make a law or a bane of it, it is your fault if they 
despise the Sacrament. How could they be otherwise than slothful if you sleep and 
are silent? Therefore look to it, ye pastors and preachers. Our office is now become 
a different thing from what it was under the Pope; it is now become serious and 
salutary. Accordingly, it now involves much more trouble and labor, danger and 
trials, and, in addition thereto, little reward and gratitude in the world. But Christ 
Himself will be our reward if we labor faithfully. To this end may the Father of 
all grace help us, to whom be praise and thanks forever through Christ, our Lord! 
Amen.

The Lutheran Confessions
312
The Fifth Commandment.

What does this mean?—Answer.

life and body].
The Sixth Commandment.

What does this mean?—Answer.
We should fear and love God that we may lead a chaste and decent life in words

The Seventh Commandment.

What does this mean?—Answer.

protect his property and business [that his means are preserved and his condition is 
improved].
The Eighth Commandment.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
What does this mean?—Answer.
The Small Catechism
313
We should fear and love God that we may not deceitfully belie, betray, slander, or 
defame our neighbor, but defend him, [think and] speak well of him, and put the 
best construction on everything.
The Ninth Commandment.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house.
What does this mean?—Answer.
We should fear and love God that we may not craftily seek to get our neighbor’s 
inheritance or house, and obtain it by a show of [justice and] right, etc., but help

maid-servant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is his.

Answer: He says thus (Exod. 20:5f): I the Lord, thy God, am a jealous God, 
visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth 
generation of them that hate Me, and showing mercy unto thousands of them that 
love Me and keep My commandments.
What does this mean?—Answer.
God threatens to punish all that transgress these commandments. Therefore we 
should dread His wrath and not act contrary to these commandments. But He 
promises grace and every blessing to all that keep these commandments. Therefore 
we should also love and trust in Him, and gladly do [zealously and diligently order 
our whole life] according to His commandments.
The Lutheran Confessions
314
II. The Creed
As the head of the family should teach it in a simple way to his household.
The First Article.
Of Creation.
I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.
What does this mean?—Answer.
I believe that God has made me and all creatures; that He has given me my body 
and soul, eyes, ears, and all my limbs, my reason, and all my senses, and still pre-
serves them; in addition thereto, clothing and shoes, meat and drink, house and 
homestead, wife and children, fields, cattle, and all my goods; that He provides me 
richly and daily with all that I need to support this body and life, protects me from 
all danger, and guards me and preserves me from all evil; and all this out of pure, 
fatherly, divine goodness and mercy, without any merit or worthiness in me; for all 
which I owe it to Him to thank, praise, serve, and obey Him. This is most certainly 
true.
The Second Article.
Of Redemption.
And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy 
Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, 
and buried; He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He 
ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; 
from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
What does this mean?—Answer.
I believe that Jesus Christ, true God, begotten of the Father from eternity, and 
also true man, born of the Virgin Mary, is my Lord, who has redeemed me, a lost 
and condemned creature, purchased and won [delivered] me from all sins, from 
death, and from the power of the devil, not with gold or silver, but with His holy, 
precious blood and with His innocent suffering and death, in order that I may be 
The Small Catechism
315
[wholly] His own, and live under Him in His kingdom, and serve Him in everlast-
ing righteousness, innocence, and blessedness, even as He is risen from the dead, 
lives and reigns to all eternity. This is most certainly true.
The Third Article.
Of Sanctification.
I believe in the Holy Ghost; one holy Christian Church, the communion of saints; 
the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting. Amen.
What does this mean?—Answer.
I believe that I cannot by my own reason or strength believe in Jesus Christ, my 
Lord, or come to Him; but the Holy Ghost has called me by the Gospel, enlight-
ened me with His gifts, sanctified and kept me in the true faith; even as He calls, 
gathers, enlightens, and sanctifies the whole Christian Church on earth, and keeps 
it with Jesus Christ in the one true faith; in which Christian Church He forgives 
daily and richly all sins to me and all believers, and at the last day will raise up me 
and all the dead, and will give to me and to all believers in Christ everlasting life. 
This is most certainly true.
III. The Lord’s Prayer
As the head of the family should teach it in a simple way to his household.
Our Father who art in heaven.
What does this mean?—Answer.
God would thereby [with this little introduction] tenderly urge us to believe that 
He is our true Father, and that we are His true children, so that we may ask Him 
confidently with all assurance, as dear children ask their dear father.
The First Petition.
Hallowed be Thy name.
The Lutheran Confessions
316
What does this mean?—Answer.
God’s name is indeed holy in itself; but we pray in this petition that it may become 
holy among us also.
How is this done?—Answer.
When the Word of God is taught in its truth and purity, and we as the children of 
God also lead holy lives in accordance with it. To this end help us, dear Father in 
heaven. But he that teaches and lives otherwise than God’s Word teaches profanes 
the name of God among us. From this preserve us, Heavenly Father.
The Second Petition.
Thy kingdom come.
What does this mean?—Answer.
The kingdom of God comes indeed without our prayer, of itself; but we pray in this 
petition that it may come unto us also.
How is this done?—Answer.
When our heavenly Father gives us His Holy Spirit, so that by His grace we believe 
His holy Word and lead a godly life here in time and yonder in eternity.
The Third Petition.
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
What does this mean?—Answer.
The good and gracious will of God is done indeed without our prayer; but we pray 
in this petition that it may be done among us also.
How is this done?—Answer.
When God breaks and hinders every evil counsel and will which would not let us 
hallow the name of God nor let His kingdom come, such as the will of the devil, 
The Small Catechism
317
the world, and our flesh; but strengthens and keeps us steadfast in His Word and in 
faith unto our end. This is His gracious and good will.
The Fourth Petition.
Give us this day our daily bread.
What does this mean?—Answer.
God gives daily bread, even without our prayer, to all wicked men; but we pray in 
this petition that He would lead us to know it, and to receive our daily bread with 
thanksgiving.
What is meant by daily bread?—Answer.
Everything that belongs to the support and wants of the body, such as meat, drink, 
clothing, shoes, house, homestead, field, cattle, money, goods, a pious spouse, pious 
children, pious servants, pious and faithful magistrates, good government, good 
weather, peace, health, discipline, honor, good friends, faithful neighbors, and the 
like.
The Fifth Petition.
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
What does this mean?—Answer.
We pray in this petition that our Father in heaven would not look upon our sins, 
nor deny such petitions on account of them; for we are worthy of none of the 
things for which we pray, neither have we deserved them; but that He would grant 
them all to us by grace; for we daily sin much, and indeed deserve nothing but 
punishment. So will we verily, on our part, also heartily forgive and also readily do 
good to those who sin against us.
The Sixth Petition.
And lead us not into temptation.
The Lutheran Confessions
318
What does this mean?—Answer.
God, indeed, tempts no one; but we pray in this petition that God would guard 
and keep us, so that the devil, the world, and our flesh may not deceive us, nor 
seduce us into misbelief, despair, and other great shame and vice; and though we 
be assailed by them, that still we may finally overcome and gain the victory.
The Seventh Petition.
But deliver us from evil.
What does this mean?—Answer.
We pray in this petition, as in a summary, that our Father in heaven would deliver 
us from all manner of evil, of body and soul, property and honor, and at last, when 
our last hour shall come, grant us a blessed end, and graciously take us from this 
vale of tears to Himself into heaven.
Amen.
What does this mean?—Answer.
That I should be certain that these petitions are acceptable to our Father in heaven 
and heard; for He Himself has commanded us so to pray, and has promised that He 
will hear us. Amen, Amen; that is, Yea, yea, it shall be so.
IV. The Sacrament of Holy Baptism
As the head of the family should teach it in a simple way to his household.
First.
What is Baptism?—Answer.
Baptism is not simple water only, but it is the water comprehended in God’s com-
mand and connected with God’s Word.
Which is that word of God?—Answer.
The Small Catechism
319
Christ, our Lord, says in the last chapter of Matthew: Go ye into all the world and 
teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost.
Secondly.
What does Baptism give or profit?—Answer.
It works forgiveness of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and gives eternal 
salvation to all who believe this, as the words and promises of God declare.
Which are such words and promises of God?—Answer.
Christ, our Lord, says in the last chapter of Mark: He that believeth and is baptized 
shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.
Thirdly.
How can water do such great things?—Answer.
It is not the water indeed that does them, but the word of God which is in and 
with the water, and faith, which trusts such word of God in the water. For without 
the word of God the water is simple water and no baptism. But with the word of 
God it is a baptism, that is, a gracious water of life and a washing of regeneration 
in the Holy Ghost, as St. Paul says, Titus, chapter three: By the washing of regen-
eration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus 
Christ, our Savior, that, being justified by His grace, we should be made heirs according to 
the hope of eternal life. This is a faithful saying.
Fourthly.
What does such baptizing with water signify?—Answer.
It signifies that the old Adam in us should, by daily contrition and repentance, 
be drowned and die with all sins and evil lusts, and, again, a new man daily come 
forth and arise; who shall live before God in righteousness and purity forever.
Where is this written?—Answer.
The Lutheran Confessions
320
St. Paul says Romans, chapter 6: We are buried with Christ by Baptism into death, that, 
like as He was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should 
walk in newness of life.
V. Confession
How Christians should be taught to confess.
What is Confession?*
Confession embraces two parts: the one is, that we confess our sins; the other, that 
we receive absolution, or forgiveness, from the confessor, as from God Himself, 
and in no wise doubt, but firmly believe, that our sins are thereby forgiven before 
God in heaven.
What sins should we confess?
Before God we should plead guilty of all sins, even of those which we do not know, 
as we do in the Lord’s Prayer. But before the confessor we should confess those sins 
alone which we know and feel in our hearts.
Which are these?
Here consider your station according to the Ten Commandments, whether you are 
a father, mother, son, daughter, master, mistress, a man-servant or maid-servant; 
whether you have been disobedient, unfaithful, slothful; whether you have grieved 
any one by words or deeds; whether you have stolen, neglected, or wasted aught, or 
done other injury.
Pray, Propose to Me a Brief Form of Confession.
Answer.
You should speak to the confessor thus: Reverend and dear sir, I beseech you to 
hear my confession, and to pronounce forgiveness to me for God’s sake.
*These questions may not have been composed by Luther himself but reflect his teachings 
and were included in editions of the Small Catechism during his lifetime. 
The Small Catechism
321
Proceed!
I, a poor sinner, confess myself before God guilty of all sins; especially I confess 
before you that I am a man-servant, a maidservant, etc. But, alas, I serve my master 
unfaithfully; for in this and in that I have not done what they commanded me; 
I have provoked them, and caused them to curse, have been negligent [in many 
things] and permitted damage to be done; have also been immodest in words and 
deeds, have quarreled with my equals, have grumbled and sworn at my mistress, 
etc. For all this I am sorry, and pray for grace; I want to do better.
A master or mistress may say thus:
In particular I confess before you that I have not faithfully trained my children, 
domestics, and wife [family] for God’s glory. I have cursed, set a bad example by 
rude words and deeds, have done my neighbor harm and spoken evil of him, have 
overcharged and given false ware and short measure.
And whatever else he has done against God’s command and his station, etc.
But if any one does not find himself burdened with such or greater sins, he should 
not trouble himself or search for or invent other sins, and thereby make confession 
a torture, but mention one or two that he knows. Thus: In particular I confess that 
I once cursed; again, I once used improper words, I have once neglected this or 
that, etc. Let this suffice.
But if you know of none at all (which, however is scarcely possible), then mention 
none in particular, but receive the forgiveness upon your general confession which 
you make before God to the confessor.
Then shall the confessor say:
God be merciful to thee and strengthen thy faith! Amen.
Furthermore:
Dost thou believe that my forgiveness is God’s forgiveness?
Answer.
The Lutheran Confessions
322
Yes, dear sir.
Then let him say:
As thou believest, so be it done unto thee. And by the command of our Lord Jesus 
Christ I forgive thee thy sins, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the 
Holy Ghost. Amen. Depart in peace.
But those who have great burdens upon their consciences, or are distressed and 
tempted, the confessor will know how to comfort and to encourage to faith with 
more passages of Scripture. This is to be merely a general form of confession for the 
unlearned.
VI. The Sacrament of the Altar
As the head of the family should teach it in a simple way to his household.
What is the Sacrament of the Altar?
It is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, under the bread and wine, 
for us Christians to eat and to drink, instituted by Christ Himself.
Where is this written?
The holy Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and St. Paul, write thus:
Our Lord Jesus Christ, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread: and when He 
had given thanks, He brake it, and gave it to His disciples, and said,Take, eat; this is My 
body, which is given for you. This do in remembrance of Me.
After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped, gave thanks, and gave it 
to them, saying, Take, drink ye all of it. This cup is the new testament in My blood, which 
is shed for you for the remission of sins. This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of 
Me.
What is the benefit of such eating and drinking?
That is shown us in these words: Given, and shed for you, for the remission of sins; 
namely, that in the Sacrament forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation are given us 
The Small Catechism
323
through these words. For where there is forgiveness of sins, there is also life and 
salvation.
How can bodily eating and drinking do such great things?
It is not the eating and drinking, indeed, that does them, but the words which 
stand here, namely: Given, and shed for you, for the remission of sins. Which words are, 
beside the bodily eating and drinking, as the chief thing in the Sacrament; and he 
that believes these words has what they say and express, namely, the forgiveness of 
sins.
Who, then, receives such Sacrament worthily?
Fasting and bodily preparation is, indeed, a fine outward training; but he is truly 
worthy and well prepared who has faith in these words: Given, and shed for you, for 
the remission of sins.
But he that does not believe these words, or doubts, is unworthy and unfit; for the 
words For you require altogether believing hearts.
Daily Prayers
How the head of the family should teach his household to pray morning and evening
Morning Prayer.
1] In the morning, when you rise, you shall bless yourself with the holy cross and 
say:
In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.
2] Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord’s Prayer. If you 
choose, you may, in addition, say this little prayer:
I thank Thee, my Heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son, that Thou 
hast kept me this night from all harm and danger; and I pray Thee to keep me this 
day also from sin and all evil, that all my doings and life may please Thee. For into 
Thy hands I commend myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Thy holy angel 
be with me, that the Wicked Foe may have no power over me. Amen.
The Lutheran Confessions
324
3] Then go to your work with joy, singing a hymn, as the Ten Commandments, or 
what your devotion may suggest.
Evening Prayer.
4] In the evening, when you go to bed, you shall bless yourself with the holy cross 
and say:
In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.
5] Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord’s Prayer. If you 
choose, you may, in addition, say this little prayer:
I thank Thee, my Heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son, that Thou 
hast graciously kept me this day, and I pray Thee to forgive me all my sins, where I 
have done wrong, and graciously keep me this night. For into Thy hands I com-
mend myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Thy holy angel be with me, that 
the Wicked Foe may have no power over me. Amen.
Then go to sleep promptly and cheerfully.
6] HOW THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY
Should Teach His Household to Ask a Blessing and Return Thanks.
Asking a Blessing
The children and servants shall go to the table with folded hands and reverently, 
and say:
The eyes of all wait upon Thee, O Lord; and Thou givest them their meat in due 
season; Thou openest Thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
Note
To satisfy the desire means that all animals receive so much to eat that they are on 
this account joyful and of good cheer; for care and avarice hinder such satisfaction.
The Small Catechism
325
Then the Lord’s Prayer, and the prayer here following:
Lord God, Heavenly Father, bless us and these Thy gifts, which we take from Thy 
bountiful goodness, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
Returning Thanks.
Likewise also after the meal they shall reverently and with folded hands say:
O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth forever. He 
giveth food to all flesh; He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens 
which cry. He delighteth not in the strength of the horse; He taketh not pleasure 
in the legs of a man. The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that 
hope in His mercy.
Then the Lord’s Prayer and the prayer here following:
We thank Thee, Lord God, Father, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, for all Thy bene-
fits, who livest and reignest forever and ever. Amen.
Table of Duties
Certain passages of scripture for various holy orders and positions, admonishing them about 
their duties and responsibilities
For Bishops, Pastors, and Preachers.
A bishop must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good be-
havior, given to hospitality, apt to teach; not given to wine, no striker, not greedy 
of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; one that ruleth well his 
own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; not a novice; holding 
fast the faithful Word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doc-
trine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers. 1 Tim. 3:2ff; Titus 1:6.
The Lutheran Confessions
326
What the Hearers Owe to Their Pastors.
Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the Gospel should live of 
the Gospel. 1 Cor. 9:14. Let him that is taught in the Word communicate unto him 
that teacheth in all good things. Gal. 6:6. Let the elders that rule well be counted 
worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the Word and doctrine. For 
the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn; and 
the laborer is worthy of his reward. 1 Tim. 5:17-18. Obey them that have the rule 
over you, and submit yourselves; for they watch for your souls as they that must 
give account, that they may do it with joy and not with grief; for that is unprofit-
able for you. Heb. 13:17.]
Concerning Civil Government.
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For the power which exists any-
where is ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance 
of God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation. For he beareth 
not the sword in vain; for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath 
upon him that doeth evil. Rom. 13:1-4.
What Subjects Owe to the Magistrates.
Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s. Matt. 22:21. Let every soul be 
subject unto the higher powers, etc. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only 
for wrath, but also for conscience’ sake. For, for this cause pay ye tribute also; 
for they are God’s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing. Render 
therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom, to whom cus-
tom; fear, to whom fear; honor, to whom honor. Rom. 13:1,5ff. I exhort, therefore, 
that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made 
for all men; for kings and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet 
and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 1 Tim. 2:1f Put them in mind to 
be subject to principalities and powers, etc. Titus 3:1. Submit yourselves to every 
ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake, whether it be to the king as supreme, or unto 
governors as unto them that are sent by him, etc. 1 Pet. 2:13f]
The Small Catechism
327
For Husbands.
Ye husbands, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor unto the 
wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that 
your prayers be not hindered. 1 Pet. 3:7. And be not bitter against them. Col. 3:9.
For Wives.
Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord, even as Sarah 
obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, 
and are not afraid with any amazement. 1 Pet. 3:6; Eph. 5:22.
For Parents.
Ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture 
and admonition of the Lord. Eph. 6:4.
For Children.
Children, obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right. Honor thy father and 
mother; which is the first commandment with promise: that it may be well with 
thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. Eph. 6:1-3.
For Male and Female Servants, Hired Men, and Laborers.
Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with 
fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ; not with eye-service, 
as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; 
with good will doing service as to the Lord, and not to men; knowing that whatso-
ever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he 
be bond or free. Eph. 6:5ff; Col. 3:22.
The Lutheran Confessions
328
For Masters and Mistresses.
Ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening, knowing that 
your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with Him. Eph. 
6:9; Col. 4:1.
For Young Persons in General.
Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject 
one to another, and be clothed with humility; for God resisteth the proud, and 
giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand 
of God that He may exalt you in due time. 1 Pet. 5:5-6.
For Widows.
She that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in sup-
plications and prayers night and day. But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while 
she liveth. 1 Tim. 5:5-6.
For All in Common.
Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Herein are comprehended all the com-
mandments. Rom. 13:8ff. And persevere in prayer for all men. 1 Tim. 2:1-2.
Let each his lesson learn with care,
And all the household well shall fare.
Christian Questions with Their Answers 
Prepared by Dr. Martin Luther for those who intend to go to the Sacrament
[The “Christian Questions with Their Answers,” designating Luther as the author, 
first appeared in an edition of the Small Catechism in 1551, five years after Luther’s 
death].
The Small Catechism
329
After confession and instruction in the Ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lord’s 
Prayer, and the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, the pastor may ask, 
or Christians may ask themselves these questions:
1. Do you believe that you are a sinner?  
    Yes, I believe it. I am a sinner.
2. How do you know this?  
    From the Ten Commandments, which I have not kept.
3. Are you sorry for your sins?  
    Yes, I am sorry that I have sinned against God.
4. What have you deserved from God because of your sins?  
    His wrath and displeasure, temporal death, and eternal damnation. See Romans 
6:21,23.
5. Do you hope to be saved?  
    Yes, that is my hope.
6. In whom then do you trust?  
    In my dear Lord Jesus Christ.
7. Who is Christ?  
    The Son of God, true God and man.
8. How many Gods are there?  
   Only one, but there are three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
9. What has Christ done for you that you trust in Him?  
    He died for me and shed His blood for me on the cross for the forgiveness of 
sins.
10. Did the Father also die for you?  
    He did not. The Father is God only, as is the Holy Spirit; but the Son is both 
true God and true man. He died for me and shed his blood for me.
11. How do you know this?  
    From the holy Gospel, from the words instituting the Sacrament, and by His 
body and blood given me as a pledge in the Sacrament.
The Lutheran Confessions
330
12. What are the Words of Institution?  
    Our Lord Jesus Christ, on the night when He was betrayed, took bread and 
when He had given thanks, He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said: “Take 
eat; this is My body, which is given for you. This do in remembrance of Me.” In the 
same way also He took the cup after supper, and when He had given thanks, He 
gave it to them, saying: “Drink of it, all of you; this cup is the new testament in 
My blood, which is shed for you for the forgiveness of sins. This do, as often as you 
drink it, in remembrance of Me.”
13. Do you believe, then, that the true body and blood of Christ are in the Sacrament?  
    Yes, I believe it.
14. What convinces you to believe this?  
    The word of Christ: Take, eat, this is My body; drink of it, all of you, this is My 
blood.
15. What should we do when we eat His body and drink His blood, and in this way receive 
His pledge?  
    We should remember and proclaim His death and the shedding of His blood, as 
He taught us: This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.
16. Why should we remember and proclaim His death?  
    First, so that we may learn to believe that no creature could make satisfaction 
for our sins. Only Christ, true God and man, could do that. Second, so we may 
learn to be horrified by our sins, and to regard them as very serious. Third, so we 
may find joy and comfort in Christ alone, and through faith in Him be saved.
17. What motivated Christ to die and make full payment for your sins?  
    His great love for His Father and for me and other sinners, as it is written in 
John 14; Romans 5; Galatians 2 and Ephesians 5.
18. Finally, why do you wish to go to the Sacrament?  
    That I may learn to believe that Christ, out of great love, died for my sin, and 
also learn from Him to love God and my neighbor.
19. What should admonish and encourage a Christian to receive the Sacrament frequently?  
    First, both the command and the promise of Christ the Lord. Second, his own 
pressing need, because of which the command, encouragement, and promise are 
given.
The Small Catechism
331
20. But what should you do if you are not aware of this need and have no hunger and thirst 
for the Sacrament?  
    To such a person no better advice can be given than this: first, he should touch 
his body to see if he still has flesh and blood. Then he should believe what the 
Scriptures say of it in Galatians 5 and Romans 7. Second, he should look around to 
see whether he is still in the world, and remember that there will be no lack of sin 
and trouble, as the Scriptures say in John 15-16 and in 1 John 2 and 5. Third, he will 
certainly have the devil also around him, who with his lying and murdering day 
and night will let him have no peace, within or without, as the Scriptures picture 
him in John 8 and 16; 1 Peter 5; Ephesians 6; and 2 Timothy 2.
Note:  
These questions and answers are no child’s play, but are drawn up with great 
earnestness of purpose by the venerable and devout Dr. Luther for both young and 
old. Let each one pay attention and consider it a serious matter; for St. Paul writes 
to the Galatians in chapter six: “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked.”

The Large Catechism
Introduction
A Christian, Profitable, and Necessary Preface, and Faithful, Earnest Exhortation 
of Dr. Martin Luther to All Christians, but Especially to All Pastors and Preachers, 
that They Should Daily Exercise Themselves in the Catechism, which is a Short 
Summary and, Epitome of the Entire Holy Scriptures, and that They May Always 
Teach the Same.
1] We have no slight reasons for treating the Catechism so constantly [in sermons] 
and for both desiring and beseeching others to teach it, since we see to our sorrow 
that many pastors and preachers are very negligent in this, and slight both their 
office and this teaching; some from great and high art (giving their mind, as they 
imagine, to much higher matters], but others from sheer laziness and care for their 
paunches, assuming no other relation to this business than if they were pastors 
and preachers, for their bellies’ sake, and had nothing to do but, to [spend and] 
consume their emoluments as long as they live, as they have been accustomed to do 
under the Papacy.
2] And although they have now everything that they are to preach and teach placed 
before them so abundantly, clearly, and easily, in so many [excellent and] helpful 
books, and the true Sermones per se loquentes, Dormi secure, Paratos et Thesauros, 
as they were called in former times; yet they are not so godly and honest as to buy 
these books, or even when they have them, to look at them or read them. Alas! they 
are altogether shameful gluttons and servants of their own bellies who ought to be 
more properly swineherds and dog-tenders than care-takers of souls and pastors.
3] And now that they are delivered from the unprofitable and burdensome bab-
bling of the Seven Canonical Hours, oh, that, instead thereof, they would only, 
morning, noon, and evening, read a page or two in the Catechism, the Prayer-
book, the New Testament, or elsewhere in the Bible, and pray the Lord’s Prayer for 
themselves and their parishioners, so that they might render, in return, honor and 
thanks to the Gospel, by which they have been delivered from burdens and trou-
bles so manifold, and might feel a little shame because like pigs and dogs they re-
tain no more of the Gospel than such a lazy, pernicious, shameful, carnal liberty! 4] 
For, alas! as it is, the common people regard the Gospel altogether too lightly, and 
we accomplish nothing extraordinary even though we use all diligence. What, then, 
will be achieved if we shall be negligent and lazy as we were under the Papacy?
The Large Catechism
333
5] To this there is added the shameful vice and secret infection of security and sati-
ety, that is, that many regard the Catechism as a poor, mean teaching, which they 
can read through at one time, and then immediately know it, throw the book into 
a corner, and be ashamed, as it were, to read in it again.
6] Yea, even among the nobility there may be found some louts and scrimps, who 
declare that there is no longer any need either of pastors or preachers; that we have 
everything in books, and every one can easily learn it by himself; and so they are 
content to let the parishes decay and become desolate, and pastors and preachers 
to suffer distress and hunger a plenty, just as it becomes crazy Germans to do. For 
we Germans have such disgraceful people, and must endure them.
7] But for myself I say this: I am also a doctor and preacher, yea, as learned and 
experienced as all those may be who have such presumption and security; yet I do 
as a child who is being taught the Catechism, and ever morning, and whenever 
I have time, I read and say, word for word, the Ten Commandments, the Creed, 
the Lord’s Prayer, the Psalms, etc. And I must still read and study daily, and yet I 
cannot master it as I wish, 8] but must remain a child and pupil of the Catechism, 
and am glad so to remain. And yet these delicate, fastidious fellows would with one 
reading promptly be doctors above all doctors, know everything and be in need of 
nothing. Well, this, too, is indeed a sure sign that they despise both their office and 
the souls of the people, yea, even God and His Word. They do not have to fall, they 
are already fallen all too horribly; they would need to become children, and begin 
to learn their alphabet, which they imagine that they have long since outgrown.
9] Therefore I beg such lazy paunches or presumptuous saints to be persuaded 
and believe for God’s sake that they are verily, verily! not so learned or such great 
doctors as they imagine; and never to presume that they have finished learning this 
[the parts of the Catechism], or know it well enough in all points, even though they 
think that they know it ever so well. For though they should know and understand 
it perfectly (which, however, is impossible in this life), yet there are manifold 
benefits and fruits still to be obtained, if it be daily read and practised in thought 
and speech; namely, that the Holy Ghost is present in such reading and repetition 
and meditation, and bestows ever new and more light and devoutness, so that it is 
daily relished and appreciated better, as Christ promises, Matt. 18:20: Where two 
or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them.
10] Besides, it is an exceedingly effectual help against the devil, the world, and the 
flesh and all evil thoughts to be occupied with the Word of God, and to speak of it, 
and meditate upon it, so that the First Psalm declares those blessed who meditate 
upon the Law of God day and night. Undoubtedly, you will not start a stronger 
The Lutheran Confessions
334
incense or other fumigation against the devil than by being engaged upon God’s 
commandments and words, and speaking, singing, or thinking of them. For this is 
indeed the true holy water and holy sign from which he flees, and by which he may 
be driven away.
11] Now, for this reason alone you ought gladly to read, speak, think and treat of 
these things, if you had no other profit and fruit from them than that by doing so 
you can drive away the devil and evil thoughts. For he cannot hear or endure God’s 
Word; and God’s Word is not like some other silly prattle, as that about Dietrich 
of Berne, etc., but as St. Paul says, Rom. 1:16, the power of God. Yea, indeed, the 
power of God which gives the devil burning pain, and strengthens, comforts, and 
helps us beyond measure.
12] And what need is there of many words? If I were to recount all the profit and 
fruit which God’s Word produces, whence would I get enough paper and time? The 
devil is called the master of a thousand arts. But what shall we call God’s Word, 
which drives away and brings to naught this master of a thousand arts with all his 
arts and power? It must indeed be the master of more than a hundred thousand 
arts. 13] And shall we frivolously despise such power, profit, strength, and fruit-we, 
especially, who claim to be pastors and preachers? If so, we should not only have 
nothing given us to eat, but be driven out, being baited with dogs, and pelted with 
dung, because we not only need all this every day as we need our daily bread, but 
must also daily use it against the daily and unabated attacks and lurking of the 
devil, the master of a thousand arts.
14] And if this were not sufficient to admonish us to read the Catechism daily, yet 
we should feel sufficiently constrained by the command of God alone, who solemn-
ly enjoins in Deut. 6:6ff that we should always meditate upon His precepts, sitting, 
walking, standing, lying down, and rising, and have them before our eyes and in 
our hands as a constant mark and sign. Doubtless He did not so solemnly require 
and enjoin this without a purpose; but because He knows our danger and need, as 
well as the constant and furious assaults and temptations of devils, He wishes to 
warn, equip, and preserve us against them, as with a good armor against their fiery 
darts and with good medicine against their evil infection and suggestion.
15] Oh, what mad, senseless fools are we that, while we must ever live and dwell 
among such mighty enemies as the devils are, we nevertheless despise our weapons 
and defense, and are too lazy to look at or think of them!
16] And what else are such supercilious, presumptuous saints, who are unwilling 
to read and study the Catechism daily, doing than esteeming themselves much 
The Large Catechism
335
more learned than God Himself with all His saints, angels, [patriarchs], prophets, 
apostles, and all Christians? For inasmuch as God Himself is not ashamed to teach 
these things daily, as knowing nothing better to teach, and always keeps teaching 
the same thing, and does not take up anything new or different, and all the saints 
know nothing better or different to learn, and cannot finish learning this, are we 
not the finest of all fellows to imagine, if we have once read or heard it, that we 
know it all, and have no further need to read and learn, but can finish learning 
in one hour what God Himself cannot finish teaching, although He is engaged in 
teaching it from the beginning to the end of the world, and all prophets, together 
with all saints, have been occupied with learning it, and have ever remained pupils, 
and must continue to be such?
17] For it needs must be that whoever knows the Ten Commandments perfectly 
must know all the Scriptures, so that, in all affairs and cases, he can advise, help, 
comfort, judge, and decide both spiritual and temporal matters, and is qualified 
to sit in judgment upon all doctrines, estates, spirits, laws, and whatever else is in 
the world. And what, indeed, is the entire Psalter but thoughts and exercises upon 
the First Commandment? 18] Now I know of a truth that such lazy paunches and 
presumptuous spirits do not understand a single psalm, much less the entire Holy 
Scriptures; and yet they pretend to know and despise the Catechism, which is a 
compend and brief summary of all the Holy Scriptures.
19] Therefore I again implore all Christians, especially pastors and preachers, not 
to be doctors too soon, and imagine that they know everything (for imagination 
and cloth unshrunk [and false weights] fall far short of the measure), but that they 
daily exercise themselves well in these studies and constantly treat them; moreover, 
that they guard with all care and diligence against the poisonous infection of such 
security and vain imagination, but steadily keep on reading, teaching, learning, 
pondering, and meditating, and do not cease until they have made a test and are 
sure that they have taught the devil to death, and have become more learned than 
God Himself and all His saints.
20] If they manifest such diligence, then I will promise them, and they shall also 
perceive, what fruit they will obtain, and what excellent men God will make of 
them, so that in due time they themselves will acknowledge that the longer and the 
more they study the Catechism, the less they know of it, and the more they find yet 
to learn; and then only, as hungry and thirsty ones, will they truly relish that which 
now they cannot endure, because of great abundance and satiety. To this end may 
God grant His grace! Amen.
The Lutheran Confessions
336
Short Preface of Dr. Martin Luther
1] This sermon is designed and undertaken that it might be an instruction for chil-
dren and the simple-minded. Hence of old it was called in Greek Catechism, i.e., 
instruction for children, 2] what every Christian must needs know, so that he who 
does not know this could not be numbered with the Christians nor be admitted to 
any Sacrament, just as a mechanic who does not understand the rules and customs 
of his trade is expelled and considered incapable. 3] Therefore we must have the 
young learn the parts which belong to the Catechism or instruction for children 
well and fluently and diligently exercise themselves in them and keep them occu-
pied with them.
4] Therefore it is the duty of every father of a family to question and examine his 
children and servants at least once a week and to ascertain what they know of it, or 
are learning, and, if they do not know it, to keep them faithfully at it. 5] For I well 
remember the time, indeed, even now it is a daily occurrence that one finds rude, 
old persons who knew nothing and still know nothing of these things, and who, 
nevertheless, go to Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, and use everything belonging 
to Christians, notwithstanding that those who come to the Lord’s Supper ought to 
know more and have a fuller understanding of all Christian doctrine than children 
and new scholars. 6] However, for the common people we are satisfied with the 
three parts, which have remained in Christendom from of old, though little of it 
has been taught and treated correctly until both young and old, who are called and 
wish to be Christians, are well trained in them and familiar with them. These are 
the following:
First – THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF GOD.
1] 1. Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.
2] 2. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord, thy God, in vain [for the Lord will 
not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain].
3] 3. Thou shalt sanctify the holy-day. [Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy.]
4] 4. Thou shalt honor thy father and mother [that thou mayest live long upon the 
earth].
5] 5. Thou shalt not kill.
The Large Catechism
337
6] 6. Thou shalt not commit adultery.
7] 7. Thou shalt not steal.
8] 8. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
9] 9. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house.
10] 10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his 
maid-servant, nor his cattle [ox, nor his ass], nor anything that is his.
Secondly – THE CHIEF ARTICLES OF OUR FAITH.
11] 1. I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.
12] 2. And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy 
Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead 
and buried; He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He 
ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; 
from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
13] 3. I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy Christian Church, the communion of 
saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. 
Amen.
14] Thirdly – THE PRAYER, OR “OUR FATHER,” WHICH CHRIST 
TAUGHT.
Our Father who art in heaven.
1. Hallowed be Thy name.
2. Thy kingdom come.
3. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
4. Give us this day our daily bread.
5. And forgive us our trespasses as we for give those who trespass against us.
The Lutheran Confessions
338
6. And lead us not into temptation.
7. But deliver us from evil. [For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, 
forever and ever.] Amen.
15] These are the most necessary parts which one should first learn to repeat word 
for word, 16] and which our children should be accustomed to recite daily when 
they arise in the morning, when they sit down to their meals, and when they retire 
at night; and until they repeat them, they should be given neither food nor drink. 
17] Likewise every head of a household is obliged to do the same with respect 
to his domestics, man-servants and maid-servants, and not to keep them in his 
house if they do not know these things and are unwilling to learn them. 18] For 
a person who is so rude and unruly as to be unwilling to learn these things is not 
to be tolerated; for in these three parts everything that we have in the Scriptures 
is comprehended in short, plain, and simple terms. 19] For the holy Fathers or 
apostles (whoever they were) have thus embraced in a summary the doctrine, life, 
wisdom, and art of Christians, of which they speak and treat, and with which they 
are occupied.
20] Now, when these three parts are apprehended, it behooves a person also to 
know what to say concerning our Sacraments, which Christ Himself instituted, 
Baptism and the holy body and blood of Christ, namely, the text which Matthew 
28:19ff and Mark 16:15f record at the close of their Gospels when Christ said fare-
well to His disciples and sent them forth.
21] OF BAPTISM.
Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the 
Son, and of the Holy Ghost. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but 
he that believeth not shall be damned.
22] So much is sufficient for a simple person to know from the Scriptures concern-
ing Baptism. In like manner, also, concerning the other Sacrament, in short, simple 
words, namely, the text of St. Paul [1 Cor. 11:23f].
The Large Catechism
339
OF THE SACRAMENT.
23] Our Lord Jesus Christ, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread; 
and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and gave it to His disciples and said, 
Take, eat; this is, My body, which is given for you: this do in remembrance of Me.
After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped, gave thanks, 
and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; this cup is the new testament in My 
blood, which is shed for you for the remission of sins: this do ye, as oft as ye drink 
it, in remembrance of Me.
24] Thus would have, in all, five parts of the entire Christian doctrine which 
should be constantly treated and required [of children], and heard recited word for 
word. For you must not rely upon it that the young people will learn and retain 
these things from the sermon alone. 25] When these parts have been well learned, 
you may, as a supplement and to fortify them, lay before them also some psalms or 
hymns, which have been composed on these parts, and thus lead the young into the 
Scriptures, and make daily progress therein.
26] However, it is not enough for them to comprehend and recite these parts ac-
cording to the words only, but the young people should also be made to attend the 
preaching, especially during the time which is devoted to the Catechism, that they 
may hear it explained, and may learn to understand what every part contains, so as 
to be able to recite it as they have heard it, and, when asked, may give a correct an-
swer, so that the preaching may not be without profit and fruit. 27] For the reason 
why we exercise such diligence in preaching the Catechism so often is that it may 
be inculcated on our youth, not in a high and subtile manner, but briefly and with 
the greatest simplicity, so as to enter the mind readily and be fixed in the memory.
28] Therefore we shall now take up the above-mentioned articles one by one and in 
the plainest manner possible say about them as much as is necessary.
The Ten Commandments
The First Commandment.
Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.
The Lutheran Confessions
340
1] That is: Thou shalt have [and worship] Me alone as thy God. What is the force 
of this, and how is it to be understood? What does it mean to have a god? or, what 
is God? 2] Answer: A god means that from which we are to expect all good and 
to which we are to take refuge in all distress, so that to have a God is nothing else 
than to trust and believe Him from the [whole] heart; as I have often said that the 
confidence and faith of the heart alone make both God and an idol. 3] If your faith 
and trust be right, then is your god also true; and, on the other hand, if your trust 
be false and wrong, then you have not the true God; for these two belong together, 
faith and God. That now, I say, upon which you set your heart and put your trust is 
properly your god.
4] Therefore it is the intent of this commandment to require true faith and trust 
of the heart which settles upon the only true God, and clings to Him alone. That 
is as much as to say: “See to it that you let Me alone be your God, and never seek 
another,” i.e.: Whatever you lack of good things, expect it of Me, and look to Me 
for it, and whenever you suffer misfortune and distress, creep and cling to Me. I, 
yes, I, will give you enough and help you out of every need; only let not your heart 
cleave to or rest in any other.
5] This I must unfold somewhat more plainly, that it may be understood and 
perceived by ordinary examples of the contrary. Many a one thinks that he has 
God and everything in abundance when he has money and, possessions; he trusts 
in them and boasts of them with such firmness and assurance as to care for no one. 
6] Lo, such a man also has a god, Mammon by name, i.e., money and possessions, 
on which he sets all his heart, and which is also the most common idol on earth. 
7] He who has money and possessions feels secure, and is joyful and undismayed 
as though he were sitting in the midst of Paradise. 8] On the other hand, he who 
has none doubts and is despondent, as though he knew of no God. 9] For very few 
are to be found who are of good cheer, and who neither mourn nor complain if 
they have not Mammon. This [care and desire for money] sticks and clings to our 
nature, even to the grave.
10] So, too, whoever trusts and boasts that he possesses great skill, prudence, 
power, favor, friendship, and honor has also a god, but not this true and only God. 
This appears again when you notice how presumptuous, secure, and proud people 
are because of such possessions, and how despondent when they no longer exist or 
are withdrawn. Therefore I repeat that the chief explanation of this point is that to 
have a god is to have something in which the heart entirely trusts.
11] Besides, consider what, in our blindness, we have hitherto been practising 
and doing under the Papacy. If any one had toothache, he fasted and honored St. 
The Large Catechism
341
Apollonia [macerated his flesh by voluntary fasting to the honor of St. Apollonia]; 
if he was afraid of fire, he chose St. Lawrence as his helper in need; if he dreaded 
pestilence, he made a vow to St. Sebastian or Rochio, and a countless number of 
such abominations, where every one selected his own saint, worshiped him, and 
called for help to him in distress. 12] Here belong those also, as, e. g., sorcerers 
and magicians, whose idolatry is most gross, and who make a covenant with the 
devil, in order that he may give them plenty of money or help them in love-affairs, 
preserve their cattle, restore to them lost possessions, etc. For all these place their 
heart and trust elsewhere than in the true God, look for nothing good to Him nor 
seek it from Him.
13] Thus you can easily understand what and how much this commandment 
requires, namely, that man’s entire heart and all his confidence be placed in God 
alone, and in no one else. For to have God, you can easily perceive, is not to lay 
hold of Him with our hands or to put Him in a bag [as money], or to lock Him 
in a chest [as silver vessels]. 14] But to apprehend Him means when the heart lays 
hold of Him and clings to Him. 15] But to cling to Him with the heart is nothing 
else than to trust in Him entirely. For this reason He wishes to turn us away from 
everything else that exists outside of Him, and to draw us to Himself, namely, 
because He is the only eternal good. As though He would say; Whatever you have 
heretofore sought of the saints, or for whatever [things] you have trusted in Mam-
mon or anything else, expect it all of Me, and regard Me as the one who will help 
you and pour out upon you richly all good things.
16] Lo, here you have the meaning of the true honor and worship of God, which 
pleases God, and which He commands under penalty of eternal wrath, namely, 
that the heart know no other comfort or confidence than in Him, and do not 
suffer itself to be torn from Him, but, for Him, risk and disregard everything upon 
earth. 17] On the other hand, you can easily see and judge how the world practises 
only false worship and idolatry. For no people has ever been so reprobate as not to 
institute and observe some divine worship; every one has set up as his special god 
whatever he looked to for blessings, help, and comfort.
18] Thus, for example, the heathen who put their trust in power and dominion 
elevated Jupiter as the supreme god; the others, who were bent upon riches, hap-
piness, or pleasure, and a life of ease, Hercules, Mercury, Venus, or others; women 
with child, Diana or Lucina, and so on; thus every one made that his god to which 
his heart was inclined, so that even in the mind of the heathen to have a god means 
to trust and believe. 19] But their error is this, that their trust is false and wrong; 
for it is not placed in the only God, besides whom there is truly no God in heaven 
or upon earth. 20] Therefore the heathen really make their self-invented notions 
The Lutheran Confessions
342
and dreams of God an idol, and put their trust in that which is altogether nothing. 
21] Thus it is with all idolatry; for it consists not merely in erecting an image and 
worshiping it, but rather in the heart, which stands gaping at something else, and 
seeks help and consolation from creatures, saints, or devils, and neither cares for 
God, nor looks to Him for so much good as to believe that He is willing to help, 
neither believes that whatever good it experiences comes from God.
22] Besides, there is also a false worship and extreme idolatry, which we have 
hitherto practised, and is still prevalent in the world, upon which also all ec-
clesiastical orders are founded, and which concerns the conscience alone, that 
seeks in its own works help, consolation, and salvation, presumes to wrest heaven 
from God, and reckons how many bequests it has made, how often it has fasted, 
celebrated Mass, etc. Upon such things it depends, and of them boasts, as though 
unwilling to receive anything from God as a gift, but desires itself to earn or merit 
it superabundantly, just as though He must serve us and were our debtor, and we 
His liege lords. 23] What is this but reducing God to an idol, yea, [a fig image or] 
an apple-god, and elevating and regarding ourselves as God? But this is slightly too 
subtile, and is not for young pupils.
24] But let this be said to the simple, that they may well note and remember the 
meaning of this commandment, namely, that we are to trust in God alone, and 
look to Him and expect from Him naught but good, as from one who gives us 
body, life, food, drink, nourishment, health, protection, peace, and all necessaries 
of both temporal and eternal things. He also preserves us from misfortune, and if 
any evil befall us, delivers and rescues us, so that it is God alone (as has been suf-
ficiently said) from whom we receive all good, and by whom 25] we are delivered 
from all evil. Hence also, I think, we Germans from ancient times call God (more 
elegantly and appropriately than any other language) by that name from the word 
Good, as being an eternal fountain which gushes forth abundantly nothing but 
what is good, and from which flows forth all that is and is called good.
26] For even though otherwise we experience much good from men, still whatev-
er we receive by His command or arrangement is all received from God. For our 
parents, and all rulers, and every one besides with respect to his neighbor, have 
received from God the command that they should do us all manner of good, so 
that we receive these blessings not from them, but, through them, from God. For 
creatures are only the hands, channels, and means whereby God gives all things, 
as He gives to the mother breasts and milk to offer to her child, and corn and all 
manner of produce from the earth for nourishment, none of which blessings could 
be produced by any creature of itself.
The Large Catechism
343
27] Therefore no man should presume to take or give anything except as God has 
commanded, in order that it may be acknowledged as God’s gift, and thanks may 
be rendered Him for it, as this commandment requires. On this account also these 
means of receiving good gifts through creatures are not to be rejected, neither 
should we in presumption seek other ways and means than God has commanded. 
For that would not be receiving from God, but seeking of ourselves.
28] Let every one, then, see to it that he esteem this commandment great and high 
above all things, and do not regard it as a joke. Ask and examine your heart dili-
gently, and you will find whether it cleaves to God alone or not. If you have a heart 
that can expect of Him nothing but what is good, especially in want and distress, 
and that, moreover, renounces and forsakes everything that is not God, then you 
have the only true God. If, on the contrary, it cleaves to anything else, of which it 
expects more good and help than of God, and does not take refuge in Him, but in 
adversity flees from Him, then you have an idol, another god.
29] In order that it may be seen that God will not have this commandment thrown 
to the winds, but will most strictly enforce it, He has attached to it first a terrible 
threat, and then a beautiful, comforting promise which is also to be urged and 
impressed upon young people, that they may take it to heart and retain it:
[Exposition of the Appendix to the First Commandment.]
30] For I am the Lord, thy God, strong and jealous, visiting the iniquity of the 
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate 
Me; and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My com-
mandments.
31] Although these words relate to all the commandments (as we shall hereafter 
learn), yet they are joined to this chief commandment because it is of first impor-
tance that men have a right head; for where the head is right, the whole life must 
be right, and vice versa. 32] Learn, therefore, from these words how angry God is 
with those who trust in anything but Him, and again, how good and gracious He 
is to those who trust and believe in Him alone with the whole heart; so that His 
anger does not cease until the fourth generation, while, on the other hand, His 
blessing and goodness extend to many thousands, 33] lest you live in such security 
and commit yourself to chance, as men of brutal heart, who think that it makes no 
great difference [how they live]. 34] He is a God who will not leave it unavenged 
if men turn from Him, and will not cease to be angry until the fourth generation, 
even until they are utterly exterminated. Therefore He is to be feared, and not to 
be despised.
The Lutheran Confessions
344
35] He has also demonstrated this in all history, as the Scriptures abundantly show 
and daily experience still teaches. For from the beginning He has utterly extirpated 
all idolatry, and, on account of it, both heathen and Jews; even as at the present day 
He overthrows all false worship, so that all who remain therein must finally perish. 
36] Therefore, although proud, powerful, and rich worldlings [Sardanapaluses and 
Phalarides, who surpass even the Persians in wealth] are now to be found, who 
boast defiantly of their Mammon, with utter disregard whether God is angry at or 
smiles on them, and dare to withstand His wrath, yet they shall not succeed, but 
before they are aware, they shall be wrecked, with all in which they trusted; as all 
others have perished who have thought themselves more secure or powerful.
37] And just because of such hardened heads who imagine because God connives 
and allows them to rest in security, that He either is entirely ignorant or cares 
nothing about such matters, He must deal a smashing blow and punish them, so 
that He cannot forget it unto children’s children; so that every one may take note 
and see that this is no joke to Him. 38] For they are those whom He means when 
He says: Who hate Me, i.e., those who persist in their defiance and pride; whatever 
is preached or said to them, they will not listen; when they are reproved, in order 
that they may learn to know themselves and amend before the punishment begins, 
they become mad and foolish so as to fairly merit wrath, as now we see daily in 
bishops and princes.
39] But terrible as are these threatenings, so much the more powerful is the con-
solation in the promise, that those who cling to God alone should be sure that He 
will show them mercy, that is, show them pure goodness and blessing, not only for 
themselves, but also to their children and children’s children, even to the thou-
sandth generation and beyond that. 40] This ought certainly to move and impel us 
to risk our hearts in all confidence with God, if we wish all temporal and eternal 
good, since the Supreme Majesty makes such sublime offers and presents such 
cordial inducements and such rich promises.
41] Therefore let every one seriously take this to heart, lest it be regarded as though 
a man had spoken it. For to you it is a question either of eternal blessing, happi-
ness, and salvation, or of eternal wrath, misery, and woe. What more would you 
have or desire than that He so kindly promises to be yours with every blessing, and 
to protect and help you in all need?
42] But, alas! here is the failure, that the world believes nothing of this, nor regards 
it as God’s Word because it sees that those who trust in God and not in Mammon 
suffer care and want, and the devil opposes and resists them, that they have neither 
money, favor, nor honor, and, besides, can scarcely support life; while, on the other 
The Large Catechism
345
hand, those who serve Mammon have power, favor, honor, possessions, and every 
comfort in the eyes of the world. For this reason, these words must be grasped as 
being directed against such appearances; and we must consider that they do not lie 
or deceive, but must come true.
43] Reflect for yourself or make inquiry and tell me: Those who have employed all 
their care and diligence to accumulate great possessions and wealth, what have they 
finally attained? You will find that they have wasted their toil and labor, or even 
though they have amassed great treasures, they have been dispersed and scattered, 
so that they themselves have never found happiness in their wealth, and afterwards 
it never reached the third generation.
44] Instances of this you will find a plenty in all histories, also in the memory of 
aged and experienced people. Only observe and ponder them.
45] Saul was a great king, chosen of God, and a godly man; but when he was 
established on his throne, and let his heart decline from God, and put his trust in 
his crown and power, he had to perish with all that he had, so that none even of his 
children remained.
46] David, on the other hand, was a poor, despised man, hunted down and chased, 
so that he nowhere felt secure of his life; yet he had to remain in spite of Saul, and 
become king. For these words had to abide and come true, since God cannot lie or 
deceive. Only let not the devil and the world deceive you with their show, which 
indeed remains for a time, but finally is nothing.
47] Let us, then, learn well the First Commandment, that we may see how God will 
tolerate no presumption nor any trust in any other object, and how He requires 
nothing higher of us than confidence from the heart for everything good, so that 
we may proceed right and straightforward and use all the blessings which God 
gives no farther than as a shoemaker uses his needle, awl, and thread for work, and 
then lays them aside, or as a traveler uses an inn, and food, and his bed only for 
temporal necessity, each one in his station, according to God’s order, and without 
allowing any of these things to be our lord or idol. 48] Let this suffice with respect 
to the First Commandment, which we have had to explain at length, since it is 
of chief importance, because, as before said, where the heart is rightly disposed 
toward God and this commandment is observed, all the others follow.
The Lutheran Confessions
346
The Second Commandment.
49] Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord, thy God, in vain.
50] As the First Commandment has instructed the heart and taught [the basis of] 
faith, so this commandment leads us forth and directs the mouth and tongue to 
God. For the first objects that spring from the heart and manifest themselves are 
words. Now, as I have taught above how to answer the question, what it is to have 
a god, so you must learn to comprehend simply the meaning of this and all the 
commandments, and to apply it to yourself.
51] If, then, it be asked: How do you understand the Second Commandment, or 
what is meant by taking in vain, or misusing God’s name? answer briefly thus: It is 
misusing God’s name when we call upon the Lord God, no matter in what way, for 
purposes of falsehood or wrong of any kind. Therefore this commandment enjoins 
this much, that God’s name must not be appealed to falsely, or taken upon the lips, 
while the heart knows well enough, or should know, differently; as among those 
who take oaths in court, where one side lies against the other. 52] For God’s name 
cannot be misused worse than for the support of falsehood and deceit. Let this 
remain the exact German and simplest meaning of this commandment.
53] From this every one can readily infer when and in how many ways God’s name 
is misused, although it is impossible to enumerate all its misuses. Yet, to tell it in 
a few words, all misuse of the divine name occurs, first, in worldly business and in 
matters which concern money, possessions, honor, whether it be publicly in court, 
in the market, or wherever else men make false oaths in God’s name, or pledge 
their souls in any matter. And this is especially prevalent in marriage affairs, where 
two go and secretly betroth themselves to one another, and afterward abjure [their 
plighted troth].
54] But, the greatest abuse occurs in spiritual matters, which pertain to the con-
science, when false preachers rise up and offer their lying vanities as God’s Word.
55] Behold, all this is decking one’s self out with God’s name, or making a pretty 
show, or claiming to be right, whether it occur in gross, worldly business or in sub-
lime, subtile matters of faith and doctrine. And among liars belong also blasphem-
ers, not alone the very gross, well known to every one, who disgrace God’s name 
without fear (these are not for us, but for the hangman to discipline); but also 
those who publicly traduce the truth and God’s Word and consign it to the devil. 
Of this there is no need now to speak further.
The Large Catechism
347
56] Here, then, let us learn and take to heart the great importance of this com-
mandment, that with all diligence we may guard against and dread every misuse of 
the holy name, as the greatest sin that can be outwardly committed. For to lie and 
deceive is in itself a great sin, but is greatly aggravated when we attempt to justify 
it, and seek to confirm it by invoking the name of God and using it as a cloak for 
shame, so that from a single lie a double lie, nay, manifold lies, result.
57] For this reason, too, God has added a solemn threat to this commandment, to 
wit: For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain. That is: 
It shall not be condoned to any one nor pass unpunished. For as little as He will 
leave it unavenged if any one turn his heart from Him, as little will He suffer His 
name to be employed for dressing up a lie. 58] Now, alas! it is a common calam-
ity in all the world that there are as few who are not using the name of God for 
purposes of lying and all wickedness as there are those who with their heart trust 
alone in God.
59] For by nature we all have within us this beautiful virtue, to wit, that whoever 
has committed a wrong would like to cover up and adorn his disgrace, so that no 
one may see it or know it; and no one is so bold as to boast to all the world of the 
wickedness he has perpetrated; all wish to act by stealth and without any one being 
aware of what they do. Then, if any one be arraigned, the name of God is dragged 
into the affair and must make the villainy look like godliness, and the shame like 
honor. This is the common course of the world, which, like a great deluge, has 
flooded all lands. 60] Hence we have also as our reward what we seek and deserve: 
pestilences, wars, famines, conflagrations, floods, wayward wives, children, ser-
vants, and all sorts of defilement. Whence else should so much misery come? It is 
still a great mercy that the earth bears and supports us.
61] Therefore, above all things, our young people should have this commandment 
earnestly enforced upon them, and they should be trained to hold this and the First 
Commandment in high regard; and whenever they transgress, we must at once be 
after them with the rod, and hold the commandment before them, and constant-
ly inculcate it, so as to bring them up not only with punishment, but also in the 
reverence and fear of God.
62] Thus you now understand what it is to take God’s name in vain, that is (to reca-
pitulate briefly), either simply for purposes of falsehood, and to allege God’s name 
for something that is not so, or to curse, swear, conjure, and, in short, to practise 
whatever wickedness one may.
The Lutheran Confessions
348
63] Besides this you must also know how to use the name [of God] aright. For when 
saying: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord, thy God, in vain, He gives us to 
understand at the same time that it is to be used properly. For it has been revealed 
and given to us for the very purpose that it may be of constant use and profit. 64] 
Hence it is a natural inference, since using the holy name for falsehood or wicked-
ness is here forbidden, that we are, on the other hand, commanded to employ it 
for truth and for all good, as when one swears truly where there is need and it is 
demanded. So also when there is right teaching, and when the name is invoked in 
trouble or praised and thanked in prosperity, etc.; all of which is comprehended 
summarily and commanded in the passage Ps. 50:15: Call upon Me in the day of 
trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me. For all this is bringing it into 
the service of truth, and using it in a blessed way, and thus His name is hallowed, as 
we pray in the Lord’s Prayer.
65] Thus you have the sum of the entire commandment explained. And with this 
understanding the question with which many teachers have troubled themselves 
has been easily solved, to wit, why swearing is prohibited in the GospelMatt 
5:24ff, James 5:12; Matt 5:33-37;26:29; Acts 21:20-26, and yet Christ, St. Paul, and 
other saints often swore. 66] The explanation is briefly this: We are not to swear 
in support of evil, that is, of falsehood, and where there is no need or use; but for 
the support of good and the advantage of our neighbor we should swear. For it is a 
truly good work, by which God is praised, truth and right are established, false-
hood is refuted, peace is made among men, obedience is rendered, and quarrels are 
settled. For in this way God Himself interposes and separates between right and 
wrong, good and evil. 67] If one part swears falsely, he has his sentence that he shall 
not escape punishment, and though it be deferred a long time, he shall not succeed; 
so that all that he may gain thereby will slip out of his hands, and he will never 
enjoy it; 68] as I have seen in the case of many who perjured themselves in their 
marriage-vows, that they have never had a happy hour or a healthful day, and thus 
perished miserably in body, soul, and possessions.
69] Therefore I advise and exhort as before that by means of warning and threaten-
ing, restraint and punishment, the children be trained betimes to shun falsehood, 
and especially to avoid the use of God’s name in its support. For where they are 
allowed to do as they please, no good will result, as is even now evident that the 
world is worse than it has ever been, and that there is no government, no obedi-
ence, no fidelity, no faith, but only daring, unbridled men, whom no teaching or 
reproof helps; all of which is God’s wrath and punishment for such wanton con-
tempt of this commandment.
The Large Catechism
349
70] On the other hand, they should be constantly urged and incited to honor God’s 
name, and to have it always upon their lips in everything that may happen to them 
or come to their notice. For that is the true honor of His name, to look to it and 
implore it for all consolation, so that (as we have heard above) first the heart by 
faith gives God the honor due Him, and afterwards the lips by confession.
71] This is also a blessed and useful habit and very effectual against the devil, who 
is ever about us, and lies in wait to bring us into sin and shame, calamity and trou-
ble, but who is very loath to hear God’s name, and cannot remain long where it is 
uttered and called upon from the heart. And, indeed, many a terrible and shocking 
calamity would befall us if, by our calling upon His name, God did not preserve 
us. 72] I have myself tried it, and learned by experience that often sudden great 
calamity was immediately averted and removed during such invocation. To vex the 
devil, I say, we should always have this holy name in our mouth, so that he may not 
be able to injure us as he wishes.
73] For this end it is also of service that we form the habit of daily commending 
ourselves to God, with soul and body, wife, children, servants, and all that we have, 
against every need that may occur; whence also the blessing and thanksgiving at 
meals, and other prayers, morning and evening, have originated and remain in use. 
74] Likewise the practice of children to cross themselves when anything monstrous 
or terrible is seen or heard, and to exclaim: “Lord God, protect us!” “Help, dear 
Lord Jesus!” etc. Thus, too, if any one meets with unexpected good fortune, howev-
er trivial, that he say: “God be praised and thanked; this God has bestowed on me!” 
etc., as formerly the children were accustomed to fast and pray to St. Nicholas and 
other saints. This would be more pleasing and acceptable to God than all monasti-
cism and Carthusian sanctity.
75] Behold, thus we might train our youth, in a childlike way and playfully in the 
fear and honor of God, so that the First and Second Commandments might be 
well observed and in constant practise, Then some good might take root, spring up 
and bear fruit, and men grow up whom 76] an entire land might relish and enjoy. 
Moreover, this would be the true way to bring up children well as long as they can 
become trained with kindness and delight. For what must be enforced with rods 
and blows only will not develop into a good breed, and at best they will remain 
godly under such treatment no longer than while the rod is upon their back.
77] But this [manner of training] so spreads its roots in the heart that they fear 
God more than rods and clubs. This I say with such simplicity for the sake of the 
young, that it may penetrate their minds. For since we are preaching to children, 
we must also prattle with them. Thus we have prevented the abuse and have taught 
The Lutheran Confessions
350
the right use of the divine name, which should consist not only in words, but also 
in practise and life, so that we may know that God is well pleased with this, and 
will as richly reward it as He will terribly punish the abuse.
The Third Commandment.
78] Thou shalt sanctify the holy day. [Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.]
79] The word holy day (Feiertag) is rendered from the Hebrew word sabbath which 
properly signifies to rest, that is, to abstain from labor. Hence we are accustomed 
to say, Feierabend machen [that is, to cease working], or heiligen Abend geben 
[sanctify the Sabbath]. 80] Now, in the Old Testament, God separated the seventh 
day, and appointed it for rest, and commanded that it should be regarded as holy 
above all others. As regards this external observance, this commandment was given 
to the Jews alone, that they should abstain from toilsome work, and rest, so that 
both man and beast might recuperate, and not be weakened by unremitting labor. 
Although they afterwards restricted this too closely, and grossly abused it, so that 
they traduced and could not endure in Christ those works which they themselves 
were accustomed to do on that day, as we read in the Gospel; just as though the 
commandment were fulfilled by doing no external, [manual] work whatever, 
which, however, was not the meaning, but, as we shall hear, that they sanctify the 
holy day or day of rest.
82] This commandment, therefore, according to its gross sense, does not concern us 
Christians; for it is altogether an external matter, like other ordinances of the Old 
Testament, which were attached to particular customs, persons, times, and places, 
and now have been made free through Christ.
83] But to grasp a Christian meaning for the simple as to what God requires in 
this commandment, note that we keep holy days not for the sake of intelligent 
and learned Christians (for they have no need of it [holy days]), but first of all for 
bodily causes and necessities, which nature teaches and requires; for the common 
people, man-servants and maid-servants, who have been attending to their work 
and trade the whole week, that for a day they may retire in order to rest and be 
refreshed.
84] Secondly, and most especially, that on such day of rest (since we can get no 
other opportunity) freedom and time be taken to attend divine service, so that we 
come together to hear and treat of God’s Word, and then to praise God, to sing and 
pray.
The Large Catechism
351
85] However, this, I say, is not so restricted to any time, as with the Jews, that it 
must be just on this or that day; for in itself no one day is better than another; 
but this should indeed be done daily; however, since the masses cannot give such 
attendance, there must be at least one day in the week set apart. But since from of 
old Sunday [the Lord’s Day] has been appointed for this purpose, we also should 
continue the same, in order that everything be done in harmonious order, and no 
one create disorder by unnecessary innovation.
86] Therefore this is the simple meaning of the commandment: since holidays are 
observed anyhow, such observance should be devoted to hearing God’s Word, so 
that the special function of this day should be the ministry of the Word for the 
young and the mass of poor people; yet that the resting be not so strictly interpret-
ed as to forbid any other incidental work that cannot be avoided.
87] Accordingly, when asked, What is meant by the commandment: Thou shalt 
sanctify the holy day? answer: To sanctify the holy day is the same as to keep it 
holy. But what is meant by keeping it holy? Nothing else than to be occupied in 
holy words, works, and life. For the day needs no sanctification for itself; for in 
itself it has been created holy [from the beginning of the creation it was sanctified 
by its Creator]. But God desires it to be holy to you. Therefore it becomes holy or 
unholy on your account, according as you are occupied on the same with things 
that are holy or unholy.
88] How, then, does such sanctification take place? Not in this manner, that [with 
folded hands] we sit behind the stove and do no rough [external] work, or deck 
ourselves with a wreath and put on our best clothes, but (as has been said) that we 
occupy ourselves with God’s Word, and exercise ourselves therein.
89] And, indeed we Christians ought always to keep such a holy day, and be oc-
cupied with nothing but holy things, i.e., daily be engaged upon God’s Word, and 
carry it in our hearts and upon our lips. But (as has been said) since we do not at all 
times have leisure, we must devote several hours a week for the sake of the young, 
or at least a day for the sake of the entire multitude, to being concerned about 
this alone, and especially urge the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and the Lord’s 
Prayer, and thus direct our whole life and being according to God’s Word. 90] At 
what­
ever time, then, this is being observed and practised, there a true holy day 
is being kept; otherwise it shall not be called a Christians’ holy day. For, indeed, 
non-Christians can also cease from work and be idle, just as the entire swarm of 
our ecclesiastics, who stand daily in the churches, singing, and ringing bells but 
keeping no holy day holy, because they neither preach nor practise God’s Word, but 
teach and live contrary to it.
The Lutheran Confessions
352
91] For the Word of God is the sanctuary above all sanctuaries, yea, the only one 
which we Christians know and have. For though we had the bones of all the saints 
or all holy and consecrated garments upon a heap, still that would help us noth-
ing; for all that is a dead thing which can sanctify nobody. But God’s Word is the 
treasure which sanctifies everything, and by which even all the saints themselves 
were sanctified. At whatever hour, then, God’s Word is taught, preached, heard, 
read or meditated upon, there the person, day, and work are sanctified thereby, 
not because of the external work, but because of the Word, which makes saints 
of us all. 92] Therefore I constantly say that all our life and work must be ordered 
according to God’s Word, if it is to be God-pleasing or holy. Where this is done, 
this commandment is in force and being fulfilled.
93] On the contrary, any observance or work that is practised without God’s Word 
is unholy before God, no matter how brilliantly it may shine, even though it be 
covered with relics, such as the fictitious spiritual orders, which know nothing of 
God’s Word and seek holiness in their own works.
94] Note, therefore, that the force and power of this commandment lies not in the 
resting, but in the sanctifying, so that to this day belongs a special holy exercise. 
For other works and occupations are not properly called holy exercises, unless the 
man himself be first holy. But here a work is to be done by which man is himself 
made holy, which is done (as we have heard) alone through God’s Word. For this, 
then, fixed places, times, persons, and the entire external order of worship have 
been created and appointed, so that it may be publicly in operation.
95] Since, therefore, so much depends upon God’s Word that without it no holy 
day can be sanctified, we must know that God insists upon a strict observance of 
this commandment, and will punish all who despise His Word and are not willing 
to hear and learn it, especially at the time appointed for the purpose.
96] Therefore not only those sin against this commandment who grossly misuse 
and desecrate the holy day, as those who on account of their greed or frivolity 
neglect to hear God’s Word or lie in taverns and are dead drunk like swine; but also 
that other crowd, who listen to God’s Word as to any other trifle, and only from 
custom come to preaching, and go away again, and at the end of the year know 
as little of it as at the beginning. 97] For hitherto the opinion prevailed that you 
had properly hallowed Sunday when you had heard a mass or the Gospel read; but 
no one cared for God’s Word, as also no one taught it. Now, while we have God’s 
Word, we nevertheless do not correct the abuse; we suffer ourselves to be preached 
to and admonished, but we listen without seriousness and care.
The Large Catechism
353
98] Know, therefore, that you must be concerned not only about hearing, but also 
about learning and retaining it in memory, and do not think that it is optional 
with you or of no great importance, but that it is God’s commandment, who will 
require of you how you have heard, learned, and honored His Word.
99] Likewise those fastidious spirits are to be reproved who, when they have heard 
a sermon or two, find it tedious and dull, thinking that they know all that well 
enough, and need no more instruction. For just that is the sin which has been 
hitherto reckoned among mortal sins, and is called ajkhdia, i.e., torpor or satiety, 
a malignant, dangerous plague with which the devil bewitches and deceives the 
hearts of many, that he may surprise us and secretly withdraw God’s Word from us.
100] For let me tell you this, even though you know it perfectly and be already 
master in all things, still you are daily in the dominion of the devil, who ceases 
neither day nor night to steal unawares upon you, to kindle in your heart unbelief 
and wicked thoughts against the foregoing and all the commandments. Therefore 
you must always have God’s Word in your heart, upon your lips, and in your ears. 
But where the heart is idle, and the Word does not sound, he breaks in and has 
done the damage before we are aware. 101] On the other hand, such is the effica-
cy of the Word, whenever it is seriously contemplated, heard, and used, that it is 
bound never to be without fruit, but always awakens new understanding, pleasure, 
and devoutness, and produces a pure heart and pure thoughts. For these words are 
not inoperative or dead, but creative, living words. 102] And even though no other 
interest or necessity impel us, yet this ought to urge every one thereunto, because 
thereby the devil is put to Right and driven away, and, besides, this commandment 
is fulfilled, and [this exercise in the Word] is more pleasing to God than any work 
of hypocrisy, however brilliant.
The Fourth Commandment.
103] Thus far we have learned the first three commandments, which relate to God. 
First, that with our whole heart we trust in Him, and fear and love Him through-
out all our life. Secondly, that we do not misuse His holy name in the support of 
falsehood or any bad work, but employ it to the praise of God and the profit and 
salvation of our neighbor and ourselves. Thirdly, that on holidays and when at rest 
we diligently treat and urge God’s Word, so that all our actions and our entire life 
be ordered according to it. Now follow the other seven, which relate to our neigh-
bor, among which the first and greatest is:
104] Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother.
The Lutheran Confessions
354
105] To this estate of fatherhood and motherhood God has given the special dis-
tinction above all estates that are beneath it that He not simply commands us to 
love our parents, but to honor them. For with respect to brothers, sisters, and our 
neighbors in general He commands nothing higher than that we love them, so that 
He separates and distinguishes father and mother above all other persons upon 
earth, and places them at His side. 106] For it is a far higher thing to honor than 
to love one, inasmuch as it comprehends not only love, but also modesty, humility, 
and deference as to a majesty there hidden, 107] and requires not only that they be 
addressed kindly and with reverence, but, most of all, that both in heart and with 
the body we so act as to show that we esteem them very highly, and that, next to 
God, we regard them as the very highest. For one whom we are to honor from the 
heart we must truly regard as high and great.
108] We must, therefore, impress it upon the young that they should regard their 
parents as in God’s stead, and remember that however lowly, poor, frail, and queer 
they may be, nevertheless they are father and mother given them by God. They 
are not to be deprived of their honor because of their conduct or their failings. 
Therefore we are not to regard their persons, how they may be, but the will of God 
who has thus created and ordained. In other respects we are, indeed, all alike in the 
eyes of God; but among us there must necessarily be such inequality and ordered 
difference, and therefore God commands it to be observed, that you obey me as 
your father, and that I have the supremacy.
109] Learn, therefore, first, what is the honor towards parents required by this 
commandment, to wit, that they be held in distinction and esteem above all things, 
as the most precious treasure on earth. 110] Furthermore, that also in our words 
we observe modesty toward them, do not accost them roughly, haughtily, and 
defiantly, but yield to them and be silent, even though they go too far. 111] Thirdly, 
that we show them such honor also by works, that is, with our body and posses-
sions, that we serve them, help them, and provide for them when they are old, sick, 
infirm, or poor, and all that not only gladly, but with humility and reverence, as 
doing it before God. For he who knows how to regard them in his heart will not 
allow them to suffer want or hunger, but will place them above him and at his side, 
and will share with them whatever he has and possesses.
112] Secondly, notice how great, good, and holy a work is here assigned children, 
which is, alas! utterly neglected and disregarded, and no one perceives that God 
has commanded it, or that it is a holy, divine Word and doctrine. For if it had 
been regarded as such, every one could have inferred that they must be holy men 
who live according to these words. Thus there would have been no need of invent-
ing monasticism nor spiritual orders, but every child would have abided by this 
The Large Catechism
355
commandment, and could have directed his conscience to God and said: “If I am 
to do good and holy works, I know of none better than to render all honor and 
obedience to my parents, because God has Himself commanded it. 113] For what 
God commands must be much and far nobler than everything that we may devise 
ourselves; and since there is no higher or better teacher to be found than God, 
there can be no better doctrine, indeed, than He gives forth. Now, He teaches fully 
what we should do if we wish to perform truly good works; and by commanding 
them, He shows that they please Him. If, then, it is God who commands this, and 
who knows not how to appoint anything better, I will never improve upon it.”
114] Behold, in this manner we would have had a godly child properly taught, 
reared in true blessedness, and kept at home in obedience to his parents and in 
their service, so that men should have had blessing and joy from the spectacle. 
However, God’s commandment was not permitted to be thus [with such care and 
diligence] commended, but had to be neglected and trampled under foot, so that 
a child could not lay it to heart, and meanwhile gaped [like a panting wolf] at the 
devices which we set up, without once [consulting or] giving reverence to God.
115] Let us, therefore, learn at last, for God’s sake, that, placing all other things 
out of sight, our youths look first to this commandment, if they wish to serve God 
with truly good works, that they do what is pleasing to their fathers and mothers, 
or to those to whom they may be subject in their stead. For every child that knows 
and does this has, in the first place, this great consolation in his heart, that he can 
joyfully say and boast (in spite of and against all who are occupied with works of 
their own choice): “Behold, this work is well pleasing to my God in heaven, that I 
know for certain.” 116] Let them all come together with their many great, distress-
ing, and difficult works and make their boast; we will see whether they can show 
one that is greater and nobler than obedience to father and mother, to whom God 
has appointed and commanded obedience next to His own majesty; so that if God’s 
Word and will are in force and being accomplished, nothing shall be esteemed 
higher than the will and word of parents; yet so that it, too, is subordinated to 
obedience toward God and is not opposed to the preceding commandments.
117] Therefore you should be heartily glad and thank God that He has chosen you 
and made you worthy to do a work so precious and pleasing to Him. Only see that, 
although it be regarded as the most humble and despised, you esteem it great and 
precious, not on account of our worthiness, but because it is comprehended in, 
and controlled by, the jewel and sanctuary, namely, the Word and commandment 
of God. 118] Oh, what a high price would all Carthusians, monks, and nuns pay, 
if in all their religious doings they could bring into God’s presence a single work 
done by virtue of His commandment, and be able before His face to say with joyful 
The Lutheran Confessions
356
heart: “Now I know that this work is well pleasing to Thee.” Where will these poor 
wretched persons hide when in the sight of God and all the world they shall blush 
with shame before a young child who has lived according to this commandment, 
and shall have to confess that with their whole life they are not worthy to give it 
a drink of water? 119] And it serves them right for their devilish perversion in 
treading God’s commandment under foot that they must vainly torment them-
selves with works of their own device, and, in addition, have scorn and loss for 
their reward.
120] Should not the heart, then, leap and melt for joy when going to work and 
doing what is commanded, saying: Lo, this is better than all holiness of the Car-
thusians, even though they kill themselves fasting and praying upon their knees 
without ceasing? For here you have a sure text and a divine testimony that He has 
enjoined this; but concerning the other He did not command a word. But this is 
the plight and miserable blindness of the world that no one believes these things; 
to such an extent the devil has deceived us with false holiness and the glamour of 
our own works.
121] Therefore I would be very glad (I say it again) if men would open their eyes 
and ears, and take this to heart, lest some time we may again be led astray from the 
pure Word of God to the lying vanities of the devil. Then, too, all would be well; 
for parents would have more joy, love, friendship, and concord in their houses; thus 
the children could captivate their parents’ hearts. 122] On the other hand, when 
they are obstinate, and will not do what they ought until a rod is laid upon their 
back, they anger both God and their parents, whereby they deprive themselves of 
this treasure and joy of conscience, and lay up for themselves only misfortune. 123] 
Therefore, as every one complains, the course of the world now is such that both 
young and old are altogether dissolute and beyond control, have no reverence nor 
sense of honor, do nothing except as they are driven to it by blows, and perpetrate 
what wrong and detraction they can behind each other’s back; therefore God also 
punishes them, that they sink into all kinds of filth and misery. 124] As a rule, the 
parents, too, are themselves stupid and ignorant; one fool trains [teaches] another, 
and as they have lived, so live their children after them.
125] This, now, I say should be the first and most important consideration to urge 
us to the observance of this commandment; on which account, even if we had no 
father and mother, we ought to wish that God would set up wood and stone before 
us, whom we might call father and mother. How much more, since He has given us 
living parents, should we rejoice to show them honor and obedience, because we 
know it is so highly pleasing to the Divine Majesty and to all angels, and vexes all 
devils, and is, besides, 126] the highest work which we can do, after the sublime di-
The Large Catechism
357
vine worship comprehended in the previous commandments; so that giving of alms 
and every other good work toward our neighbor are not equal to this. For God 
has assigned this estate the highest place, yea, has set it up in His own stead, upon 
earth. This will and pleasure of God ought to be a sufficient reason and incentive 
to us to do what we can with good will and pleasure.
127] Besides this, it is our duty before the world to be grateful for benefits and 
every good which we have of our parents. 128] But here again the devil rules in the 
world, so that the children forget their parents, as we all forget God, and no one 
considers how God nourishes, protects, and defends us, and bestows so much good 
on body and soul; especially when an evil hour comes, we are angry and grumble 
with impatience, and all the good which we have received throughout our life is 
wiped out [from our memory]. Just so we do also with our parents, and there is no 
child that understands and considers this [what the parents have endured while 
nourishing and fostering him], except the Holy Ghost grant him this grace.
129] God knows very well this perverseness of the world; therefore He admonishes 
and urges by commandments that every one consider what his parents have done 
for him, and he will find that he has from them body and life, moreover, that he 
has been fed and reared when otherwise he would have perished a hundred times in 
his own filth. 130] Therefore it is a true and good saying of old and wise men: Deo, 
parentibus et magistris non potest satis gratiae rependi, that is, To God, to parents, 
and to teachers we can never render sufficient gratitude and compensation. He 
that regards and considers this will indeed without compulsion do all honor to his 
parents, and bear them up on his hands as those through whom God has done him 
all good.
131] Over and above all this, another great reason that should incite us the more 
[to obedience to this commandment] is that God attaches to this commandment 
a temporal promise and says: That thou mayest live long upon the land which the 
Lord, thy God, giveth thee.
132] Here you can see yourself how much God is in earnest in respect to this 
commandment, inasmuch as He not only declares that it is well pleasing to Him, 
and that He has joy and delight therein; but also that it shall be for our prosperity 
and promote our highest good; so that we may have a pleasant and agreeable life, 
furnished with every good thing. 133] Therefore also St. Paul greatly emphasizes 
the same and rejoices in it when he says, Eph. 6:2-3: This is the first commandment 
with promise: That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the 
earth. For although the rest also have their promises contained in them, yet in none 
is it so plainly and explicitly stated.
The Lutheran Confessions
358
134] Here, then, you have the fruit and the reward, that whoever observes this 
commandment shall have happy days, fortune, and prosperity; and on the other 
hand, the punishment, that whoever is disobedient shall the sooner perish, and 
never enjoy life. For to have long life in the sense of the Scriptures is not only to 
become old, but to have everything which belongs to long life, such as health, wife, 
and children, livelihood, peace, good government, etc., without which this life can 
neither be enjoyed in cheerfulness nor long endure. 135] If, therefore, you will not 
obey father and mother and submit to their discipline, then obey the hangman; 
if you will not obey him, then submit to the skeleton-man, i.e., death [death the 
all-subduer, the teacher of wicked children]. 136] For on this God insists peremp-
torily: Either if you obey Him, rendering love and service, He will reward you 
abundantly with all good, or if you offend Him, He will send upon you both death 
and the hangman.
137] Whence come so many knaves that must daily be hanged, beheaded, broken 
upon the wheel, but from disobedience [to parents], because they will not submit 
to discipline in kindness, so that, by the punishment of God, they bring it about 
that we behold their misfortune and grief? For it seldom happens that such per-
verse people die a natural or timely death.
But the godly and obedient have this blessing, that they live long in pleasant 
quietness, and see their children’s children (as said above) to the third and fourth 
generation.
138] Thus experience also teaches, that where there are honorable, old families who 
fare well and have many children, they owe their origin to the fact, to be sure, that 
some of them were brought up well and were regardful of their parents. On the 
other hand, it is written of the wicked, Ps. 109:13: Let his posterity be cut off; and 
in the generation following let their name be blotted out. 139] Therefore heed well 
how great a thing in God’s sight obedience is, since He so highly esteems it, is so 
highly pleased with it, and rewards it so richly, and besides enforces punishment so 
rigorously on those who act contrariwise.
140] All this I say that it may be well impressed upon the young. For no one be-
lieves how necessary this commandment is, although it has not been esteemed and 
taught hitherto under the papacy. These are simple and easy words, and everybody 
thinks he knew them afore; therefore men pass them lightly by, are gaping after 
other matters, and do not see and believe that God is so greatly offended if they be 
disregarded, nor that one does a work so well pleasing and precious if he follows 
them.
The Large Catechism
359
141] In this commandment belongs a further statement regarding all kinds of obe-
dience to persons in authority who have to command and to govern. For all author-
ity flows and is propagated from the authority of parents. For where a father is un-
able alone to educate his [rebellious and irritable] child, he employs a schoolmaster 
to instruct him; if he be too weak, he enlists the aid of his friends and neighbors; 
if he departs this life, he delegates and confers his authority and government upon 
others who are appointed for the purpose. 142] Likewise, he must have domestics, 
man-servants and maid-servants, under himself for the management of the house-
hold, so that all whom we call masters are in the place of parents and must derive 
their power and authority to govern from them. Hence also they are all called fa-
thers in the Scriptures, as those who in their government perform the functions of 
a father, and should have a paternal heart toward their subordinates. As also from 
antiquity the Romans and other nations called the masters and mistresses of the 
household patres- et matres- familiae, that is, housefathers and housemothers. So 
also they called their national rulers and overlords patres patriae, that is, fathers of 
the entire country, for a great shame to us who would be Christians that we do not 
likewise call them so, or, at least, do not esteem and honor them as such.
143] Now, what a child owes to father and mother, the same owe all who are 
embraced in the household. Therefore man-servants and maid-servants should be 
careful not only to be obedient to their masters and mistresses, but also to honor 
them as their own fathers and mothers, and to do everything which they know is 
expected of them, not from compulsion and with reluctance, but with pleasure and 
joy for the cause just mentioned, namely, that it is God’s command and is pleasing 
to Him above all other works. 144] Therefore they ought rather to pay wages in ad-
dition and be glad that they may obtain masters and mistresses to have such joyful 
consciences and to know how they may do truly golden works; a matter which has 
hitherto been neglected and despised, when, instead, everybody ran, in the devil’s 
name, into convents or to pilgrimages and indulgences, with loss [of time and mon-
ey] and with an evil conscience.
145] If this truth, then, could be impressed upon the poor people, a servant-girl 
would leap and praise and thank God; and with her tidy work for which she re-
ceives support and wages she would acquire such a treasure as all that are esteemed 
the greatest saints have not obtained. Is it not an excellent boast to know and say 
that, if you perform your daily domestic task, this is better than all the sanctity 
and ascetic life of monks? 146] And you have the promise, in addition, that you 
shall prosper in all good and fare well. How can you lead a more blessed or holier 
life as far as your works are concerned? 147] For in the sight of God faith is what 
really renders a person holy, and alone serves Him, but the works are for the 
service of man. 148] There you have everything good, protection and defense in the 
The Lutheran Confessions
360
Lord, a joyful conscience and a gracious God besides, who will reward you a hun-
dredfold, so that you are even a nobleman if you be only pious and obedient. But if 
not, you have, in the first place, nothing but the wrath and displeasure of God, no 
peace of heart, and afterwards all manner of plagues and misfortunes.
149] Whoever will not be influenced by this and inclined to godliness we hand 
over to the hangman and to the skeleton-man. Therefore let every one who allows 
himself to be advised remember that God is not making sport, and know that it is 
God who speaks with you and demands obedience. If you obey Him, you are His 
dear child; but if you despise to do it, then take shame, misery, and grief for your 
reward.
150] The same also is to be said of obedience to civil government, which (as we 
have said) is all embraced in the estate of fatherhood and extends farthest of all 
relations. For here the father is not one of a single family, but of as many people as 
he has tenants, citizens, or subjects. For through them, as through our parents, God 
gives to us food, house and home, protection and security. Therefore, since they 
bear such name and title with all honor as their highest dignity, it is our duty to 
honor them and to esteem them great as the dearest treasure and the most precious 
jewel upon earth.
151] He, now, who is obedient here, is willing and ready to serve, and cheerfully 
does all that pertains to honor, knows that he is pleasing God and that he will 
receive joy and happiness for his reward. If he will not do it in love, but despises 
and resists [authority] or rebels, let him also know, on the other hand, that he shall 
have no favor nor blessing, and where he thinks to gain a florin thereby, he will 
elsewhere lose ten times as much, or become a victim to the hangman, perish by 
war, pestilence, and famine, or experience no good in his children, and be obliged 
to suffer injury, injustice, and violence at the hands of his servants, neighbors, or 
strangers and tyrants; so that what we seek and deserve is paid back and comes 
home to us.
152] If we would ever suffer ourselves to be persuaded that such works are pleasing 
to God and have so rich a reward, we would be established in altogether abundant 
possessions and have what our heart desires. But because the word and command 
of God are so lightly esteemed, as though some babbler had spoken it, let us see 
whether you are the man to oppose Him. How difficult, do you think, it will be 
for Him to recompense you! Therefore you would certainly live much better with 
the divine favor, peace, and happiness than with His displeasure and misfortune. 
154] Why, think you, is the world now so full of unfaithfulness, disgrace, calamity, 
and murder, but because every one desires to be his own master and free from the 
The Large Catechism
361
emperor, to care nothing for any one, and do what pleases him? Therefore God 
punishes one knave by another, so that, when you defraud and despise your master, 
another comes and deals in like manner with you, yea, in your household you must 
suffer ten times more from wife, children, or servants.
155] Indeed, we feel our misfortune, we murmur and complain of unfaithfulness, 
violence, and injustice, but will not see that we ourselves are knaves who have fully 
deserved this punishment, and yet are not thereby reformed. We will have no favor 
and happiness, therefore it is but fair that we have nothing but misfortune without 
mercy. 156] There must still be somewhere upon earth some godly people because 
God continues to grant us so much good! On our own account we should not have 
a farthing in the house nor a straw in the field. 157] All this I have been obliged to 
urge with so many words, in hope that some one may take it to heart, that we may 
be relieved of the blindness and misery in which we are steeped so deeply, and may 
truly understand the Word and will of God, and earnestly accept it. For thence we 
would learn how we could have joy, happiness, and salvation enough, both tempo-
ral and eternal.
158] Thus we have two kinds of fathers presented in this commandment, fathers 
in blood and fathers in office, or those to whom belongs the care of the family, and 
those to whom belongs the care of the country. Besides these there are yet spiritual 
fathers; not like those in the Papacy, who have indeed had themselves called thus, 
but have performed no function of the paternal office. For those only are called 
spiritual fathers who govern and guide us by the Word of God; 159] as St. Paul 
boasts his fatherhood 1 Cor. 4:15, where he says: In Christ Jesus I have begotten you 
through the Gospel. Now, 160] since they are fathers they are entitled to their hon-
or, even above all others. But here it is bestowed least; for the way which the world 
knows for honoring them is to drive them out of the country and to grudge them a 
piece of bread, and, in short, they must be (as says St. Paul, 1 Cor. 4:13) as the filth 
of the world and everybody’s refuse and footrag.
161] Yet there is need that this also be urged upon the populace, that those who 
would be Christians are under obligation in the sight Of God to esteem them 
worthy of double honor who minister to their souls, that they deal well with them 
and provide for them. For that, God is willing to add to you sufficient blessing and 
will not let you come to want. 162] But in this matter every one refuses and resists, 
and all are afraid that they will perish from bodily want, and cannot now support 
one respectable preacher, where formerly they filled ten fat paunches. 163] In this 
we also deserve that God deprive us of His Word and blessing, and again allow 
preachers of lies to arise to lead us to the devil, and, in addition, to drain our sweat 
and blood.
The Lutheran Confessions
362
164] But those who keep in sight God’s will and commandment have the prom-
ise that everything which they bestow upon temporal and spiritual fathers, and 
whatever they do to honor them, shall be richly recompensed to them, so that they 
shall have, not bread, clothing, and money for a year or two, but long life, support, 
and peace, and shall be eternally rich and blessed. 165] Therefore only do what is 
your duty, and let God take care how He is to support you and provide for you 
sufficiently. Since He has promised it, and has never yet lied, He will not be found 
lying to you.
166] This ought indeed to encourage us, and give us hearts that would melt in 
pleasure and love toward those to whom we owe honor, so that we would raise 
our hands and joyfully thank God who has given us such promises, for which we 
ought to run to the ends of the world [to the remotest parts of India]. For although 
the whole world should combine, it could not add an hour to our life or give us a 
single grain from the earth. But God wishes to give you all exceeding abundantly 
according to your heart’s desire. He who despises and casts this to the winds is not 
worthy ever to hear a word of God. This has now been stated more than enough for 
all who belong under this commandment.
167] In addition, it would be well to preach to the parents also, and such as 
bear their office, as to how they should deport themselves toward those who are 
committed to them for their government. For although this is not expressed in 
the Ten Commandments, it is nevertheless abundantly enjoined in many places in 
the Scripture. And God desires to have it embraced in this commandment when 
He speaks of father and mother. 168] For He does not wish to have in this office 
and government knaves and tyrants; nor does He assign to them this honor, that 
is, power and authority to govern, that they should have themselves worshiped; 
but they should consider that they are under obligations of obedience to God; 
and that, first of all, they should earnestly and faithfully discharge their office, not 
only to support and provide for the bodily necessities of their children, servants, 
subjects, etc., but, most of all, to train them to the honor and praise of God. 169] 
Therefore do not think that this is left to your pleasure and arbitrary will, but that 
it is a strict command and injunction of God, to whom also you must give account 
for it.
170] But here again the sad plight arises that no one perceives or heeds this, and 
all live on as though God gave us children for our pleasure or amusement, and 
servants that we should employ them like a cow or ass, only for work, or as though 
we were only to gratify our wantonness with our subjects, ignoring them, as 
though it were no concern of ours what they learn or how they live; 171] and no 
one is willing to see that this is the command of the Supreme Majesty, who will 
The Large Catechism
363
most strictly call us to account and punish us for it; nor that there is so great need 
to be so seriously concerned about the young. 172] For if we wish to have excellent 
and apt persons both for civil and ecclesiastical government, we must spare no 
diligence, time, or cost in teaching and educating our children, that they may serve 
God and the world, 173] and we must not think only how we may amass money 
and possessions for them. For God can indeed without us support and make them 
rich, as He daily does. But for this purpose He has given us children, and issued 
this command that we should train and govern them according to His will, else 
He would have no need of father and mother. Let every one know, therefore, that 
it is his duty, on peril of losing the divine favor, to bring up his children above all 
things in the fear and knowledge of God, and if they are talented, have them learn 
and study something, 174] that they may be employed for whatever need there is 
[to have them instructed and trained in a liberal education, that men may be able 
to have their aid in government and in whatever is necessary].
175] If that were done, God would also richly bless us and give us grace to train 
men by whom land and people might be improved, and likewise well-educated 
citizens, chaste and domestic wives, who afterwards would rear godly children and 
servants. 176] Here consider now what deadly injury you are doing if you be negli-
gent and fail on your part to bring up your child to usefulness and piety, and how 
you bring upon yourself all sin and wrath, thus earning hell by your own children, 
even though you be otherwise pious and holy. 177] And because this is disregard-
ed, God so fearfully punishes the world that there is no discipline, government, or 
peace, of which we all complain, but do not see that it is our fault; for as we train 
them, we have spoiled and disobedient children and subjects. Let this be sufficient 
exhortation; for to draw this out at length belongs to another time.
The Fifth Commandment.
179] Thou shalt not kill.
180] We have now completed both the spiritual and the temporal government, 
that is, the divine and the paternal authority and obedience. But here now we go 
forth from our house among our neighbors to learn how we should live with one 
another, every one himself toward his neighbor. 181] Therefore God and govern-
ment are not included in this commandment, nor is the power to kill, which they 
have, taken away. For God has delegated His authority to punish evil-doers to the 
government instead of parents, who aforetime (as we read in Moses) were required 
to bring their own children to judgment and sentence them to death. Therefore,

what is here forbidden is forbidden to the individual in his relation to any one else, 
and not to the government.
182] Now this commandment is easy enough, and has been often treated, because 
we hear it annually in the Gospel of St. Matthew 5:21ff, where Christ Himself 
explains and sums it up, namely, that we must not kill, neither with hand, heart, 
mouth, signs, gestures, help, nor counsel. Therefore it is here forbidden to every 
one to be angry, except those (as we said) who are in the place of God, that is, 
parents and the government. For it is proper for God and for every one who is in a 
divine estate to be angry, to reprove and punish, namely, on account of those very 
persons who transgress this and the other commandments.
183] But the cause and need of this commandment is that God well knows that the 
world is evil, and that this life has much unhappiness; therefore He has placed this 
and the other commandments between the good and the evil. Now, as there are 
many assaults upon all commandments, so it happens also in this commandment 
that we must live among many people who do us harm, so that we have cause to be 
hostile to them.
184] As when your neighbor sees that you have a better house and home [a larger 
family and more fertile fields], greater possessions and fortune from God than he, 
he is sulky, envies you, and speaks no good of you.
Thus by the devil’s incitement you will get many enemies who cannot bear to see 
you have any good, either bodily or spiritual. When we see such people, our hearts, 
in turn, would rage and bleed and take vengeance. Then there arise cursing and 
blows, from which follow finally misery and murder. Here, now, God like a kind 
father steps in ahead of us, interposes and wishes to have the quarrel settled, that 
no misfortune come of it, nor one destroy another. And briefly, He would hereby 
protect, set free, and keep in peace every one against the crime and violence of 
every one else; and would have this commandment placed as a wall, fortress, and 
refuge about our neighbor, that we do him no hurt nor harm in his body.
186] Thus this commandment aims at this, that no one offend his neighbor on 
account of any evil deed, even though he have fully deserved it. For where murder 
is forbidden, all cause also is forbidden whence murder may originate. For many 
a one, although he does not kill, yet curses and utters a wish, which would stop a 
person from running far if it were to strike him in the neck [makes imprecations, 
which if fulfilled with respect to any one, he would not live long]. 187] Now, since 
this inheres in every one by nature and it is a common practise that no one is 
The Large Catechism
365
willing to suffer at the hands of another, God wishes to remove the root and source 
by which the heart is embittered against our neighbor, and to accustom us ever to 
keep in view this commandment, always to contemplate ourselves in it as in a mir-
ror, to regard the will of God, and with hearty confidence and invocation of His 
name to commit to Him the wrong which we suffer. Thus we shall suffer our ene-
mies to rage and be angry, doing what they can, and we learn to calm our wrath, 
and to have a patient, gentle heart, especially toward those who give us cause to be 
angry, that is, our enemies.
188] Therefore the entire sum of what it means not to kill is to be impressed most 
explicitly upon the simple-minded. In the first place, that we harm no one, first, 
with our hand or by deed. Then, that we do not employ our tongue to instigate 
or counsel thereto. Further, that we neither use nor assent to any kind of means 
or methods whereby any one may be injured. And finally, that the heart be not ill 
disposed toward any one, nor from anger and hatred wish him ill, so that body and 
soul may be innocent in regard to every one, but especially those who wish you evil 
or inflict such upon you. For to do evil to one who wishes and does you good is not 
human, but diabolical.
189] Secondly, under this commandment not only he is guilty who does evil to his 
neighbor, but he also who can do him good, prevent, resist evil, defend and save 
him, so that no bodily harm or hurt happen to him, and yet does not do it. 190] If, 
therefore, you send away one that is naked when you could clothe him, you have 
caused him to freeze to death; if you see one suffer hunger and do not give him 
food, you have caused him to starve. So also, if you see any one innocently sen-
tenced to death or in like distress, and do not save him, although you know ways 
and means to do so, you have killed him. And it will not avail you to make the pre-
text that you did not afford any help, counsel, or aid thereto, for you have withheld 
your love from him and deprived him of the benefit whereby his life would have 
been saved.
191] Therefore God also rightly calls all those murderers who do not afford counsel 
and help in distress and danger of body and life, and will pass a most terrible sen-
tence upon them in the last day, as Christ Himself has announced when He shall 
say, Matt. 25:42f : I was an hungred, and ye gave Me no meat; I was thirsty, and ye 
gave Me no drink; I was a stranger, and ye took Me not in; naked, and ye clothed 
Me not; sick and in prison, and ye visited Me not. That is: You would have suffered 
Me and Mine to die of hunger, thirst, and cold, would have suffered the wild beasts 
to tear us to pieces, or left us to rot in prison or perish in distress. What else is 
that but to reproach them 192] as murderers and bloodhounds? For although you 
The Lutheran Confessions
366
have not actually done all this, you have nevertheless, so far as you were concerned, 
suffered him to pine and perish in misfortune.
It is just as if I saw some one navigating and laboring in deep water [and struggling 
against adverse winds] or one fallen into fire, and could extend to him the hand to 
pull him out and save him, and yet refused to do it. What else would I appear, even 
in the eyes of the world, than as a murderer and a criminal?
193] Therefore it is God’s ultimate purpose that we suffer harm to befall no man, 
but show him all good and love; 194] and, as we have said, it is specially directed 
toward those who are our enemies. For to do good to our friends is but an ordinary 
heathen virtue, as Christ says Matt. 5:46.
195] Here we have again the Word of God whereby He would encourage and urge 
us to true noble and sublime works, as gentleness, patience, and, in short, love and 
kindness to our enemies, and would ever remind us to reflect upon the First Com-
mandment, that He is our God, that is, that He will help, assist, and protect us, in 
order that He may thus quench the desire of revenge in us.
196] This we ought to practise and inculcate, and we would have our hands full 
doing good works. 197] But this would not be preaching for monks; it would 
greatly detract from the religious estate, and infringe upon the sanctity of Car-
thusians, and would even be regarded as forbidding good works and clearing the 
convents. For in this wise the ordinary state of Christians would be considered just 
as worthy, and even worthier, and everybody would see how they mock and delude 
the world with a false, hypocritical show of holiness, because they have given this 
and other commandments to the winds, and have esteemed them unnecessary, as 
though they were not commandments, but mere counsels; and have at the same 
time shamelessly proclaimed and boasted their hypocritical estate and works as 
the most perfect life, in order that they might lead a pleasant, easy life, without 
the cross and without patience, for which reason, too, they have resorted to the 
cloisters, so that they might not be obliged to suffer any wrong from any one or 
to do him any good. 198] But know now that these are the true, holy, and godly 
works, in which, with all the angels, He rejoices, in comparison with which all 
human holiness is but stench and filth, and, besides, deserves nothing but wrath 
and damnation.
The Sixth Commandment.
199] Thou shalt not commit adultery.
The Large Catechism
367
200] These commandments now [that follow] are easily understood from [the 
explanation of] the preceding; for they are all to the effect that we [be careful 
to] avoid doing any kind of injury to our neighbor. But they are arranged in fine 
[elegant] order. In the first place, they treat of his own person. Then they proceed 
to the person nearest him, or the closest possession next after his body, namely, 
his wife, who is one flesh and blood with him, so that we cannot inflict a higher 
injury upon him in any good that is his. Therefore it is explicitly forbidden here 
to bring any disgrace upon him in respect to his wife. 201] And it really aims at 
adultery, because among the Jews it was ordained and commanded that every one 
must be married. Therefore also the young were early provided for [married], so 
that the virgin state was held in small esteem, neither were public prostitution and 
lewdness tolerated (as now). Therefore adultery was the most common form of 
unchastity among them.
202] But because among us there is such a shameful mess and the very dregs of all 
vice and lewdness, this commandment is directed also against all manner of un-
chastity, whatever it may be called; 203] and not only is the external act forbidden, 
but also every kind of cause, incitement, and means, so that the heart, the lips, 
and the whole body may be chaste and afford no opportunity, help, or persuasion 
to inchastity. 204] And not only this, but that we also make resistance, afford 
protection and rescue wherever there is danger and need; and again, that we give 
help and counsel, so as to maintain our neighbor’s honor. For whenever you omit 
this when you could make resistance, or connive at it as if it did not concern you, 
you are as truly guilty as the one perpetrating the deed. 205] Thus, to state it in 
the briefest manner, there is required this much, that every one both live chastely 
himself and help his neighbor do the same, so that God by this commandment 
wishes to hedge round about and protect [as with a rampart] every spouse that no 
one trespass against them.
206] But since this commandment is aimed directly at the state of matrimony and 
gives occasion to speak of the same, you must well understand and mark, first, 
how gloriously God honors and extols this estate, inasmuch as by His command-
ment He both sanctions and guards it. He has sanctioned it above in the Fourth 
Commandment: Honor thy father and thy mother; but here He has (as we said) 
hedged it about and protected it. 207] Therefore He also wishes us to honor it, 
and to maintain and conduct it as a divine and blessed estate; because, in the first 
place, He has instituted it before all others, and therefore created man and woman 
separately (as is evident), not for lewdness, but that they should [legitimately] live 
together, be fruitful, beget children, and nourish and train them to the honor of 
God.
The Lutheran Confessions
368
208] Therefore God has also most richly blessed this estate above all others, and, in 
addition, has bestowed on it and wrapped up in it everything in the world, to the 
end that this estate might be well and richly provided for. Married life is therefore 
no jest or presumption; but it is an excellent thing and a matter of divine serious-
ness. For it is of the highest importance to Him that persons be raised who may 
serve the world and promote the knowledge of God, godly living, and all virtues, to 
fight against wickedness and the devil.
209] Therefore I have always taught that this estate should not be despised nor 
held in disrepute, as is done by the blind world and our false ecclesiastics, but that 
it be regarded according to God’s Word, by which it is adorned and sanctified, so 
that it is not only placed on an equality with other estates, but that it precedes and 
surpasses them all, whether they be that of emperor, princes, bishops, or whoever 
they please. For both ecclesiastical and civil estates must humble themselves and all 
be found in this estate, as we shall hear. 210] Therefore it is not a peculiar estate, 
but the most common and noblest estate, which pervades all Christendom, yea 
which extends through all the world.
211] In the second place, you must know also that it is not only an honorable, but 
also a necessary state, and it is solemnly commanded by God that, in general, in all 
conditions, men and women, who were created for it, shall be found in this estate; 
yet with some exceptions (although few) whom God has especially excepted, so 
that they are not fit for the married estate, or whom He has released by a high, su-
pernatural gift that they can maintain chastity without this estate. 212] For where 
nature has its course, as it is implanted by God, it is not possible to remain chaste 
without marriage. For flesh and blood remain flesh and blood, and the natural in-
clination and excitement have their course without let or hindrance, as everybody 
sees and feels. In order, therefore, that it may be the more easy in some degree to 
avoid inchastity, God has commanded the estate of matrimony, that every one may 
have his proper portion and be satisfied therewith; although God’s grace besides is 
required in order that the heart also may be pure.
213] From this you see how this popish rabble, priests, monks, and nuns, resist 
God’s order and commandment, inasmuch as they despise and forbid matrimony, 
and presume and vow to maintain perpetual chastity, and, besides, deceive the sim-
ple-minded with lying words and appearances [impostures]. 214] For no one has 
so little love and inclination to chastity as just those who because of great sanctity 
avoid marriage, and either indulge in open and shameless prostitution, or secretly 
do even worse, so that one dare not speak of it, as has, alas! been learned too fully. 
215] And, in short, even though they abstain from the act, their hearts are so full 
of unchaste thoughts and evil lusts that there is a continual burning and secret suf-
The Large Catechism
369
fering, which can be avoided in the married life. 216] Therefore all vows of chastity 
out of the married state are condemned by this commandment, and free permis-
sion is granted, yea, even the command is given, to all poor ensnared consciences 
which have been deceived by their monastic vows to abandon the unchaste state 
and enter the married life, considering that even if the monastic life were godly, it 
would nevertheless not be in their power to maintain chastity, and if they remain 
in it, they must only sin more and more against this commandment.
217] Now, I speak of this in order that the young may be so guided that they 
conceive a liking for the married estate, and know that it is a blessed estate and 
pleasing to God. For in this way we might in the course of time bring it about that 
married life be restored to honor, and that there might be less of the filthy, disso-
lute, disorderly doings which now run riot the world over in open prostitution and 
other shameful vices arising from disregard of married life. 218] Therefore it is the 
duty of parents and the government to see to it that our youth be brought up to 
discipline and respectability, and when they have come to years of maturity, to pro-
vide for them [to have them married] in the fear of God and honorably; He would 
not fail to add His blessing and grace, so that men would have joy and happiness 
from the same.
219] Let me now say in conclusion that this commandment demands not only 
that every one live chastely in thought, word, and deed in his condition, that is, 
especially in the estate of matrimony, but also that every one love and esteem the 
spouse given him by God. For where conjugal chastity is to be maintained, man 
and wife must by all means live together in love and harmony, that one may cher-
ish the other from the heart and with entire fidelity. For that is one of the principal 
points which enkindle love and desire of chastity, so that, where this is found, 
chastity will follow as a matter of course without any command. 220] Therefore 
also St. Paul so diligently exhorts husband and wife to love and honor one another. 
221] Here you have again a precious, yea, many and great good works, of which you 
can joyfully boast, against all ecclesiastical estates, chosen without God’s Word and 
commandment.
The Seventh Commandment.
222] Thou shalt not steal.
223] After your person and spouse temporal property comes next. That also God 
wishes to have protected, and He has commanded that no one shall subtract from, 
or curtail, his neighbor’s possessions. 224] For to steal is nothing else than to get 
The Lutheran Confessions
370
possession of another’s property wrongfully, which briefly comprehends all kinds 
of advantage in all sorts of trade to the disadvantage of our neighbor. Now, this is 
indeed quite a wide-spread and common vice, but so little regarded and observed 
that it exceeds all measure, so that if all who are thieves, and yet do not wish to be 
called such, were to be hanged on gallows, the world would soon be devastated, 
and there would be a lack both of executioners and gallows. For, as we have just 
said, to steal is to signify not only to empty our neighbor’s coffer and pockets, but 
to be grasping in the market, in all stores, booths, wine- and beer- cellars, work-
shops, and, in short, wherever there is trading or taking and giving of money for 
merchandise or labor.
225] As, for instance, to explain this somewhat grossly for the common people, 
that it may be seen how godly we are: When a manservant or maid-servant does 
not serve faithfully in the house, and does damage, or allows it to be done when it 
could be prevented, or otherwise ruins and neglects the goods entrusted to him, 
from indolence, idleness, or malice, to the spite and vexation of master and mis-
tress, and in whatever way this can be done purposely (for I do not speak of what 
happens from oversight and against one’s will), you can in a year abscond thirty, 
forty florins, which if another had taken secretly or carried away, he would be 
hanged with the rope. But here you [while conscious of such a great theft] may even 
bid defiance and become insolent, and no one dare call you a thief.
226] The same I say also of mechanics, workmen, and day-laborers, who all follow 
their wanton notions, and never know enough ways to overcharge people, while 
they are lazy and unfaithful in their work. All these are far worse than sneak-
thieves, against whom we can guard with locks and bolts, or who, if apprehended, 
are treated in such a manner that they will not do the same again. But against these 
no one can guard, no one dare even look awry at them or accuse them of theft, so 
that one would ten times rather lose from his purse. For here are my neighbors, 
good friends, my own servants, from whom I expect good [every faithful and dili-
gent service], who defraud me first of all.
227] Furthermore, in the market and in common trade likewise, this practise is 
in full swing and force to the greatest extent, where one openly defrauds another 
with bad merchandise, false measures, weights, coins, and by nimbleness and queer 
finances or dexterous tricks takes advantage of him; likewise, when one overcharges 
a person in a trade and wantonly drives a hard bargain, skins and distresses him. 
And who can recount or think of all these things? 228] To sum up, this is the com-
monest craft and the largest guild on earth, and if we regard the world throughout 
all conditions of life, it is nothing else than a vast, wide stall, full of great thieves.
The Large Catechism
371
229] Therefore they are also called swivel-chair robbers, land- and highway-rob-
bers, not pick-locks and sneak-thieves who snatch away the ready cash, but who 
sit on the chair [at home] and are styled great noblemen, and honorable, pious 
citizens, and yet rob and steal under a good pretext.
230] Yes, here we might be silent about the trifling individual thieves if we were to 
attack the great, powerful arch-thieves with whom lords and princes keep compa-
ny, who daily plunder not only a city or two, but all Germany. Yea, where should 
we place the head and supreme protector of all thieves, the Holy Chair at Rome 
with all its retinue, which has grabbed by theft the wealth of all the world, and 
holds it to this day?
231] This is, in short, the course of the world: whoever can steal and rob openly 
goes free and secure, unmolested by any one, and even demands that he be hon-
ored. Meanwhile the little sneak-thieves, who have once trespassed, must bear the 
shame and punishment to render the former godly and honorable. But let them 
know that in the sight of God they are the greatest thieves, and that He will punish 
them as they are worthy and deserve.
232] Now, since this commandment is so far-reaching [and comprehensive], as just 
indicated, it is necessary to urge it well and to explain it to the common people, 
not to let them go on in their wantonness and security, but always to place before 
their eyes the wrath of God, and inculcate the same. For we have to preach this 
not to Christians, but chiefly to knaves and scoundrels, to whom it would he more 
fitting for judges, jailers, or Master Hannes [the executioner] to preach. 233] There-
fore let every one know that it is his duty, at the risk of God’s displeasure, not only 
to do no injury to his neighbor, nor to deprive him of gain, nor to perpetrate any 
act of unfaithfulness or malice in any bargain or trade, but faithfully to preserve 
his property for him, to secure and promote his advantage, especially when one 
accepts money, wages, and one’s livelihood for such service.
234] He now who wantonly despises this may indeed pass along and escape the 
hangman, but he shall not escape the wrath and punishment of God; and when 
he has long practised his defiance and arrogance, he shall yet remain a tramp and 
beggar, and, in addition, have all plagues and misfortune. 235] Now you are going 
your way [wherever your heart’s pleasure calls you] while you ought to preserve the 
property of your master and mistress, for which service you fill your crop and maw, 
take your wages like a thief, have people treat you as a nobleman; for there are 
many that are even insolent towards their masters and mistresses, and are unwill-
ing to do them a favor or service by which to protect them from loss.
The Lutheran Confessions
372
236] But reflect what you will gain when, having come into your own property and 
being set up in your home (to which God will help with all misfortunes), it [your 
perfidy] will bob up again and come home to you, and you will find that where you 
have cheated or done injury to the value of one mite, you will have to pay thirty 
again.
237] Such shall be the lot also of mechanics and day-laborers of whom we are now 
obliged to hear and suffer such intolerable maliciousness, as though they were 
noblemen in another’s possessions, and every one were obliged to give them what 
they demand. 238] Just let them continue practising their exactions as long as they 
can; but God will not forget His commandment, and will reward them according 
as they have served, and will hang them, not upon a green gallows, but upon a dry 
one, so that all their life they shall neither prosper nor accumulate anything. 239] 
And indeed, if there were a well-ordered government in the land, such wantonness 
might soon be checked and prevented, as was the custom in ancient times among 
the Romans, where such characters were promptly seized by the pate in a way that 
others took warning.
240] No more shall all the rest prosper who change the open free market into a car-
rion pit of extortion and a den of robbery, where the poor are daily overcharged, 
new burdens and high prices are imposed, and every one uses the market according 
to his caprice, and is even defiant and brags as though it were his fair privilege and 
right to sell his goods for as high a price as he please, and no one had a right to say 
a word against it. 241] We will indeed look on and let these people skin, pinch, 
and hoard, 242] but we will trust in God,-who will, however, do this of His own 
accord,-that, after you have been skinning and scraping for a long time, He will 
pronounce such a blessing on your gains that your grain in the garner, your beer 
in the cellar, your cattle in the stalls shall perish; yea, where you have cheated and 
overcharged any one to the amount of a florin, your entire pile shall be consumed 
with rust, so that you shall never enjoy it.
243] And indeed, we see and experience this being fulfilled daily before our eyes, 
that no stolen or dishonestly acquired possession thrives. How many there are who 
rake and scrape day and night, and yet grow not a farthing richer! And though 
they gather much, they must suffer so many plagues and misfortunes that they can-
not relish it with cheerfulness nor transmit it to their children. 244] But as no one 
minds it, and we go on as though it did not concern us, God must visit us in a dif-
ferent way and teach us manners by imposing one taxation after another, or billet-
ing a troop of soldiers upon us, who in one hour empty our coffers and purses, and 
do not quit as long as we have a farthing left, and in addition, by way of thanks, 
burn and devastate house and home, and outrage and kill wife and children.
The Large Catechism
373
245] And, in short, if you steal much, depend upon it that again as much will 
be stolen from you; and lie who robs and acquires with violence and wrong will 
submit to one who shall deal after the same fashion with him. For God is master of 
this art, that since every one robs and steals from the other, He punishes one thief 
by means of another. Else where should we find enough gallows and ropes?
246] Now, whoever is willing to be instructed, let him know that this is the 
commandment of God, and that it must not be treated as a jest. For although you 
despise us, defraud, steal, and rob, we will indeed manage to endure your haugh-
tiness, suffer, and, according to the Lord’s Prayer, forgive and show pity; for we 
know that the godly shall nevertheless have enough, and you injure yourself more 
than another.
247] But beware of this: When the poor man comes to you (of whom there are 
so many now) who must buy with the penny of his daily wages and live upon it, 
and you are harsh to him, as though every one lived by your favor, and you skin 
and scrape to the bone, and, besides, with pride and haughtiness turn him off to 
whom you ought to give for nothing, he will go away wretched and sorrowful, and 
since he can complain to no one, he will cry and call to heaven, then beware (I say 
again) as of the devil himself. For such groaning and calling will be no jest, but will 
have a weight that will prove too heavy for you and all the world. For it will reach 
Him who takes care of the poor sorrowful hearts, and will not allow them to go 
unavenged. But if you despise this and become defiant, see whom you have brought 
upon you: if you succeed and prosper, you may before all the world call God and 
me a liar.
248] We have exhorted, warned, and protested enough; he who will not heed or be-
lieve it may go on until he learns this by experience. Yet it must be impressed upon 
the young that they may be careful not to follow the old lawless crowd, but keep 
their eyes fixed upon God’s commandment, lest His wrath and punishment come 
upon them too. 249] It behooves us to do no more than to instruct and reprove 
with God’s Word; but to check such open wantonness there is need of the princes 
and government, who themselves would have eyes and the courage to establish and 
maintain order in all manner of trade and commerce, lest the poor be burdened and 
oppressed nor they themselves be loaded with other men’s sins.
250] Let this suffice as an explanation of what stealing is, that it be not taken too 
narrowly, but made to extend as far as we have to do with our neighbors. And 
briefly, in a summary, as in the former commandments, it is herewith forbidden, in 
the first place, to do our neighbor any injury or wrong (in whatever manner sup-
posable, by curtailing, forestalling, and withholding his possessions and property), 
The Lutheran Confessions
374
or even to consent or allow such a thing, but to interpose and prevent it. 251] And, 
on the other hand, it is commanded that we advance and improve his possessions, 
and in case he suffers want, that we help, communicate, and lend both to friends 
and foes.
252] Whoever now seeks and desires good works will find here more than enough 
such as are heartily acceptable and pleasing to God, and in addition are favored 
and crowned with excellent blessings, that we are to be richly compensated for 
all that we do for our neighbor’s good and from friendship; as King Solomon also 
teaches Prov. 19:17: He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and 
that which he hath given will He pay him again. Here, then, you have 253] a rich 
Lord, who is certainly sufficient for you, and who will not suffer you to come short 
in anything or to want; thus you can with a joyful conscience enjoy a hundred 
times more than you could scrape together with unfaithfulness and wrong. Now, 
whoever does not desire the blessing will find wrath and misfortune enough.
The Eighth Commandment.
254] Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
255] Over and above our own body, spouse, and temporal possessions, we have yet 
another treasure, namely, honor and good report [the illustrious testimony of an up-
right and unsullied name and reputation], with which we cannot dispense. For it is 
intolerable to live among men in open shame and general contempt. 256] Therefore 
God wishes the reputation, good name, and upright character of our neighbor to 
be taken away or diminished as little as his money and possessions, that every one 
may stand in his integrity before wife, children, servants, and neighbors. 257] And 
in the first place, we take the plainest meaning of this commandment according to 
the words (Thou shalt not bear false witness), as pertaining to the public courts of 
justice, where a poor innocent man is accused and oppressed by false witnesses in 
order to be punished in his body, property, or honor.
258] Now, this appears as if it were of little concern to us at present; but with the 
Jews it was quite a common and ordinary matter. For the people were organized 
under an excellent and regular government; and where there is still such a gov-
ernment, instances of this sin will not be wanting. The cause of it is that where 
judges, burgomasters, princes, or others in authority sit in judgment, things never 
fail to go according to the course of the world; namely, men do not like to offend 
anybody, flatter, and speak to gain favor, money, prospects, or friendship; and in 
consequence a poor man and his cause must be oppressed, denounced as wrong, 
The Large Catechism
375
and suffer punishment. And it is a common calamity in the world that in courts of 
justice there seldom preside godly men.
259] For to be a judge requires above all things a godly man, and not only a godly, 
but also a wise, modest, yea, a brave and hold man; likewise, to be a witness 
requires a fearless and especially a godly man. For a person who is to judge all 
matters rightly and carry them through with his decision will often offend good 
friends, relatives, neighbors, and the rich and powerful, who can greatly serve or 
injure him. Therefore he must be quite blind, have his eyes and ears closed, neither 
see nor hear, but go straight forward in everything that comes before him, and 
decide accordingly.
260] Therefore this commandment is given first of all that every one shall help 
his neighbor to secure his rights, and not allow them to be hindered or twisted, 
but shall promote and strictly maintain them, no matter whether he be judge or 
witness, and let it pertain to whatsoever it will. 261] And especially is a goal set up 
here for our jurists that they be careful to deal truly and uprightly with every case, 
allowing right to remain right, and, on the other hand, not perverting anything [by 
their tricks and technical points turning black into white and making wrong out 
to be right], nor glossing it over or keeping silent concerning it, irrespective of a 
person’s money, possession, honor, or power. This is one part and the plainest sense 
of this commandment concerning all that takes place in court.
262] Next, it extends very much further, if we are to apply it to spiritual jurisdic-
tion or administration; here it is a common occurrence that every one bears false 
witness against his neighbor. For wherever there are godly preachers and Chris-
tians, they must bear the sentence before the world that they are called heretics, 
apostates, yea, seditious and desperately wicked miscreants. Besides, the Word of 
God must suffer in the most shameful and malicious manner, being persecuted, 
blasphemed, contradicted, perverted, and falsely cited and interpreted. But let 
this pass; for it is the way of the blind world that she condemns and persecutes the 
truth and the children of God, and yet esteems it no sin.
263] In the third place, what concerns us all, this commandment forbids all sins of 
the tongue whereby we may injure or approach too closely to our neighbor. For to 
bear false witness is nothing else than a work of the tongue. Now, whatever is done 
with the tongue against a fellow-man God would have prohibited, whether it be 
false preachers with their doctrine and blasphemy, false judges and witnesses with 
their verdict, or outside of court by lying and evil-speaking. 264] Here belongs 
particularly the detestable, shameful vice of speaking behind a person’s back and 
slandering, to which the devil spurs us on, and of which there would be much to be 
The Lutheran Confessions
376
said. For it is a common evil plague that every one prefers hearing evil to hearing 
good of his neighbor; and although we ourselves are so bad that we cannot suffer 
that any one should say anything bad about us, but every one would much rather 
that all the world should speak of him in terms of gold, yet we cannot bear that the 
best is spoken about others.
Therefore, to avoid this vice we should note that 265] no one is allowed publicly 
to judge and reprove his neighbor, although he may see him sin, unless he have a 
command to judge and to reprove. 266] For there is a great difference between 
these two things, judging sin and knowing sin. You may indeed know it, but you 
are not to judge it. I can indeed see and hear that my neighbor sins, but I have no 
command to report it to others. Now, if I rush in, judging and passing sentence, 
I fall into a sin which is greater than his. But if you know it, do nothing else than 
turn your ears into a grave and cover it, until you are appointed to be judge and to 
punish by virtue of your office.
267] Those, then, are called slanderers who are not content with knowing a thing, 
but proceed to assume jurisdiction, and when they know a slight offense of anoth-
er, carry it into every corner, and are delighted and tickled that they can stir up 
another’s displeasure [baseness], as swine roll themselves in the dirt and root in it 
with the snout. 268] This is nothing else than meddling with the judgment and 
office of God, and pronouncing sentence and punishment with the most severe ver-
dict. For no judge can punish to a higher degree nor go farther than to say: “He is a 
thief, a murderer, a traitor,” etc. Therefore, whoever presumes to say the same of his 
neighbor goes just as far as the emperor and all governments. For although you do 
not wield the sword, you employ your poisonous tongue to the shame and hurt of 
your neighbor.
269] God therefore would have it prohibited, that any one speak evil of another 
even though he be guilty, and the latter know it right well; much less if he do not 
know it, and have it only from hearsay. But you say: 270] Shall I not say it if it 
be the truth? Answer: Why do you not make accusation to regular judges? Ah, I 
cannot prove it publicly, and hence I might be silenced and turned away in a harsh 
manner [incur the penalty of a false accusation]. “Ah, indeed, do you smell the 
roast?” If you do not trust yourself to stand before the proper authorities and to 
make answer, then hold your tongue. But if you know it, know it for yourself and 
not for another. For if you tell it to others, although it be true, you will appear as a 
liar, because you cannot prove it, and you are, besides, acting like a knave. For we 
ought never to deprive any one of his honor or good name unless it be first taken 
away from him publicly.
The Large Catechism
377
271] False witness, then, is everything which cannot be properly proved. 272]
Therefore, what is not manifest upon sufficient evidence no one shall make public 
or declare for truth; and, in short, whatever is secret should be allowed to remain 
secret, or, at any rate, should be secretly reproved, as we shall hear. 273]Therefore, 
if you encounter an idle tongue which betrays and slanders some one, contradict 
such a one promptly to his face, that he may blush; thus many a one will hold 
his tongue who else would bring some poor man into bad repute, from which he 
would not easily extricate himself. For honor and a good name are easily taken 
away, but not easily restored.
274] Thus you see that it is summarily forbidden to speak any evil of our neigh-
bor, however, the civil government, preachers, father and mother excepted, on the 
understanding that this commandment does not allow evil to go unpunished. Now, 
as according to the Fifth Commandment no one is to be injured in body, and yet 
Master Hannes [the executioner] is excepted, who by virtue of his office does his 
neighbor no good, but only evil and harm, and nevertheless does not sin against 
God’s commandment, because God has on His own account instituted that office; 
for He has reserved punishment for His own good pleasure, as He threatens in the 
First Commandment,-just so also, although no one has a right in his own person 
to judge and condemn anybody, yet if they to whose office it belongs fail to do it, 
they sin as well as he who would do so of his own accord, without such office. For 
here necessity requires one to speak of the evil, to prefer charges, to investigate 
and testify; 275] and it is not different from the case of a physician who is some-
times compelled to examine and handle the patient whom he is to cure in secret 
parts. Just so governments, father and mother, brothers and sisters, and other good 
friends, are under obligation to each other to reprove evil wherever it is needful 
and profitable.
276] But the true way in this matter would be to observe the order according to 
the Gospel, Matt. 18:15, where Christ says: If thy brother shall trespass against thee, 
go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone. Here you have a precious 
and excellent teaching for governing well the tongue, which is to be carefully 
observed against this detestable misuse. Let this, then, be your rule, that you do not 
too readily spread evil concerning your neighbor and slander him to others, but 
admonish him privately that he may amend [his life]. Likewise, also, if some one 
report to you what this or that one has done, teach him, too, to go and admonish 
him personally, if he have seen it himself; but if not, that he hold his tongue.
277] The same you can learn also from the daily government of the household. 
For when the master of the house sees that the servant does not do what he ought, 
The Lutheran Confessions
378
he admonishes him personally. But if he were so foolish as to let the servant sit at 
home, and went on the streets to complain of him to his neighbors, he would no 
doubt be told: “You fool, what does that concern us? 278] Why do you not tell it 
to him?” Behold, that would be acting quite brotherly, so that the evil would be 
stayed, and your neighbor would retain his honor. As Christ also says in the same 
place: If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. Then you have done a great 
and excellent work; for do you think it is a little matter to gain a brother? Let all 
monks and holy orders step forth, with all their works melted together into one 
mass, and see if they can boast that they have gained a brother.
279] Further, Christ teaches: But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one 
or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be es-
tablished. So he whom it concerns is always to be treated with personally, and not 
to be spoken of without his knowledge. 280] But if that do not avail, then bring 
it publicly before the community, whether before the civil or the ecclesiastical 
tribunal. For then you do not stand alone, but you have those witnesses with you 
by whom you can convict the guilty one, relying on whom the judge can pronounce 
sentence and punish. This is the right and regular course for checking and reform-
ing a wicked person. 281] But if we gossip about another in all corners, and stir the 
filth, no one will be reformed, and afterwards when we are to stand up and bear 
witness, we deny having said so. 282] Therefore it would serve such tongues right 
if their itch for slander were severely punished, as a warning to others. 283] If you 
were acting for your neighbor’s reformation or from love of the truth, you would 
not sneak about secretly nor shun the day and the light.
284] All this has been said regarding secret sins. But where the sin is quite public 
so that the judge and everybody know it, you can without any sin avoid him and 
let him go, because he has brought himself into disgrace, and you may also publicly 
testify concerning him. For when a matter is public in the light of day, there can be 
no slandering or false judging or testifying; as, when we now reprove the Pope with 
his doctrine, which is publicly set forth in books and proclaimed in all the world. 
For where the sin is public, the reproof also must be public, that every one may 
learn to guard against it.
285] Thus we have now the sum and general understanding of this command-
ment, to wit, that no one do any injury with the tongue to his neighbor, whether 
friend or foe, nor speak evil of him, no matter whether it be true or false, unless it 
be done by commandment or for his reformation, but that every one employ his 
tongue and make it serve for the best of every one else, to cover up his neighbor’s 
sins and infirmities, excuse them, palliate and garnish them with his own reputa-
The Large Catechism
379
tion. 286] The chief reason for this should be the one which Christ alleges in the 
Gospel, in which He comprehends all commandments respecting our neighbor, 
Matt. 7:12: Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.
287] Even nature teaches the same thing in our own bodies, as St. Paul says, 1 Cor. 
12:22: Much more, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are 
necessary; and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable, 
upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more 
abundant comeliness. No one covers his face, eyes, nose, and mouth, for they, being 
in themselves the most honorable members which we have, do not require it. But 
the most infirm members, of which we are ashamed, we cover with all diligence; 
hands, eyes, and the whole body must help to cover and conceal them. 288] Thus 
also among ourselves should we adorn whatever blemishes and infirmities we find 
in our neighbor, and serve and help him to promote his honor to the best of our 
ability, and, on the other hand, prevent whatever may be discreditable to him. 289] 
And it is especially an excellent and noble virtue for one always to explain advanta-
geously and put the best construction upon all he may hear of his neighbor (if it be 
not notoriously evil), or at any rate to condone it over and against the poisonous 
tongues that are busy wherever they can pry out and discover something to blame 
in a neighbor, and that explain and pervert it in the worst way; as is done now 
especially with the precious Word of God and its preachers.
290] There are comprehended therefore in this commandment quite a multitude of 
good works which please God most highly, and bring abundant good and blessing, 
if only the blind world and the false saints would recognize them. For there is 
nothing on or in entire man which can do both greater and more extensive good 
or harm in spiritual and in temporal matters than the tongue, though it is the least 
and feeblest member.
The Ninth and Tenth Commandments.
292] Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house. Thou shalt not covet thy neigh-
bor’s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his cattle, nor anything 
that is his.
293] These two commandments are given quite exclusively to the Jews; never-
theless, in part they also concern us. For they do not interpret them as referring 
to unchastity or theft, because these are sufficiently forbidden above. They also 
thought that they had kept all those when they had done or not done the external 
act. Therefore God has added these two commandments in order that it be es-
The Lutheran Confessions
380
teemed as sin and forbidden to desire or in any way to aim at getting our neigh-
bor’s wife or possessions; 294] and especially because under the Jewish government 
man-servants and maid-servants were not free as now to serve for wages as long as 
they pleased, but were their master’s property with their body and all they had, as 
cattle and other possessions. 295] Moreover, every man had power over his wife to 
put her away publicly by giving her a bill of divorce, and to take another. Therefore 
they were in constant danger among each other that if one took a fancy to anoth-
er’s wife, he might allege any reason both to dismiss his own wife and to estrange 
the other’s wife from him, that he might obtain her under pretext of right. That 
was not considered a sin nor disgrace with them; as little as now with hired help, 
when a proprietor dismisses his man-servant or maid-servant, or takes another’s 
servants from him in any way.
296] Therefore (I say) they thus interpreted these commandments, and that rightly 
(although their scope reaches somewhat farther and higher), that no one think or 
purpose to obtain what belongs to another, such as his wife, servants, house and 
estate, land, meadows, cattle, even with a show of right or by a subterfuge, yet 
with injury to his neighbor. For above, in the Seventh Commandment, the vice is 
forbidden where one wrests to himself the possessions of others, or withholds them 
from his neighbor, which he cannot do by right. But here it is also forbidden to 
alienate anything from your neighbor, even though you could do so with honor in 
the eyes of the world, so that no one could accuse or blame you as though you had 
obtained it wrongfully.
297] For we are so inclined by nature that no one desires to see another have as 
much as himself, and each one acquires as much as he can; the other may fare as 
best he can. 298] And yet we pretend to be godly, know how to adorn ourselves 
most finely and conceal our rascality, resort to and invent adroit devices and 
deceitful artifices (such as now are daily most ingeniously contrived) as though 
they were derived from the law codes; yea, we even dare impertinently to refer to 
it, and boast of it, and will not have it called rascality, but shrewdness and caution. 
299] In this lawyers and jurists assist, who twist and stretch the law to suit it to 
their cause, stress words and use them for a subterfuge, irrespective of equity or 
their neighbor’s necessity. And, in short, whoever is the most expert and cunning 
in these affairs finds most help in law, as they themselves say: Vigilantibus iura 
subveniunt [that is, The laws favor the watchful].
300] This last commandment therefore is given not for rogues in the eyes of the 
world, but just for the most pious, who wish to be praised and be called honest and 
upright people, since they have not offended against the former commandments, as 
especially the Jews claimed to be, and even now many great noblemen, gentlemen, 
The Large Catechism
381
and princes. For the other common masses belong yet farther down, under the Sev-
enth Commandment, as those who are not much concerned whether they acquire 
their possessions with honor and right.
301] Now, this occurs most frequently in cases that are brought into court, where 
it is the purpose to get something from our neighbor and to force him out of his 
own. As (to give examples), when people quarrel and wrangle about a large inher-
itance, real estate, etc., they avail themselves of, and resort to, whatever has the 
appearance of right, so dressing and adorning everything that the law must favor 
their side, and they keep the property with such title that no one can make com-
plaint or lay claim thereto. 302] In like manner, if any one desire to have a castle, 
city, duchy, or any other great thing, he practises so much financiering through 
relationships, and by any means he can, that the other is judicially deprived of it, 
and it is adjudicated to him, and confirmed with deed and seal and declared to 
have been acquired by princely title and honestly.
303] Likewise also in common trade where one dexterously slips something out 
of another’s hand, so that he must look after it, or surprises and defrauds him in 
a matter in which he sees advantage and benefit for himself, so that the latter, 
perhaps on account of distress or debt, cannot regain or redeem it without injury, 
and the former gains the half or even more; and yet this must not be considered as 
acquired by fraud or stolen, but honestly bought. Here they say: First come, first 
served, and every one must look to his own interest, let another get what he can. 
304] And who can be so smart as to think of all the ways in which one can get 
many things into his possession by such specious pretexts? This the world does not 
consider wrong [nor is it punished by laws], and will not see that the neighbor is 
thereby placed at a disadvantage, and must sacrifice what he cannot spare without 
injury. Yet there is no one who wishes this to be done to him; from which we can 
easily perceive that such devices and pretexts are false.
305] Thus it was done formerly also with respect to wives: they knew such devices 
that if one were pleased with another woman, he personally or through others (as 
there were many ways and means to be invented) caused her husband to conceive 
a displeasure toward her, or had her resist him and so conduct herself that he was 
obliged to dismiss her and leave her to the other. That sort of thing undoubtedly 
prevailed much under the Law, as also we read in the Gospel of King Herod that 
he took his brother’s wife while he was yet living, and yet wished to be thought an 
honorable, pious man, as St. Mark also testifies of him. 306] But such an example, I 
trust, will not occur among us, because in the New Testament those who are mar-
ried are forbidden to be divorced, except in such a case where one [shrewdly] by 
some stratagem takes away a rich bride from another. But it is not a rare thing with 
The Lutheran Confessions
382
us that one estranges or alienates another’s man-servant or maid-servant, or entices 
them away by flattering words.
307] In whatever way such things happen, we must know that God does not wish 
that you deprive your neighbor of anything that belongs to him, so that he suffer 
the loss and you gratify your avarice with it, even if you could keep it honorably 
before the world; for it is a secret and insidious imposition practised under the hat, 
as we say, that it may not be observed. For although you go your way as if you had 
done no one any wrong, you have nevertheless injured your neighbor; and if it is 
not called stealing and cheating, yet it is called coveting your neighbor’s property, 
that is, aiming at possession of it, enticing it away from him without his will, and 
being unwilling to see him enjoy what God has granted him. 308] And although 
the judge and every one must leave you in possession of it, yet God will not leave 
you therein: for He sees the deceitful heart and the malice of the world, which is 
sure to take an ell in addition where-ever you yield to her a finger’s breadth, and at 
length public wrong and violence follow.
309] Therefore we allow these commandments to remain in their ordinary mean-
ing, that it is commanded, first, that we do not desire our neighbor’s damage, nor 
even assist, nor give occasion for it, but gladly wish and leave him what he has, and, 
besides, advance and preserve for him what may be for his profit and service, as we 
should wish to be treated. 310] Thus these commandments are especially directed 
against envy and miserable avarice, God wishing to remove all causes and sources 
whence arises everything by which we do injury to our neighbor, and therefore He 
expresses it in plain words: Thou shalt not covet, etc. For He would especially have 
the heart pure, although we shall never attain to that as long as we live here; so that 
this commandment will remain, like all the rest, one that will constantly accuse us 
and show how godly we are in the sight of God!
Conclusion of the Ten Commandments.
311] Thus we have the Ten Commandments, a compend of divine doctrine, as to 
what we are to do in order that our whole life may be pleasing to God, and the 
true fountain and channel from and in which everything must arise and flow that 
is to be a good work, so that outside of the Ten Commandments no work or thing 
can be good or pleasing to God, however great or precious it be in the eyes of the 
world. 312] Let us see now what our great saints can boast of their spiritual orders 
and their great and grievous works which they have invented and set up, while 
they let these pass, as though they were far too insignificant, or had long ago been 
perfectly fulfilled.
The Large Catechism
383
313] I am of opinion, indeed, that here one will find his hands full, [and will have 
enough] to do to observe these, namely, meekness, patience, and love towards ene-
mies, chastity, kindness, etc., and what such virtues imply. But such works are not 
of value and make no display in the eyes of the world; for they are not peculiar and 
conceited works, and restricted to particular times, places, rites, and customs, but 
are common, every-day domestic works which one neighbor can practise toward 
another; therefore they are not of high esteem.
314] But the other works cause people to open their eyes and ears wide, and men 
aid to this effect by the great display, expense, and magnificent buildings with 
which they adorn them, so that everything shines and glitters. There they waft 
incense, they sing and ring bells, they light tapers and candles, so that nothing 
else can be seen or heard. For when a priest stands there in a surplice embroidered 
with gilt, or a layman continues all day upon his knees in church, that is regarded 
as a most precious work which no one can sufficiently praise. But when a poor girl 
tends a little child and faithfully does what she is told, that is considered nothing; 
for else what should monks and nuns seek in their cloisters?
315] But see, is not that a cursed presumption of those desperate saints who dare 
to invent a higher and better life and estate than the Ten Commandments teach, 
pretending (as we have said) that this is an ordinary life for the common man, 
but that theirs is for saints and perfect ones? 316] And the miserable blind people 
do not see that no man can get so far as to keep one of the Ten Commandments 
as it should be kept, but both the Apostles’ Creed and the Lord’s Prayer must 
come to our aid (as we shall hear), by which that [power and strength to keep the 
commandments] is sought and prayed for and received continually. Therefore all 
their boasting amounts to as much as if I boasted and said: To be sure, I have not a 
penny to make payment with, but I confidently undertake to pay ten florins.
317] All this I say and urge in order that men might become rid of the sad misuse 
which has taken such deep root and still cleaves to everybody, and in all estates 
upon earth become used to looking hither only, and to being concerned about 
these matters. For it will be a long time before they will produce a doctrine or 
estates equal to the Ten Commandments, because they are so high that no one can 
attain to them by human power; and whoever does attain to them is a heavenly, 
angelic man, far above all holiness of the world. 318] Only occupy yourself with 
them, and try your best, apply all power and ability, and you will find so much to 
do that you will neither seek nor esteem any other work or holiness.
319] Let this be sufficient concerning the first part of the common Christian doc-
trine, both for teaching and urging what is necessary. In conclusion, however, we 
The Lutheran Confessions
384
must repeat the text which belongs here, of which we have treated already in the 
First Commandment, in order that we may learn what pains God requires to the 
end we may learn to inculcate and practise the Ten Commandments:
320] For I the Lord, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers 
upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Me, and 
showing mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments.
321] Although (as we have heard above) this appendix was primarily attached to 
the First Commandment, it was nevertheless [we cannot deny that it was] laid 
down for the sake of all the commandments, as all of them are to be referred and 
directed to it. Therefore I have said that this, too, should be presented to and incul-
cated upon the young, that they may learn and remember it, in order to see what is 
to urge and compel us to keep these Ten Commandments. And it is to be regarded 
as though this part were specially added to each, so that it inheres in, and pervades, 
them all.
322] Now, there is comprehended in these words (as said before) both an angry 
word of threatening and a friendly promise to terrify and warn us, and, moreover, 
to induce and encourage us to receive and highly esteem His Word as a matter 
of divine earnestness, because He Himself declares how much He is concerned 
about it, and how rigidly He will enforce it, namely, that He will horribly and 
terribly punish all who despise and transgress His commandments; 323] and again, 
how richly He will reward, bless, and do all good to those who hold them in high 
esteem, and gladly do and live according to them. Thus He demands that all our 
works proceed from a heart which fears and regards God alone, and from such fear 
avoids everything that is contrary to His will, lest it should move Him to wrath; 
and, on the other hand, also trusts in Him alone and from love to Him does all He 
wishes, because he speaks to us as friendly as a father, and offers us all grace and 
every good.
324] Just this is also the meaning and true interpretation of the first and chief 
commandment, from which all the others must flow and proceed, so that this 
word: Thou shalt have no other gods before Me, in its simplest meaning states 
nothing else than this demand: Thou shalt fear, love, and trust in Me as thine only 
true God. For where there is a heart thus disposed towards God, the same has 
fulfilled this and all the other commandments. On the other hand, whoever fears 
and loves anything else in heaven and upon earth will keep neither this nor any. 
325] Thus the entire Scriptures have everywhere preached and inculcated this com-
mandment, aiming always at these two things: fear of God and trust in Him. And 
especially the prophet David throughout the Psalms, as when he says [Ps. 147:11]: 
The Large Catechism
385
The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that hope in His mercy. 
As if the entire commandment were explained by one verse, as much as to say: The 
Lord taketh pleasure in those who have no other gods.
326] Thus the First Commandment is to shine and impart its splendor to all the 
others. Therefore you must let this declaration run through all the commandments, 
like a hoop in a wreath, joining the end to the beginning and holding them all to-
gether, that it be continually repeated and not forgotten; as, namely, in the Second 
Commandment, that we fear God and do not take His name in vain for cursing, 
lying, deceiving, and other modes of leading men astray, or rascality, but make 
proper and good use of it by calling upon Him in prayer, praise, and thanksgiving, 
derived from love and trust according to the First Commandment. In like manner 
such fear, love, and trust is to urge and force us not to despise His Word, but gladly 
to learn, hear, and esteem it holy, and honor it.
327] Thus continuing through all the following commandments towards our neigh-
bor likewise, everything is to proceed by virtue of the First Commandment, to wit, 
that we honor father and mother, masters, and all in authority, and be subject and 
obedient to them, not on their own account, but for God’s sake. For you are not to 
regard or fear father or mother, or from love of them do or omit anything. But see 
to that which God would have you do, and what He will quite surely demand of 
you; if you omit that, you have an angry Judge, but in the contrary case a gracious 
Father.
328] Again, that you do your neighbor no harm, injury, or violence, nor in any 
wise encroach upon him as touching his body, wife, property, honor, or rights, as 
all these things are commanded in their order, even though you have opportunity 
and cause to do so and no man would reprove you; but that you do good to all 
men, help them, and promote their interest, howsoever and wherever you can, 
purely from love of God and in order to please Him, in the confidence that He will 
abundantly reward you for everything. 329] Thus you see how the First Command-
ment is the chief source and fountainhead which flows into all the rest, and again, 
all return to that and depend upon it, so that beginning and end are fastened and 
bound to each other.
330] This (I say) it is profitable and necessary always to teach to the young people, 
to admonish them and to remind them of it, that they may be brought up not 
only with blows and compulsion, like cattle, but in the fear and reverence of God. 
For where this is considered and laid to heart that these things are not human 
trifles, but the commandments of the Divine Majesty, who insists upon them with 
The Lutheran Confessions
386
such earnestness, is angry with, and punishes those who despise them, and, on the 
other hand, abundantly rewards those who keep them, there will be a spontaneous 
impulse and a desire gladly to do the will of God. 331]Therefore it is not in vain 
that it is commanded in the Old Testament to write the Ten Commandments on 
all walls and corners, yes, even on the garments, not for the sake of merely having 
them written in these places and making a show of them, as did the Jews, but that 
we might have our eyes constantly fixed upon them, and have them always in our 
memory, and that we might practise them in all our actions and ways, 332] and ev-
ery one make them his daily exercise in all cases, in every business and transaction, 
as though they were written in every place wherever he would look, yea, wherever 
he walks or stands. Thus there would be occasion enough, both at home in our own 
house and abroad with our neighbors, to practise the Ten Commandments, that no 
one need run far from them.
333] From this it again appears how highly these Ten Commandments are to be 
exalted and extolled above all estates, commandments, and works which are taught 
and practised aside from them. For here we can boast and say: Let all the wise and 
saints step forth and produce, if they can, a [single] work like these command-
ments, upon which God insists with such earnestness, and which He enjoins with 
His greatest wrath and punishment, and, besides, adds such glorious promises that 
He will pour out upon us all good things and blessings. Therefore they should be 
taught above all others, and be esteemed precious and dear, as the highest treasure 
given by God.
The Apostles’ Creed
1] Thus far we have heard the first part of Christian doctrine, in which we have 
seen all that God wishes us to do or to leave undone. Now, there properly follows 
the Creed, which sets forth to us everything that we must expect and receive from 
God, and, to state it quite briefly, teaches us to know Him fully. 2] And this is 
intended to help us do that which according to the Ten Commandments we ought 
to do. For (as said above) they are set so high that all human ability is far too feeble 
and weak to [attain to or] keep them. Therefore it is as necessary to learn this 
part as the former in order that we may know how to attain thereto, whence and 
whereby to obtain such power. 3] For if we could by our own powers keep the Ten 
Commandments as they are to be kept, we would need nothing further, neither the 
Creed nor the Lord’s Prayer. 4] But before we explain this advantage and necessity 
of the Creed, it is sufficient at first for the simple-minded that they learn to com-
prehend and understand the Creed itself.
The Large Catechism
387
5] In the first place, the Creed has hitherto been divided into twelve articles, 
although, if all points which are written in the Scriptures and which belong to the 
Creed were to be distinctly set forth, there would be far more articles, nor could 
they all be clearly expressed in so few words. 6] But that it may be most easily and 
clearly understood as it is to be taught to children, we shall briefly sum up the 
entire Creed in three chief articles, according to the three persons in the Godhead, 
to whom everything that we believe is related, so that the First Article, of God the 
Father, explains Creation, the Second Article, of the Son, Redemption, and the 
Third, of the Holy Ghost, Sanctification. 7] Just as though the Creed were briefly 
comprehended in so many words: I believe in God the Father, who has created 
me; I believe in God the Son, who has redeemed me; I believe in the Holy Ghost, 
who sanctifies me. One God and one faith, but three persons, therefore also three 
articles or confessions. 8] Let us briefly run over the words.
Article I.
9] I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.
10] This portrays and sets forth most briefly what is the essence, will, activity, and 
work of God the Father. For since the Ten Commandments have taught that we are 
to have not more than one God, the question might be asked, What kind of a per-
son is God? What does He do? How can we praise, or portray and describe Him, 
that He may be known? Now, that is taught in this and in the following article, 
so that the Creed is nothing else than the answer and confession of Christians ar-
ranged with respect to the First Commandment. As if you were to ask a little child: 
11] My dear, what sort of a God have you? What do you know of Him? he could 
say: This is my God: first, the Father, who has created heaven and earth; besides this 
only One I regard nothing else as God; for there is no one else who could create 
heaven and earth.
12] But for the learned, and those who are somewhat advanced [have acquired 
some Scriptural knowledge], these three articles may all be expanded and divided 
into as many parts as there are words. But now for young scholars let it suffice to 
indicate the most necessary points, namely, as we have said, that this article refers 
to the Creation: that we emphasize the words: Creator of heaven and earth. 13] But 
what is the force of this, or what do you mean by these words: I believe in God, the 
Father Almighty, Maker, etc.? Answer: This is what I mean and believe, that I am a 
creature of God; that is, that He has given and constantly preserves to me my body, 
soul, and life, members great and small, all my senses, reason, and understanding, 
and so on, food and drink, clothing and support, wife and children, domestics, 
The Lutheran Confessions
388
house and home, etc. 14] Besides, He causes all creatures to serve for the uses and 
necessities of life sun, moon, and stars in the firmament, day and night, air, fire, 
water, earth, and whatever it bears and produces, birds and fishes beasts, grain, and 
all kinds of produce, 15]and whatever else there is of bodily and temporal goods, 
good government, peace, security. 16] Thus we learn from this article that none of 
us has of himself, nor can preserve, his life nor anything that is here enumerated or 
can be enumerated, however small and unimportant a thing it might be, for all is 
comprehended in the word Creator.
17] Moreover, we also confess that God the Father has not only given us all that we 
have and see before our eyes, but daily preserves and defends us against all evil and 
misfortune, averts all sorts of danger and calamity; and that He does all this out of 
pure love and goodness, without our merit, as a benevolent Father, who cares for us 
that no evil befall us. 18] But to speak more of this belongs in the other two parts 
of this article, where we say: Father Almighty.
19] Now, since all that we possess, and, moreover, whatever, in addition, is in heav-
en and upon the earth, is daily given, preserved, and kept for us by God, it is read-
ily inferred and concluded that it is our duty to love, praise, and thank Him for it 
without ceasing, and, in short, to serve Him with all these things, as He demands 
and has enjoined in the Ten Commandments.
20] Here we could say much if we were to expatiate, how few there are that believe 
this article. For we all pass over it, hear it and say it, but neither see nor consider 
what the words teach us. 21] For if we believed it with the heart, we would also act 
accordingly, and not stalk about proudly, act defiantly, and boast as though we had 
life, riches, power, and honor, etc., of ourselves, so that others must fear and serve 
us, as is the practise of the wretched, perverse world, which is drowned in blind-
ness, and abuses all the good things and gifts of God only for its own pride, avarice, 
lust, and luxury, and never once regards God, so as to thank Him or acknowledge 
Him as Lord and Creator.
22] Therefore, this article ought to humble and terrify us all, if we believed it. For 
we sin daily with eyes, ears, hands, body and soul, money and possessions, and with 
everything we have, especially those who even fight against the Word of God. Yet 
Christians have this advantage, that they acknowledge themselves in duty bound to 
serve God for all these things, and to be obedient to Him [which the world knows 
not how to do].
23] We ought, therefore, daily to practise this article, impress it upon our mind, 
and to remember it in all that meets our eyes, and in all good that falls to our lot, 
The Large Catechism
389
and wherever we escape from calamity or danger, that it is God who gives and does 
all these things, that therein we sense and see His Paternal heart and his transcen-
dent love toward us. Thereby the heart would be warmed and kindled to be thank-
ful, and to employ all such good things to the honor and praise of God.
24] Thus we have most briefly presented the meaning of this article, as much as is 
at first necessary for the most simple to learn, both as to what we have and receive 
from God, and what we owe in return, which is a most excellent knowledge, but 
a far greater treasure. For here we see how the Father has given Himself to us, 
together with all creatures, and has most richly provided for us in this life, besides 
that He has overwhelmed us with unspeakable, eternal treasures by His Son and 
the Holy Ghost, as we shall hear.
Article II.
25] And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy 
Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, 
and buried; He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He 
ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; 
from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.
26] Here we learn to know the Second Person of the Godhead, so that we see what 
we have from God over and above the temporal goods aforementioned; name-
ly, how He has completely poured forth Himself and withheld nothing from us 
that He has not given us. Now, this article is very rich and broad; but in order to 
expound it also briefly and in a childlike way we shall take up one word and sum 
up in that the entire article, namely (as we have said), that we may here learn how 
we have been redeemed; and we shall base this on these words: In Jesus Christ, our 
Lord.
27] If now you are asked, What do you believe in the Second Article of Jesus 
Christ? answer briefly: I believe that Jesus Christ, true Son of God, has become my 
Lord. But what is it to become Lord? It is this, that He has redeemed me from sin, 
from the devil, from death, and all evil. For before I had no Lord nor King, but was 
captive under the power of the devil, condemned to death, enmeshed in sin and 
blindness.
28] For when we had been created by God the Father, and had received from Him 
all manner of good, the devil came and led us into disobedience, sin, death, and all 
evil, so that we fell under His wrath and displeasure and were doomed to eternal 
The Lutheran Confessions
390
damnation, as we had merited and deserved. 29] There was no counsel, help, or 
comfort until this only and eternal Son of God in His unfathomable goodness had 
compassion upon our misery and wretchedness, and came from heaven to help us. 
30] Those tyrants and jailers, then, are all expelled now, and in their place has come 
Jesus Christ, Lord of life, righteousness, every blessing, and salvation, and has deliv-
ered us poor lost men from the jaws of hell, has won us, made us free, and brought 
us again into the favor and grace of the Father, and has taken us as His own prop-
erty under His shelter and protection, that He may govern us by His righteousness, 
wisdom, power, life, and blessedness.
31] Let this, then, be the sum of this article that the little word Lord signifies 
simply as much as Redeemer, i.e., He who has brought us from Satan to God, from 
death to life, from sin to righteousness, and who preserves us in the same. But all 
the points which follow in order in this article serve no other end than to explain 
and express this redemption, how and whereby it was accomplished, that is, how 
much it cost Him, and what He spent and risked that He might win us and bring 
us under His dominion, namely, that He became man, conceived and born without 
[any stain of] sin, of the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, that He might over-
come sin; moreover, that He suffered, died and was buried, that He might make 
satisfaction for me and pay what I owe, not with silver nor gold, but with His own 
precious blood. And all this, in order to become my Lord; for He did none of these 
for Himself, nor had He any need of it. And after that He rose again from the dead, 
swallowed up and devoured death, and finally ascended into heaven and assumed 
the government at the Father’s right hand, so that the devil and all powers must be 
subject to Him and lie at His feet, until finally, at the last day, He will completely 
part and separate us from the wicked world, the devil, death, sin, etc.
32] But to explain all these single points separately belongs not to brief sermons 
for children, but rather to the ampler sermons that extend throughout the entire 
year, especially at those times which are appointed for the purpose of treating at 
length of each article-of the birth, sufferings, resurrection, ascension of Christ, etc.
33] Ay, the entire Gospel which we preach is based on this, that we properly under-
stand this article as that upon which our salvation and all our happiness rest, and 
which is so rich and comprehensive that we never can learn it fully.
The Large Catechism
391
Article III.
34] I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy Christian Church, the communion of 
saints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting. 
Amen.
35] This article (as I have said) I cannot relate better than to Sanctification, that 
through the same the Holy Ghost, with His office, is declared and depicted, 
namely, that He makes holy. Therefore we must take our stand upon the word Holy 
Ghost, because it is so precise and comprehensive that we cannot find another. 36] 
For there are, besides, many kinds of spirits mentioned in the Holy Scriptures, as, 
the spirit of man, heavenly spirits, and evil spirits. But the Spirit of God alone is 
called Holy Ghost, that is, He who has sanctified and still sanctifies us. For as the 
Father is called Creator, the Son Redeemer, so the Holy Ghost, from His work, 
must be called Sanctifier, or One that makes holy. 37] But how is such sanctifying 
done? Answer: Just as the Son obtains dominion, whereby He wins us, through His 
birth, death, resurrection, etc., so also the Holy Ghost effects our sanctification by 
the following parts, namely, by the communion of saints or the Christian Church, 
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting; that 
is, He first leads us into His holy congregation, and places us in the bosom of the 
Church, whereby He preaches to us and brings us to Christ.
38] For neither you nor I could ever know anything of Christ, or believe on Him, 
and obtain Him for our Lord, unless it were offered to us and granted to our hearts 
by the Holy Ghost through the preaching of the Gospel. The work is done and ac-
complished; for Christ has acquired and gained the treasure for us by His suffering, 
death, resurrection, etc. But if the work remained concealed so that no one knew 
of it, then it would be in vain and lost. That this treasure, therefore, might not lie 
buried, but be appropriated and enjoyed, God has caused the Word to go forth and 
be proclaimed, in which He gives the Holy Ghost to bring this treasure home and 
appropriate it to us. 39] Therefore sanctifying is nothing else than bringing us to 
Christ to receive this good, to which we could not attain of ourselves.
40] Learn, then, to understand this article most clearly. If you are asked: What do 
you mean by the words: I believe in the Holy Ghost? you can answer: I believe that 
the Holy Ghost makes me holy, as His name implies. 41] But whereby does He 
accomplish this, or what are His method and means to this end? Answer: By the 
Christian Church, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life 
everlasting. 42] For, in the first place, He has a peculiar congregation in the world, 
which is the mother that begets and bears every Christian through the Word of 
God, which He reveals and preaches, [and through which] He illumines and enkin-
dles hearts, that they understand, accept it, cling to it, and persevere in it.
The Lutheran Confessions
392
43] For where He does not cause it to be preached and made alive in the heart, so 
that it is understood, it is lost, as was the case under the Papacy, where faith was 
entirely put under the bench, and no one recognized Christ as his Lord or the Holy 
Ghost as his Sanctifier, that is, no one believed that Christ is our Lord in the sense 
that He has acquired this treasure for us, without our works and merit, and made 
us acceptable to the Father. What, then, was lacking? 44] This, that the Holy Ghost 
was not there to reveal it and cause it to be preached; but men and evil spirits were 
there, who taught us to obtain grace and be saved by our works. 45] Therefore it is 
not a Christian Church either; for where Christ is not preached, there is no Holy 
Ghost who creates, calls, and gathers the Christian Church, without which no one 
can come to Christ the Lord. 46] Let this suffice concerning the sum of this article. 
But because the parts which are here enumerated are not quite clear to the simple, 
we shall run over them also.
47] The Creed denominates the holy Christian Church, communionem sanctorum, 
a communion of saints; for both expressions, taken together, are identical. But 
formerly the one [the second] expression was not there, and it has been poorly and 
unintelligibly translated into German eine Gemeinschaft der Heiligen, a commu-
nion of saints. If it is to be rendered plainly, it must be expressed quite differently 
in the German idiom; for the word ecclesia properly means in German eine Ver-
sammlung, an assembly. 48] But we are accustomed to the word church, by which 
the simple do not understand an assembled multitude, but the consecrated house 
or building, although the house ought not to be called a church, except only for the 
reason that the multitude assembles there. For we who assemble there make and 
choose for ourselves a particular place, and give a name to the house according to 
the assembly.
Thus the word Kirche (church) means really nothing else than a common assembly, 
and is not German by idiom, but Greek (as is also the word ecclesia); for in their 
own language they call it kyria, as in Latin it is called curia. Therefore in genuine 
German, in our mother-tongue, it ought to be called a Christian congregation 
or assembly (eine christliche Gemeinde oder Sammlung), or, best of all and most 
clearly, holy Christendom (eine heilige Christenheit).
49] So also the word communio, which is added, ought not to be rendered com-
munion (Gemeinschaft), but congregation (Gemeinde). And it is nothing else than 
an interpretation or explanation by which some one meant to explain what the 
Christian Church is. This our people, who understood neither Latin nor German, 
have rendered Gemeinschaft der Heiligen (communion of saints), although no 
German language speaks thus, nor understands it thus. But to speak correct Ger-
man, it ought to be eine Gemeinde der Heiligen (a congregation of saints), that is, 
a congregation made up purely of saints, or, to speak yet more plainly, eine heilige 
The Large Catechism
393
Gemeinde, a holy congregation. 50] I say this in order that the words Gemeinschaft 
der Heiligen (communion of saints) may be understood, because the expression has 
become so established by custom that it cannot well be eradicated, and it is treated 
almost as heresy if one should attempt to change a word.
51] But this is the meaning and substance of this addition: I believe that there is 
upon earth a little holy group and congregation of pure saints, under one head, 
even Christ, called together by the Holy Ghost in one faith, one mind, and under-
standing, with manifold gifts, yet agreeing in love, without sects or schisms. 52] I 
am also a part and member of the same, a sharer and joint owner of all the goods 
it possesses, brought to it and incorporated into it by the Holy Ghost by having 
heard and continuing to hear the Word of God, which is the beginning of entering 
it. For formerly, before we had attained to this, we were altogether of the devil, 
knowing nothing of God and of Christ. 53] Thus, until the last day, the Holy Ghost 
abides with the holy congregation or Christendom, by means of which He fetches 
us to Christ and which He employs to teach and preach to us the Word, whereby 
He works and promotes sanctification, causing it [this community] daily to grow 
and become strong in the faith and its fruits which He produces.
54] We further believe that in this Christian Church we have forgiveness of sin, 
which is wrought through the holy Sacraments and Absolution, moreover, through 
all manner of consolatory promises of the entire Gospel. Therefore, whatever is 
to be preached concerning the Sacraments belongs here, and, in short, the whole 
Gospel and all the offices of Christianity, which also must be preached and taught 
without ceasing. For although the grace of God is secured through Christ, and 
sanctification is wrought by the Holy Ghost through the Word of God in the unity 
of the Christian Church, yet on account of our flesh which we bear about with us 
we are never without sin.
55] Everything, therefore, in the Christian Church is ordered to the end that we 
shall daily obtain there nothing but the forgiveness of sin through the Word and 
signs, to comfort and encourage our consciences as long as we live here. Thus, 
although we have sins, the [grace of the] Holy Ghost does not allow them to injure 
us, because we are in the Christian Church, where there is nothing but [continu-
ous, uninterrupted] forgiveness of sin, both in that God forgives us, and in that we 
forgive, bear with, and help each other.
56] But outside of this Christian Church, where the Gospel is not, there is no 
forgiveness, as also there can be no holiness [sanctification]. Therefore all who seek 
and wish to merit holiness [sanctification], not through the Gospel and forgive-
ness of sin, but by their works, have expelled and severed themselves [from this 
Church].
The Lutheran Confessions
394
57] Meanwhile, however, while sanctification has begun and is growing daily, we 
expect that our flesh will be destroyed and buried with all its uncleanness, and will 
come forth gloriously, and arise to entire and perfect holiness in a new eternal life. 
58] For now we are only half pure and holy, so that the Holy Ghost has ever [some 
reason why] to continue His work in us through the Word, and daily to dispense 
forgiveness, until we attain to that life where there will be no more forgiveness, but 
only perfectly pure and holy people, full of godliness and righteousness, removed 
and free from sin, death, and all evil, in a new, immortal, and glorified body.
59] Behold, all this is to be the office and work of the Holy Ghost, that He begin 
and daily increase holiness upon earth by means of these two things, the Christian 
Church and the forgiveness of sin. But in our dissolution He will accomplish it 
altogether in an instant, and will forever preserve us therein by the last two parts.
60] But the term Auferstehung des Fleisches (resurrection of the flesh) here em-
ployed is not according to good German idiom. For when we Germans hear the 
word Fleisch (flesh), we think no farther than of the shambles. But in good German 
idiom we would say Auferstehung des Leibes, or Leichnams (resurrection of the 
body). However, it is not a matter of much moment, if we only understand the 
words aright.
61] This, now, is the article which must ever be and remain in operation. For cre-
ation we have received; redemption, too, is finished But the Holy Ghost carries on 
His work without ceasing to the last day. And for that purpose He has appointed 
a congregation upon earth by which He speaks and does everything. 62] For He 
has not yet brought together all His Christian Church nor dispensed forgiveness. 
Therefore we believe in Him who through the Word daily brings us into the fellow-
ship of this Christian Church, and through the same Word and the forgiveness of 
sins bestows, increases, and strengthens faith, in order that when He has accom-
plished it all, and we abide therein, and die to the world and to all evil, He may 
finally make us perfectly and forever holy; which now we expect in faith through 
the Word.
63] Behold, here you have the entire divine essence, will, and work depicted most 
exquisitely in quite short and yet rich words, wherein consists all our wisdom, 
which surpasses and exceeds the wisdom, mind, and reason of all men. For 
although the whole world with all diligence has endeavored to ascertain what 
God is, what He has in mind and does, yet has she never been able to attain to 
[the knowledge and understanding of] any of these things. 64] But here we have 
everything in richest measure; for here in all three articles He has Himself revealed 
and opened the deepest abyss of his paternal heart and of His pure unutterable 
love. For He has created us for this very object, that He might redeem and sanctify 
The Large Catechism
395
us; and in addition to giving and imparting to us everything in heaven and upon 
earth, He has given to us even His Son and the Holy Ghost, by whom to bring us 
to Himself. 65] For (as explained above) we could never attain to the knowledge of 
the grace and favor of the Father except through the Lord Christ, who is a mirror 
of the paternal heart, outside of whom we see nothing but an angry and terrible 
Judge. But of Christ we could know nothing either, unless it had been revealed by 
the Holy Ghost.
66] These articles of the Creed, therefore, divide and separate us Christians from 
all other people upon earth. For all outside of Christianity, whether heathen, 
Turks, Jews, or false Christians and hypocrites, although they believe in, and wor-
ship, only one true God, yet know not what His mind towards them is, and cannot 
expect any love or blessing from Him; therefore they abide in eternal wrath and 
damnation. For they have not the Lord Christ, and, besides, are not illumined and 
favored by any gifts of the Holy Ghost.
67] From this you perceive that the Creed is a doctrine quite different from the 
Ten Commandments; for the latter teaches indeed what we ought to do, but the 
former tells what God does for us and gives to us. Moreover, apart from this, the 
Ten Commandments are written in the hearts of all men; the Creed, however, no 
human wisdom can comprehend, but it must be taught by the Holy Ghost alone. 
68] The latter doctrine [of the Law], therefore, makes no Christian, for the wrath 
and displeasure of God abide upon us still, because we cannot keep what God de-
mands of us; but this [namely, the doctrine of faith] brings pure grace, and makes 
us godly and acceptable to God. 69] For by this knowledge we obtain love and de-
light in all the commandments of God, because here we see that God gives Himself 
entire to us, with all that He has and is able to do, to aid and direct us in keeping 
the Ten Commandments-the Father, all creatures; the Son, His entire work; and 
the Holy Ghost, all His gifts.
70] Let this suffice concerning the Creed to lay a foundation for the simple, that 
they may not be burdened, so that, if they understand the substance of it, they 
themselves may afterwards strive to acquire more, and to refer to these parts 
whatever they learn in the Scriptures, and may ever grow and increase in richer un-
derstanding. For as long as we live here, we shall daily have enough to do to preach 
and to learn this.
The Lutheran Confessions

The Lord’s Prayer
1] We have now heard what we must do and believe, in which things the best and 
happiest life consists. Now follows the third part, how we ought to pray. 2] For 
since we are so situated that no man can perfectly keep the Ten Commandments, 
even though he have begun to believe, and since the devil with all his power, 
together with the world and our own flesh, resists our endeavors, nothing is so 
necessary as that we should continually resort to the ear of God, call upon Him, 
and pray to Him, that He would give, preserve, and increase in us faith and the 
fulfilment of the Ten Commandments, and that He would remove everything that 
is in our way and opposes us therein. 3] But that we might know what and how to 
pray, our Lord Christ has Himself taught us both the mode and the words, as we 
shall see.
4] But before we explain the Lord’s Prayer part by part, it is most necessary first 
to exhort and incite people to prayer, as Christ and the apostles also have done. 5] 
And the first matter is to know that it is our duty to pray because of God’s com-
mandment. For thus we heard in the Second Commandment: Thou shalt not take 
the name of the Lord, thy God, in vain, that we are there required to praise that 
holy name, and call upon it in every need, or to pray. For to call upon the name 
of God is nothing else than to pray. 6] Prayer is therefore as strictly and earnestly 
commanded as all other commandments: to have no other God, not to kill, not to 
steal, etc. Let no one think that it is all the same whether he pray or not, as vulgar 
people do, who grope in such delusion and ask, Why should I pray? Who knows 
whether God heeds or will hear my prayer? If I do not pray, some one else will. 
And thus they fall into the habit of never praying, and frame a pretext, as though 
we taught that there is no duty or need of prayer, because we reject false and hypo-
critical prayers.
7] But this is true indeed that such prayers as have been offered hitherto when men 
were babbling and bawling in the churches were no prayers. For such external mat-
ters, when they are properly observed, may be a good exercise for young children, 
scholars, and simple persons, and may be called singing or reading, but not really 
praying. 8] But praying, as the Second Commandment teaches, is to call upon 
God in every need. This He requires of us, and has not left it to our choice. But it 
is our duty and obligation to pray if we would be Christians, as much as it is our 
duty and obligation to obey our parents and the government; for by calling upon 
it and praying the name of God is honored and profitably employed. 9] This you 
must note above all things, that thereby you may silence and repel such thoughts as 
would keep and deter us from prayer. For just as it would be idle for a son to say to 
his father, “Of what advantage is my obedience? I will go and do what I can; it is all 
The Large Catechism
397
the same;” but there stands the commandment, Thou shalt and must do it, so also 
here it is not left to my will to do it or leave it undone, but prayer shall and must 
be offered at the risk of God’s wrath and displeasure.
10] This is therefore to be understood and noted before everything else, in order 
that thereby we may silence and repel the thoughts which would keep and deter 
us from praying, as though it were not of much consequence if we do not pray, or 
as though it were commanded those who are holier and in better favor with God 
than we; as, indeed, the human heart is by nature so despondent that it always 
flees from God and imagines that He does not wish or desire our prayer, because 
we are sinners and have merited nothing but wrath. 11] Against such thoughts (I 
say) we should regard this commandment and turn to God, that we may not by 
such disobedience excite His anger still more. For by this commandment He gives 
us plainly to understand that He will not cast us from Him nor chase us away, 
although we are sinners, but rather draw us to Himself, so that we might humble 
ourselves before Him, bewail this misery and plight of ours, and pray for grace 
and help. Therefore we read in the Scriptures that He is angry also with those who 
were smitten for their sin, because they did not return to Him and by their prayers 
assuage His wrath and seek His grace.
12] Now, from the fact that it is so solemnly commanded to pray, you are to con-
clude and think, that no one should by any means despise his prayer, but rather 
set great store by it, 13] and always seek an illustration from the other command-
ments. A child should by no means despise his obedience to father and mother, but 
should always think: This work is a work of obedience, and what I do I do with no 
other intention than that I may walk in the obedience and commandment of God, 
on which I can settle and stand firm, and esteem it a great thing, not on account 
of my worthiness, but on account of the commandment. So here also, what and 
for what we pray we should regard as demanded by God and done in obedience 
to Him, and should reflect thus: On my account it would amount to nothing; but 
it shall avail, for the reason that God has commanded it. Therefore everybody, no 
matter what he has to say in prayer, should always come before God in obedience 
to this commandment.
14] We pray, therefore, and exhort every one most diligently to take this to heart 
and by no means to despise our prayer. For hitherto it has been taught thus in the 
devil’s name that no one regarded these things, and men supposed it to be suffi-
cient to have done the work, whether God would hear it or not. But that is staking 
prayer on a risk, and murmuring it at a venture; and therefore it is a lost prayer. 
15] For we allow such thoughts as these to lead us astray and deter us: I am not 
holy or worthy enough; if I were as godly and holy as St. Peter or St. Paul, then 
The Lutheran Confessions
398
I would pray. But put such thoughts far away, for just the same commandment 
which applied to St. Paul applies also to me; and the Second Commandment is 
given as much on my account as on his account, so that he can boast of no better 
or holier commandment.
16] Therefore you should say: My prayer is as precious, holy, and pleasing to God as 
that of St. Paul or of the most holy saints. This is the reason: For I will gladly grant 
that he is holier in his person, but not on account of the commandment; since 
God does not regard prayer on account of the person, but on account of His word 
and obedience thereto. For on the commandment on which all the saints rest their 
prayer I, too, rest mine. Moreover, I pray for the same thing for which they all pray 
and ever have prayed; besides, I have just as great a need of it as those great saints, 
yea, even a greater one than they.
17] Let this be the first and most important point, that all our prayers must be 
based and rest upon obedience to God, irrespective of our person, whether we be 
sinners or saints, worthy or unworthy. 18] And we must know that God will not 
have it treated as a jest, but be angry, and punish all who do not pray, as surely as 
He punishes all other disobedience; next, that He will not suffer our prayers to be 
in vain or lost. For if He did not intend to answer your prayer, He would not bid 
you pray and add such a severe commandment to it.
19] In the second place, we should be the more urged and incited to pray because 
God has also added a promise, and declared that it shall surely be done to us as we 
pray, as He says Ps. 50:15: Call upon Me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee. 
And Christ in the Gospel of St. Matthew 7:7: Ask, and it shall be given you. For 
every one that asketh receiveth. 20] Such promises ought certainly to encourage 
and kindle our hearts to pray with pleasure and delight, since He testifies with 
His [own] word that our prayer is heartily pleasing to Him, moreover, that it shall 
assuredly be heard and granted, in order that we may not despise it or think lightly 
of it, and pray at a venture.
21] This you can hold up to Him and say: Here I come, dear Father, and pray, not 
of my own purpose nor upon my own worthiness, but at Thy commandment and 
promise, which cannot fail or deceive me. Whoever, therefore, does not believe this 
promise must know again that he excites God to anger as a person who most highly 
dishonors Him and reproaches Him with falsehood.
22] Besides this, we should be incited and drawn to prayer because in addition 
to this commandment and promise God anticipates us, and Himself arranges the 
words and form of prayer for us, and places them upon our lips as to how and what 
The Large Catechism
399
we should pray, that we may see how heartily He pities us in our distress, and may 
never doubt that such prayer is pleasing to Him and shall certainly be answered; 
which [the Lord’s Prayer] is a great advantage indeed over all other prayers that we 
might compose ourselves. 23] For in them the conscience would ever be in doubt 
and say: I have prayed, but who knows how it pleases Him, or whether I have hit 
upon the right proportions and form? Hence there is no nobler prayer to be found 
upon earth than the Lord’s Prayer which we daily pray, because it has this excellent 
testimony, that God loves to hear it, which we ought not to surrender for all the 
riches of the world.
24] And it has been prescribed also for this reason that we should see and consider 
the distress which ought to urge and compel us to pray without ceasing. For whoev-
er would pray must have something to present, state, and name which he desires; if 
not, it cannot be called a prayer.
25] Therefore we have rightly rejected the prayers of monks and priests, who howl 
and growl day and night like fiends; but none of them think of praying for a hair’s 
breadth of anything. And if we would assemble all the churches, together with all 
ecclesiastics, they would be obliged to confess that they have never from the heart 
prayed for even a drop of wine. For none of them has ever purposed to pray from 
obedience to God and faith in His promise, nor has any one regarded any distress, 
but (when they had done their best) they thought no further than this, to do a 
good work, whereby they might repay God, as being unwilling to take anything 
from Him, but wishing only to give Him something.
26] But where there is to be a true prayer, there must be earnestness. Men must 
feel their distress, and such distress as presses them and compels them to call and 
cry out; then prayer will be made spontaneously, as it ought to be, and men will 
require no teaching how to prepare for it and to attain to the proper devotion. 27] 
But the distress which ought to concern us most, both as regards ourselves and 
every one, you will find abundantly set forth in the Lord’s Prayer. Therefore it is 
to serve also to remind us of the same, that we contemplate it and lay it to heart, 
lest we become remiss in prayer. For we all have enough that we lack, but the great 
want is that we do not feel nor see it. Therefore God also requires that you lament 
and plead such necessities and wants, not because He does not know them, but 
that you may kindle your heart to stronger and greater desires, and make wide and 
open your cloak to receive much.
28] Therefore, every one of us should accustom himself from his youth daily to 
pray for all his wants, whenever he is sensible of anything affecting his interests or 
that of other people among whom he may live, as for preachers, the government, 
The Lutheran Confessions
400
neighbors, domestics, and always (as we have said) to hold up to God His com-
mandment and promise, knowing that He will not have them disregarded. 29] This 
I say because I would like to see these things brought home again to the people that 
they might learn to pray truly, and not go about coldly and indifferently, whereby 
they become daily more unfit for prayer; which is just what the devil desires, and 
for what he works with all his powers. For he is well aware what damage and harm 
it does him when prayer is in proper practise.
30] For this we must know, that all our shelter and protection rest in prayer alone. 
For we are far too feeble to cope with the devil and all his power and adherents 
that set themselves against us, and they might easily crush us under their feet. 
Therefore we must consider and take up those weapons with which 31] Christians 
must be armed in order to stand against the devil. For what do you think has hith-
erto accomplished such great things, has checked or quelled the counsels, purposes, 
murder, and riot of our enemies, whereby the devil thought to crush us, together 
with the Gospel, except that the prayer of a few godly men intervened like a wall 
of iron on our side? They should else have witnessed a far different tragedy, namely, 
how the devil would have destroyed all Germany in its own blood. But now they 
may confidently deride it and make a mock of it; however, we shall nevertheless 
be a match both for themselves and the devil by prayer alone, if we only persevere 
diligently and not become slack. 32] For whenever a godly Christian prays: Dear 
Father, let Thy will be done, God speaks from on high and says: Yes, dear child, it 
shall be so, in spite of the devil and all the world.
33] Let this be said as an exhortation, that men may learn, first of all, to esteem 
prayer as something great and precious, and to make a proper distinction between 
babbling and praying for something. For we by no means reject prayer, but the 
bare, useless howling and murmuring we reject, as Christ Himself also rejects and 
prohibits long palavers. 34] Now we shall most briefly and clearly treat of the 
Lord’s Prayer. Here there is comprehended in seven successive articles, or petitions, 
every need which never ceases to relate to us, and each so great that it ought to 
constrain us to keep praying it all our lives.
The First Petition.
35] Hallowed be Thy name.
36] This is, indeed, somewhat obscure, and not expressed in good German, for 
in our mother-tongue we would say: Heavenly Father, help that by all means Thy 
name may be holy. 37] But what is it to pray that His name may be holy? Is it not 
The Large Catechism
401
holy already? Answer: Yes, it is always holy in its nature, but in our use it is not 
holy. For God’s name was given us when we became Christians and were baptized, 
so that we are called children of God and have the Sacraments, by which He so 
incorporates us in Himself that everything which is God’s must serve for our use.
38] Here now the great need exists for which we ought to be most concerned, that 
this name have its proper honor, be esteemed holy and sublime as the greatest trea-
sure and sanctuary that we have; and that as godly children we pray that the name 
of God, which is already holy in heaven, may also be and remain holy with us upon 
earth and in all the world.
39] But how does it become holy among us? Answer, as plainly as it can be said: 
When both our doctrine and life are godly and Christian. For since in this prayer 
we call God our Father, it is our duty always to deport and demean ourselves as 
godly children, that He may not receive shame, but honor and praise from us.
40] Now the name of God is profaned by us either in words or in works. (For what-
ever we do upon the earth must be either words or works, speech or act.) 41] In 
the first place, then, it is profaned when men preach, teach, and speak in the name 
of God what is false and misleading, so that His name must serve to adorn and to 
find a market for falsehood. That is, indeed, the greatest profanation and dishonor 
of the divine name. Furthermore, also when men, by swearing, cursing, conjuring, 
etc., grossly abuse the holy name as a cloak for their shame. In the second place, 
also by an openly wicked life and works, when those who are called Christians and 
the people of God are adulterers, drunkards, misers, envious, and slanderers. 42] 
Here again must the name of God come to shame and be profaned because of us. 
43] For just as it is a shame and disgrace to a natural father to have a bad, perverse 
child that opposes him in words and deeds, so that on its account he suffers con-
tempt and reproach, 44] so also it brings dishonor upon God if we who are called 
by His name and have all manner of goods from Him teach, speak, and live in any 
other manner except as godly and heavenly children, so that people say of us that 
we must be not God’s, but the devil’s children.
45] Thus you see that in this petition we pray just for that which God demands 
in the Second Commandment; namely, that His name be not taken in vain to 
swear, curse, lie, deceive, etc., but be usefully employed to the praise and honor of 
God. For whoever employs the name of God for any sort of wrong profanes and 
desecrates this holy name, as aforetime a church was considered desecrated when 
a murder or any other crime had been committed in it, or when a pyx or relic was 
desecrated, as being holy in themselves, yet become unholy in use. 46]Thus this 
The Lutheran Confessions
402
point is easy and clear if only the language is understood, that to hallow is the same 
as in our idiom to praise, magnify, and honor both in word and deed.
47] Here, now, learn how great need there is of such prayer. For because we see 
how full the world is of sects and false teachers, who all wear the holy name as a 
cover and sham for their doctrines of devils, we ought by all means to pray without 
ceasing, and to cry and call upon God against all such as preach and believe falsely 
and whatever opposes and persecutes our Gospel and pure doctrine, and would 
suppress it, as bishops, tyrants, enthusiasts, etc. Likewise also for ourselves who 
have the Word of God, but are not thankful for it, nor live as we ought according 
to the same. 48] If now you pray for this with your heart, you can be sure that it 
pleases God; for He will not hear anything more dear to Him than that His honor 
and praise is exalted above everything else, and His Word is taught in its purity 
and is esteemed precious and dear.
The Second Petition.
Thy kingdom come.
49] As we prayed in the First Petition concerning the honor and name of God 
that He would prevent the world from adorning its lies and wickedness with it, 
but cause it to be esteemed sublime and holy both in doctrine and life, so that He 
may be praised and magnified in us, so here we pray that His kingdom also may 
come. 50] But just as the name of God is in itself holy, and we pray nevertheless 
that it be holy among us, so also His kingdom comes of itself, without our prayer, 
yet we pray nevertheless that it may come to us, that is, prevail among us and with 
us, so that we may be a part of those among whom His name is hallowed and His 
kingdom prospers.
51] But what is the kingdom of God? Answer: Nothing else than what we learned 
in the Creed, that God sent His Son Jesus Christ, our Lord, into the world to 
redeem and deliver us from the power of the devil, and to bring us to Himself, and 
to govern us as a King of righteousness, life, and salvation against sin, death, and 
an evil conscience, for which end He has also bestowed His Holy Ghost, who is to 
bring these things home to us by His holy Word, and to illumine and strengthen us 
in the faith by His power.
52] Therefore we pray here in the first place that this may become effective with us, 
and that His name be so praised through the holy Word of God and a Christian life 
The Large Catechism
403
that both we who have accepted it may abide and daily grow therein, and that it 
may gain approbation and adherence among other people and proceed with power 
throughout the world, that many may find entrance into the Kingdom of Grace, be 
made partakers of redemption, being led thereto by the Holy Ghost, in order that 
thus we may all together remain forever in the one kingdom now begun.
53] For the coming of God’s Kingdom to us occurs in two ways; first, here in time 
through the Word and faith; and secondly, in eternity forever through revelation. 
Now we pray for both these things, that it may come to those who are not yet in it, 
and, by daily increase, to us who have received the same, and hereafter in eternal 
life. 54] All this is nothing else than saying: Dear Father, we pray, give us first Thy 
Word, that the Gospel be preached properly throughout the world; and secondly, 
that it be received in faith, and work and live in us, so that through the Word and 
the power of the Holy Ghost Thy kingdom may prevail among us, and the kingdom 
of the devil be put down, that he may have no right or power over us, until at last 
it shall be utterly destroyed, and sin, death, and hell shall be exterminated, that we 
may live forever in perfect righteousness and blessedness.
55] From this you perceive that we pray here not for a crust of bread or a temporal, 
perishable good, but for an eternal inestimable treasure and everything that God 
Himself possesses; which is far too great for any human heart to think of desiring 
if He had not Himself commanded us to pray for the same. 56] But because He is 
God, He also claims the honor of giving much more and more abundantly than any 
one can comprehend,-like an eternal, unfailing fountain, which, the more it pours 
forth and overflows, the more it continues to give,-and He desires nothing more 
earnestly of us than that we ask much and great things of Him, and again is angry 
if we do not ask and pray confidently.
57] For just as when the richest and most mighty emperor would bid a poor beggar 
ask whatever he might desire, and were ready to give great imperial presents, and 
the fool would beg only for a dish of gruel, he would be rightly considered a rogue 
and a scoundrel, who treated the command of his imperial majesty as a jest and 
sport, and was not worthy of coming into his presence: so also it is a great reproach 
and dishonor to God if we, to whom He offers and pledges so many unspeakable 
treasures, despise the same, or have not the confidence to receive them, but scarce-
ly venture to pray for a piece of bread.
58] All this is the fault of the shameful unbelief which does not look to God for 
as much good as will satisfy the stomach, much less expects without doubt such 
eternal treasures of God. Therefore we must strengthen ourselves against it, and let 
this be our first prayer; then, indeed, we shall have all else in abundance, as Christ 
The Lutheran Confessions
404
teaches [Matt. 6:33]: Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and 
all these things shall be added unto you. For how could He allow us to suffer want 
and to be straitened in temporal things when He promises that which is eternal 
and imperishable?
The Third Petition.
59] Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
60] Thus far we have prayed that God’s name be honored by us, and that His 
kingdom prevail among us; in which two points is comprehended all that pertains 
to the honor of God and to our salvation, that we receive as our own God and all 
His riches. But now a need just as great arises, namely, that we firmly keep them, 
and do not suffer ourselves to be torn therefrom. 61] For as in a good government 
it is not only necessary that there be those who build and govern well, but also 
those who make defense, afford protection and maintain it firmly, so here likewise, 
although we have prayed for the greatest need, for the Gospel, faith, and the Holy 
Ghost, that He may govern us and redeem us from the power of the devil, we must 
also pray that His will be done. For there will be happenings quite strange if we are 
to abide therein, as we shall have to suffer many thrusts and blows on that account 
from everything that ventures to oppose and prevent the fulfilment of the two 
petitions that precede.
62] For no one believes how the devil opposes and resists them, and cannot suffer 
that any one teach or believe aright. And it hurts him beyond measure to suffer his 
lies and abominations, that have been honored under the most specious pretexts of 
the divine name, to be exposed, and to be disgraced himself, and, besides, be driven 
out of the heart, and suffer such a breach to be made in his kingdom. Therefore 
he chafes and rages as a fierce enemy with all his power and might, and marshals 
all his subjects, and, in addition, enlists the world and our own flesh as his allies. 
63] For our flesh is in itself indolent and inclined to evil, even though we have ac-
cepted and believe the Word of God. The world, however, is perverse and wicked; 
this he incites against us, fans and stirs the fire, that he may hinder and drive us 
back, cause us to fall, and again bring us under his power. 64] Such is all his will, 
mind, and thought, for which he strives day and night, and never rests a moment, 
employing all arts, wiles, ways, and means whichever he can invent.
65] If we would be Christians, therefore, we must surely expect and reckon upon 
having the devil with all his angels and the world as our enemies who will bring ev-
ery possible misfortune and grief upon us. For where the Word of God is preached, 
The Large Catechism
405
accepted, or believed, and produces fruit, there the holy cross cannot be wanting. 
And let no one think that he shall have peace; but he must risk whatever he has 
upon earth-possessions, honor, house and estate, wife and children, body and life. 
66] Now, this hurts our flesh and the old Adam; for the test is to be steadfast and 
to suffer with patience in whatever way we are assailed, and to let go whatever is 
taken from us.
67] Hence there is just as great need, as in all the others, that we pray without ceas-
ing: “Dear Father, Thy will be done, not the will of the devil and of our enemies, 
nor of anything that would persecute and suppress Thy holy Word or hinder Thy 
kingdom; and grant that we may bear with patience and overcome whatever is to 
be endured on that account, lest our poor flesh yield or fall away from weakness or 
sluggishness.”
68] Behold, thus we have in these three petitions, in the simplest manner, the need 
which relates to God Himself, yet all for our sakes. For whatever we pray concerns 
only us, namely, as we have said, that what must be done anyway without us, may 
also be done in us. For as His name must be hallowed and His kingdom come with-
out our prayer, so also His will must be done and succeed, although the devil with 
all his adherents raise a great tumult, are angry and rage against it, and undertake 
to exterminate the Gospel utterly. But for our own sakes we must pray that even 
against their fury His will be done without hindrance also among us, that they may 
not be able to accomplish anything and we remain firm against all violence and 
persecution, and submit to such will of God.
69] Such prayer, then, is to be our protection and defense now, is to repel and put 
down all that the devil, Pope, bishops, tyrants, and heretics can do against our 
Gospel. Let them all rage and attempt their utmost, and deliberate and resolve how 
they may suppress and exterminate us, that their will and counsel may prevail: over 
and against this one or two Christians with this petition alone shall be our wall 
against which they shall run and dash themselves to pieces. 70]This consolation and 
confidence we have, that the will and purpose of the devil and of all our enemies 
shall and must fail and come to naught, however proud, secure, and powerful they 
know themselves to be. For if their will were not broken and hindered, the king-
dom of God could not abide on earth nor His name be hallowed.
The Fourth Petition.
71] Give us this day our daily bread.
The Lutheran Confessions
406
72] Here, now, we consider the poor bread basket, the necessaries of our body and 
of the temporal life. It is a brief and simple word, but it has a very wide scope. 
For when you mention and pray for daily bread, you pray for everything that is 
necessary in order to have and enjoy daily bread and, on the other hand, against 
everything which interferes with it. Therefore you must open wide and extend 
your thoughts not only to the oven or the flour-bin, but to the distant field and the 
entire land, which bears and brings to us daily bread and every sort of sustenance. 
For if God did not cause it to grow, and bless and preserve it in the field, we could 
never take bread from the oven or have any to set upon the table.
73] To comprise it briefly, this petition includes everything that belongs to our 
entire life in the world, because on that account alone do we need daily bread. 
Now for our life it is not only necessary that our body have food and covering and 
other necessaries, but also that we spend our days in peace and quiet among the 
people with whom we live and have intercourse in daily business and conversation 
and all sorts of doings, in short, whatever pertains both to the domestic and to 
the neighborly or civil relation and government. For where these two things are 
hindered [intercepted and disturbed] that they do not prosper as they ought, the 
necessaries of life also are impeded, so that ultimately life cannot be maintained. 
74] And there is, indeed, the greatest need to pray for temporal authority and 
government, as that by which most of all God preserves to us our daily bread and 
all the comforts of this life. For though we have received of God all good things 
in abundance, we are not able to retain any of them or use them in security and 
happiness, if He did not give us a permanent and peaceful government. For where 
there are dissension, strife, and war, there the daily bread is already taken away, or 
at least checked.
75] Therefore it would be very proper to place in the coat-of-arms of every pious 
prince a loaf of bread instead of a lion, or a wreath of rue, or to stamp it upon the 
coin, to remind both them and their subjects that by their office we have protec-
tion and peace, and that without them we could not eat and retain our daily bread. 
Therefore they are also worthy of all honor, that we give to them for their office 
what we ought and can, as to those through whom we enjoy in peace and quiet-
ness what we have, because otherwise we would not keep a farthing; and that, in 
addition, we also pray for them that through them God may bestow on us the more 
blessing and good.
76] Let this be a very brief explanation and sketch, showing how far this petition 
extends through all conditions on earth. Of this any one might indeed make a long 
prayer, and with many words enumerate all the things that are included therein, as 
that we pray God to give us food and drink, clothing, house, and home, and health 
The Large Catechism
407
of body; also that He cause the grain and fruits of the field to grow and mature well; 
furthermore, that He help us at home towards good housekeeping, that He give and 
preserve to us a godly wife, children, and servants, that He cause our work, trade, or 
whatever we are engaged in to prosper and succeed, favor us with faithful neighbors 
and good friends, etc. 77] Likewise, that He give to emperors, kings, and all estates, 
and especially to the rulers of our country and to all counselors, magistrates, and 
officers, wisdom, strength, and success that they may govern well and vanquish the 
Turks and all enemies; to subjects and the common people, obedience, peace, and 
harmony in their life with one another; 78] and on the other hand, that He would 
preserve us from all sorts of calamity to body and livelihood, as lightning, hail, fire, 
flood, poison, pestilence, cattle-plague, war and bloodshed, famine, destructive 
beasts, wicked men, etc. 79] All this it is well to impress upon the simple, namely, 
that these things come from God, and must be prayed for by us.
80] But this petition is especially directed also against our chief enemy, the devil. 
For all his thought and desire is to deprive us of all that we have from God, or to 
hinder it; and he is not satisfied to obstruct and destroy spiritual government in 
leading souls astray by his lies and bringing them under his power, but he also 
prevents and hinders the stability of all government and honorable, peaceable rela-
tions on earth. There he causes so much contention, murder, sedition, and war, also 
lightning and hail to destroy grain and cattle, to poison the air, etc. 81]In short, 
he is sorry that any one has a morsel of bread from God and eats it in peace; and if 
it were in his power, and our prayer (next to God) did not prevent him, we would 
not keep a straw in the field, a farthing in the house, yea, not even our life for an 
hour, especially those who have the Word of God and would like to be Christians.
82] Behold, thus God wishes to indicate to us how He cares for us in all our need, 
and faithfully provides also for our temporal support. 83] And although He 
abundantly grants and preserves these things even to the wicked and knaves, yet 
He wishes that we pray for them, in order that we may recognize that we receive 
them from His hand, and may feel His paternal goodness toward us therein. For 
when He withdraws His hand, nothing can prosper nor be maintained in the end, 
as, indeed, we daily see and experience. 84] How much trouble there is now in the 
world only on account of bad coin, yea, on account of daily oppression and raising 
of prices in common trade, bargaining and labor on the part of those who wan-
tonly oppress the poor and deprive them of their daily bread! This we must suffer 
indeed; but let them take care that they do not lose the common intercession, and 
beware lest this petition in the Lord’s Prayer be against them.

The Fifth Petition.
85] And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.
86] This part now relates to our poor miserable life, which, although we have and 
believe the Word of God, and do and submit to His will, and are supported by His 
gifts and blessings, is nevertheless not without sin. For we still stumble daily and 
transgress because we live in the world among men who do us much harm and give 
us cause for impatience, anger, revenge, etc. 87] Besides, we have Satan at our back, 
who sets upon us on every side, and fights (as we have heard) against all the fore-
going petitions, so that it is not possible always to stand firm in such a persistent 
conflict.
88] Therefore there is here again great need to call upon God and to pray: Dear 
Father, forgive us our trespasses. Not as though He did not forgive sin without and 
even before our prayer (for He has given us the Gospel, in which is pure forgiveness 
before we prayed or ever thought about it). But this is to the intent that we may 
recognize and accept such forgiveness. 89] For since the flesh in which we daily 
live is of such a nature that it neither trusts nor believes God, and is ever active in 
evil lusts and devices, so that we sin daily in word and deed, by commission and 
omission, by which the conscience is thrown into unrest, so that it is afraid of the 
wrath and displeasure of God, and thus loses the comfort and confidence derived 
from the Gospel; therefore it is ceaselessly necessary that we run hither and obtain 
consolation to comfort the conscience again.
90] But this should serve God’s purpose of breaking our pride and keeping us 
humble. For in case any one should boast of his godliness and despise others, God 
has reserved this prerogative to Himself, that the person is to consider himself and 
place this prayer before his eyes, and he will find that he is no better than others, 
and that in the presence of God all must lower their plumes, and be glad that they 
can attain forgiveness. 91] And let no one think that as long as we live here he can 
reach such a position that he will not need such forgiveness. In short, if God does 
not forgive without ceasing, we are lost.
92] It is therefore the intent of this petition that God would not regard our sins 
and hold up to us what we daily deserve, but would deal graciously with us, and 
forgive, as He has promised, and thus grant us a joyful and confident conscience 
to stand before Him in prayer. For where the heart is not in right relation towards 
God, nor can take such confidence, it will nevermore venture to pray. But such a 
confident and joyful heart can spring from nothing else than the [certain] knowl-
edge of the forgiveness of sin.
The Large Catechism
409
93] But there is here attached a necessary, yet consolatory addition: As we forgive. 
He has promised that we shall be sure that everything is forgiven and pardoned, 
yet in the manner that we also forgive our neighbor. 94] For just as we daily sin 
much against God, and yet He forgives everything through grace, so we, too, must 
ever forgive our neighbor who does us injury, violence, and wrong, shows malice 
toward us, etc. 95] If, therefore, you do not forgive, then do not think that God 
forgives you; but if you forgive, you have this consolation and assurance, that you 
are forgiven in heaven, not on account of your forgiving, for God forgives freely 
and without condition, out of pure grace, because He has so promised, as the 
Gospel teaches, but in order that He may set this up for our confirmation and 
assurance for a sign alongside of the promise which accords with this prayer, Luke 
6:37: Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. Therefore Christ also repeats it soon after 
the Lord’s Prayer, and says, Matt. 6:14: For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your 
heavenly Father will also forgive you, etc.
97] This sign is therefore attached to this petition, that, when we pray, we remem-
ber the promise and reflect thus: Dear Father, for this reason I come and pray Thee 
to forgive me, not that I can make satisfaction, or can merit anything by my works, 
but because Thou hast promised and attached the seal thereto that I should be as 
sure as though I had absolution pronounced by Thyself. 98] For as much as Baptism 
and the Lord’s Supper, appointed as external signs, effect, so much also this sign 
can effect to confirm our consciences and cause them to rejoice. And it is especially 
given for this purpose, that we might use and practise it every hour, as a thing that 
we have with us at all times.
The Sixth Petition.
99] And lead us not into temptation.
100] We have now heard enough what toil and labor is required to retain all that 
for which we pray, and to persevere therein, which, however, is not achieved with-
out infirmities and stumbling. Besides, although we have received forgiveness and a 
good conscience and are entirely acquitted, yet is our life of such a nature that one 
stands to-day and to-morrow falls. Therefore, even though we be godly now and 
stand before God with a good conscience, we must pray again that He would not 
suffer us to relapse and yield to trials and temptations.
101] Temptation, however, or (as our Saxons in olden times used to call it) Bekoe-
runge, is of three kinds, namely, of the flesh, of the world, and of the devil. 102] 
For in the flesh we dwell and carry the old Adam about our neck, who exerts him-
The Lutheran Confessions
410
self and incites us daily to inchastity, laziness, gluttony and drunkenness, avarice 
and deception, to defraud our neighbor and to overcharge him, and, in short, to all 
manner of evil lusts which cleave to us by nature, and to which we are incited by 
the society, example and what we hear and see of other people, which often wound 
and inflame even an innocent heart.
103] Next comes the world, which offends us in word and deed, and impels us 
to anger, and impatience. In short, there is nothing but hatred and envy, enmity, 
violence and wrong, unfaithfulness, vengeance, cursing, raillery, slander, pride and 
haughtiness, with superfluous finery, honor, fame, and power, where no one is will-
ing to be the least, but every one desires to sit at the head and to be seen before all.
104] Then comes the devil, inciting and provoking in all directions, but especially 
agitating matters that concern the conscience and spiritual affairs, namely, to in-
duce us to despise and disregard both the Word and works of God, to tear us away 
from faith, hope, and love, and bring us into misbelief, false security, and obduracy, 
or, on the other hand, to despair, denial of God, blasphemy, and innumerable other 
shocking things. These are indeed snares and nets, yea, real fiery darts which are 
shot most venomously into the heart, not by flesh and blood, but by the devil.
105] Great and grievous, indeed, are these dangers and temptations which every 
Christian must bear, even though each one were alone by himself, so that every 
hour that we are in this vile life where we are attacked on all sides, chased and 
hunted down, we are moved to cry out and to pray that God would not suffer us to 
become weary and faint and to relapse into sin, shame, and unbelief. For otherwise 
it is impossible to overcome even the least temptation.
106] This, then, is leading us not into temptation, to wit, when He gives us power 
and strength to resist, the temptation, however, not being taken away or removed. 
For while we live in the flesh and have the devil about us, no one can escape temp-
tation and allurements; and it cannot be otherwise than that we must endure trials, 
yea, be engulfed in them; but we pray for this, that we may not fall and be drowned 
in them.
107] To feel temptation is therefore a far different thing from consenting or 
yielding to it. We must all feel it, although not all in the same manner, but some in 
a greater degree and more severely than others; as, the young suffer especially from 
the flesh, afterwards, they that attain to middle life and old age, from the world, 
but others who are occupied with spiritual matters, that is, strong Christians, 
from the devil. 108] But such feeling, as long as it is against our will and we would 
rather be rid of it, can harm no one. For if we did not feel it, it could not be called 
The Large Catechism
411
a temptation. But to consent thereto is when we give it the reins and do not resist 
or pray against it.
109] Therefore we Christians must be armed and daily expect to be incessantly 
attacked, in order that no one may go on in security and heedlessly, as though the 
devil were far from us, but at all times expect and parry his blows. For though I am 
now chaste, patient, kind, and in firm faith, the devil will this very hour send such 
an arrow into my heart that I can scarcely stand. For he is an enemy that never 
desists nor becomes tired, so that when one temptation ceases, there always arise 
others and fresh ones.
110] Accordingly, there is no help or comfort except to run hither and to take hold 
of the Lord’s Prayer, and thus speak to God from the heart: Dear Father, Thou hast 
bidden me pray; let me not relapse because of temptations. Then you will see that 
they must desist, and finally acknowledge themselves conquered. 111] Else if you 
venture to help yourself by your own thoughts and counsel, you will only make the 
matter worse and give the devil more space. For he has a serpent’s head, which if it 
gain an opening into which he can slip, the whole body will follow without check. 
But prayer can prevent him and drive him back.
The Seventh Petition.
112] But deliver us from evil. Amen.
113] In the Greek text this petition reads thus: Deliver or preserve us from the 
Evil One, or the Malicious One; and it looks as if He were speaking of the devil, as 
though He would comprehend everything in one, so that the entire substance of all 
our prayer is directed against our chief enemy. For it is he who hinders among us 
everything that we pray for: the name or honor of God, God’s kingdom and will, 
our daily bread, a cheerful good conscience, etc.
114] Therefore we finally sum it all up and say: Dear Father, pray, help that we be 
rid of all these calamities. 115] But there is nevertheless also included whatever evil 
may happen to us under the devil’s kingdom-poverty, shame, death, and, in short, 
all the agonizing misery and heartache of which there is such an unnumbered 
multitude on the earth. For since the devil is not only a liar, but also a murderer, he 
constantly seeks our life, and wreaks his anger whenever he can afflict our bodies 
with misfortune and harm. Hence it comes that he often breaks men’s necks or 
drives them to insanity, drowns some, and incites many to commit suicide, and to 
many other terrible calamities. 116] Therefore there is nothing for us to do upon 
The Lutheran Confessions
412
earth but to pray against this arch-enemy without ceasing. For unless God pre-
served us, we would not be safe from him even for an hour.
117] Hence you see again how God wishes us to pray to Him also for all the things 
which affect our bodily interests, so that we seek and expect help nowhere else ex-
cept in Him. 118] But this matter He has put last; for if we are to be preserved and 
delivered from all evil, the name of God must first be hallowed in us, His kingdom 
must be with us, and His will be done. After that He will finally preserve us from 
sin and shame, and, besides, from everything that may hurt or injure us.
119] Thus God has briefly placed before us all the distress which may ever come 
upon us, so that we might have no excuse whatever for not praying. But all depends 
upon this, that we learn also to say Amen, that is, that we do not doubt that our 
prayer is surely heard, and [what we pray] shall be done. For this is nothing else 
than the word of undoubting faith, which does not pray at a venture, but knows 
that God does not lie to him, since He has promised to grant it. 120]Therefore, 
where there is no such faith, there cannot be true prayer either.
121] It is, therefore, a pernicious delusion of those who pray in such a manner that 
they dare not from the heart say yea and positively conclude that God hears them, 
but remain in doubt and say, How should I be so bold as to boast that God hears 
my prayer? For I am but a poor sinner, etc.
122] The reason for this is, they regard not the promise of God, but their own 
work and worthiness, whereby they despise God and reproach Him with lying, and 
therefore they receive nothing. 123] As St. James 1:6 says: But let him ask in faith, 
nothing wavering; for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the 
wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the 
Lord. 124] Behold, such importance God attaches to the fact that we are sure we 
do not pray in vain, and that we do not in any way despise our prayer.
Holy Baptism
1] We have now finished the three chief parts of the common Christian doctrine. 
Besides these we have yet to speak of our two Sacraments instituted by Christ, of 
which also every Christian ought to have at least an ordinary, brief instruction, be-
cause without them there can be no Christian; although, alas! hitherto no instruc-
tion concerning them has been given. 2] But, in the first place, we take up Baptism, 
by which we are first received into the Christian Church. However, in order that it 
may be readily understood, we will treat of it in an orderly manner, and keep only 
The Large Catechism
413
to that which it is necessary for us to know. For how it is to be maintained and 
defended against heretics and sects we will commend to the learned.
3] In the first place, we must above all things know well the words upon which 
Baptism is founded, and to which everything refers that is to be said on the sub-
ject, namely, where the Lord Christ speaks in Matthew 28:19:
4] Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, 
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
Likewise in St. Mark 16:16: 5] He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but 
he that believeth not shall be damned.
6] In these words you must note, in the first place, that here stand God’s command-
ment and institution, lest we doubt that Baptism is divine, not devised nor invent-
ed by men. For as truly as I can say, No man has spun the Ten Commandments, 
the Creed, and the Lord’s Prayer out of his head, but they are revealed and given 
by God Himself, so also I can boast that Baptism is no human trifle, but institut-
ed by God Himself, moreover, that it is most solemnly and strictly commanded 
that we must be baptized or we cannot be saved, lest any one regard it as a trifling 
matter, like putting on a new red coat. 7] For it is of the greatest importance that 
we esteem Baptism 8] excellent, glorious, and exalted, for which we contend and 
fight chiefly, because the world is now so full of sects clamoring that Baptism is an 
external thing, and that external things are of no benefit. But let it be ever so much 
an external thing, here stand God’s Word and command which institute, establish, 
and confirm Baptism. But what God institutes and commands cannot be a vain, 
but must be a most precious thing, though in appearance it were of less value than 
a straw. 9] If hitherto people could consider it a great thing when the Pope with his 
letters and bulls dispensed indulgences and confirmed altars and churches, solely 
because of the letters and seals, we ought to esteem Baptism much more highly and 
more precious, because God has commanded it, and, besides, it is performed in His 
name. For these are the words, Go ye, baptize; however, not in your name, but in 
the name of God.
10] For to be baptized in the name of God is to be baptized not by men, but by 
God Himself. Therefore, although it is performed by human hands, it is never-
theless truly God’s own work. From this fact every one may himself readily infer 
that it is a far higher work than any work performed by a man or a saint. For what 
work greater than the work of God can we do?
The Lutheran Confessions
414
11] But here the devil is busy to delude us with false appearances, and lead us away 
from the work of God to our own works. For there is a much more splendid ap-
pearance when a Carthusian does many great and difficult works; and we all think 
much more of that which we do and merit ourselves. 12] But the Scriptures teach 
thus: Even though we collect in one mass the works of all the monks, however 
splendidly they may shine, they would not be as noble and good as if God should 
pick up a straw. Why? Because the person is nobler and better. Here, then, we must 
not estimate the person according to the works, but the works according to the 
person, from whom they must derive their nobility. 13] But insane reason will not 
regard this, and because Baptism does not shine like the works which we do, it is to 
be esteemed as nothing.
14] From this now learn a proper understanding of the subject, and how to answer 
the question what Baptism is, namely thus, that it is not mere ordinary water, but 
water comprehended in God’s Word and command, and sanctified thereby, so that 
it is nothing else than a divine water; not that the water in itself is nobler than 
other water, but that God’s Word and command are added.
15] Therefore it is pure wickedness and blasphemy of the devil that now our new 
spirits, to mock at Baptism, omit from it God’s Word and institution, and look 
upon it in no other way than as water which is taken from the well, and then blath-
er and say: How is a handful of water to help the soul? 16] Aye, my friend, who 
does not know that water is water if tearing things asunder is what we are after? 
But how dare you thus interfere with God’s order, and tear away the most precious 
treasure with which God has connected and enclosed it, and which He will not 
have separated? For the kernel in the water is God’s Word or command and the 
name of God, which is a treasure greater and nobler than heaven and earth.
17] Comprehend the difference, then, that Baptism is quite another thing than all 
other water; not on account of the natural quality but because something more 
noble is here added; for God Himself stakes His honor, His power and might on 
it. Therefore it is not only natural water, but a divine, heavenly, holy, and blessed 
water, and in whatever other terms we can praise it,-all on account of the Word, 
which is a heavenly, holy Word, that no one can sufficiently extol, for it has, and is 
able to do, all that God is and can do [since it has all the virtue and power of God 
comprised in it]. 18] Hence also it derives its essence as a Sacrament, as St. Augus-
tine also taught: Accedat verbum ad elementum et fit sacramentum. That is, when 
the Word is joined to the element or natural substance, it becomes a Sacrament, 
that is, a holy and divine matter and sign.
The Large Catechism
415
19] Therefore we always teach that the Sacraments and all external things which 
God ordains and institutes should not be regarded according to the coarse, ex-
ternal mask, as we regard the shell of a nut, but as the Word of God is included 
therein. 20] For thus we also speak of the parental estate and of civil government. 
If we propose to regard them in as far as they have noses, eyes, skin, and hair, flesh 
and bones, they look like Turks and heathen, and some one might start up and say: 
Why should I esteem them more than others? But because the commandment is 
added: Honor thy father and thy mother, I behold a different man, adorned and 
clothed with the majesty and glory of God. The commandment (I say) is the chain 
of gold about his neck, yea, the crown upon his head, which shows to me how and 
why one must honor this flesh and blood.
21] Thus, and much more even, you must honor Baptism and esteem it glorious on 
account of the Word, since He Himself has honored it both by words and deeds; 
moreover, confirmed it with miracles from heaven. For do you think it was a jest 
that, when Christ was baptized, the heavens were opened and the Holy Ghost 
descended visibly, and everything was divine glory and majesty?
22] Therefore I exhort again that these two, the water and the Word, by no means 
be separated from one another and parted. For if the Word is separated from it, the 
water is the same as that with which the servant cooks, and may indeed be called 
a bath-keeper’s baptism. But when it is added, as God has ordained, it is a Sacra-
ment, and is called Christ-baptism. Let this be the first part, regarding the essence 
and dignity of the holy Sacrament.
23] In the second place, since we know now what Baptism is, and how it is to be 
regarded, we must also learn why and for what purpose it is instituted; that is, 
what it profits, gives, and works. And this also we cannot discern better than from 
the words of Christ above quoted: He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. 
24] Therefore state it most simply thus, that the power, work, profit, fruit, and 
end of Baptism is this, namely, to save. For no one is baptized in order that he may 
become a prince, but, as the words declare, that he be saved. 25] But to be saved, 
we know, is nothing else than to be delivered from sin, death, and the devil, and to 
enter into the kingdom of Christ, and to live with Him forever.
26] Here you see again how highly and precious we should esteem Baptism, because 
in it we obtain such an unspeakable treasure, which also indicates sufficiently that 
it cannot be ordinary mere water. For mere water could not do such a thing, but 
the Word does it, and (as said above) the fact that the name of God is comprehend-
ed therein. 27] But where the name of God is, there must be also life and salvation, 
that it may indeed be called a divine, blessed, fruitful, and gracious water; for by 
The Lutheran Confessions
416
the Word such power is imparted to Baptism that it is a laver of regeneration, as 
St. Paul also calls it, Titus 3:5.
28] But as our would-be wise, new spirits assert that faith alone saves, and that 
works and external things avail nothing, we answer: It is true, indeed, that nothing 
in us is of any avail but faith, as we shall hear still further. 29] But these blind 
guides are unwilling to see this, namely, that faith must have something which it 
believes, that is, of which it takes hold, and upon which it stands and rests. Thus 
faith clings to the water, and believes that it is Baptism, in which there is pure sal-
vation and life; not through the water (as we have sufficiently stated), but through 
the fact that it is embodied in the Word and institution of God, and the name of 
God inheres in it. Now, if I believe this, what else is it than believing in God as in 
Him who has given and planted His Word into this ordinance, and proposes to us 
this external thing wherein we may apprehend such a treasure?
30] Now, they are so mad as to separate faith, and that to which faith clings and 
is bound, though it be something external. Yea, it shall and must be something 
external, that it may be apprehended by the senses, and understood and thereby be 
brought into the heart, as indeed the entire Gospel is an external, verbal preach-
ing. In short, what God does and works in us He proposes to work through such 
external ordinances. Wherever, therefore, He speaks, yea, in whichever direction 
or by whatever means He speaks, thither faith must look, and to that it must hold. 
31] Now here we have the words: He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. 
To what else do they refer than to Baptism, that is, to the water comprehended in 
God’s ordinance? Hence it follows that whoever rejects Baptism rejects the Word 
of God, faith, and Christ, who directs us thither and binds us to Baptism.
32] In the third place, since we have learned the great benefit and power of 
Baptism, let us see further who is the person that receives what Baptism gives and 
profits. 33] This is again most beautifully and clearly expressed in the words: He 
that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. That is, faith alone makes the person 
worthy to receive profitably the saving, divine water. For, since these blessings are 
here presented and promised in the words in and with the water, they cannot be 
received in any other way than by believing them with the heart. 34] Without faith 
it profits nothing, notwithstanding it is in itself a divine superabundant treasure. 
Therefore this single word (He that believeth) effects this much that it excludes 
and repels all works which we can do, in the opinion that we obtain and merit 
salvation by them. For it is determined that whatever is not faith avails nothing 
nor receives anything.
The Large Catechism
417
35] But if they say, as they are accustomed: Still Baptism is itself a work, and you 
say works are of no avail for salvation; what, then, becomes of faith? Answer: 
Yes, our works, indeed, avail nothing for salvation; Baptism, however, is not our 
work, but God’s (for, as was stated, you must put Christ-baptism far away from 
a bath-keeper’s baptism). God’s works, however, are saving and necessary for 
salvation, and do not exclude, but demand, faith; for without faith they could not 
be apprehended. 36] For by suffering the water to be poured upon you, you have 
not yet received Baptism in such a manner that it benefits you anything; but it 
becomes beneficial to you if you have yourself baptized with the thought that this 
is according to God’s command and ordinance, and besides in God’s name, in order 
that you may receive in the water the promised salvation. Now, this the fist cannot 
do, nor the body; but the heart must believe it.
37] Thus you see plainly that there is here no work done by us, but a treasure 
which He gives us, and which faith apprehends; just as the Lord Jesus Christ upon 
the cross is not a work, but a treasure comprehended in the Word, and offered to 
us and received by faith. Therefore they do us violence by exclaiming against us 
as though we preach against faith; while we alone insist upon it as being of such 
necessity that without it nothing can be received nor enjoyed.
38] Thus we have these three parts which it is necessary to know concerning this 
Sacrament, especially that the ordinance of God is to be held in all honor, which 
alone would be sufficient, though it be an entirely external thing, like the com-
mandment, Honor thy father and thy mother, which refers to bodily flesh and 
blood. Therein we regard not the flesh and blood, but the commandment of God 
in which they are comprehended, and on account of which the flesh is called father 
and mother; so also, though we had no more than these words, Go ye and baptize, 
etc., it would be necessary for us to accept and do it as the ordinance of God. 39] 
Now there is here not only God’s commandment and injunction, but also the 
promise, on account of which it is still far more glorious than whatever else God 
has commanded and ordained, and is, in short, so full of consolation and grace that 
heaven and earth cannot comprehend it. 40] But it requires skill to believe this, for 
the treasure is not wanting, but this is wanting that men apprehend it and hold it 
firmly.
41] Therefore every Christian has enough in Baptism to learn and to practise all his 
life; for he has always enough to do to believe firmly what it promises and brings: 
victory over death and the devil, forgiveness of sin, the grace of God, the entire 
Christ, and the Holy Ghost with His gifts. 42] In short, it is so transcendent that if 
timid nature could realize it, it might well doubt whether it could be true. 43] For 
consider, if there were somewhere a physician who understood the art of saving 
The Lutheran Confessions
418
men from dying, or, even though they died, of restoring them speedily to life, so 
that they would thereafter live forever, how the world would pour in money like 
snow and rain, so that because of the throng of the rich no one could find access! 
But here in Baptism there is brought free to every one’s door such a treasure and 
medicine as utterly destroys death and preserves all men alive.
44] Thus we must regard Baptism and make it profitable to ourselves, that when 
our sins and conscience oppress us, we strengthen ourselves and take comfort and 
say: Nevertheless I am baptized; but if I am baptized, it is promised me that I shall 
be saved and have eternal life, both in soul and body. 45] For that is the reason why 
these two things are done in Baptism, namely, that the body, which can apprehend 
nothing but the water, is sprinkled, and, in addition, the word is spoken for the 
soul to apprehend. 46] Now, since both, the water and the Word, are one Baptism, 
therefore body and soul must be saved and live forever: the soul through the Word 
which it believes, but the body because it is united with the soul and also appre-
hends Baptism as it is able to apprehend it. We have, therefore, no greater jewel in 
body and soul, for by it we are made holy and are saved, which no other kind of 
life, no work upon earth, can attain.
Let this suffice respecting the nature, blessing, and use of Baptism, for it answers 
the present purpose.
Of Infant Baptism.
47] Here a question occurs by which the devil, through his sects, confuses the 
world, namely, Of Infant Baptism, whether children also believe, and are justly 
baptized. Concerning this we say briefly: 48] Let the simple dismiss this question 
from their minds, and refer it to the learned. But if you wish to answer, 49] then 
answer thus:-
That the Baptism of infants is pleasing to Christ is sufficiently proved from His 
own work, namely, that God sanctifies many of them who have been thus baptized, 
and has given them the Holy Ghost; and that there are yet many even to-day in 
whom we perceive that they have the Holy Ghost both because of their doctrine 
and life; as it is also given to us by the grace of God that we can explain the Scrip-
tures and come to the knowledge of Christ, which is impossible without the Holy 
Ghost. 50] But if God did not accept the baptism of infants, He would not give 
the Holy Ghost nor any of His gifts to any of them; in short, during this long time 
unto this day no man upon earth could have been a Christian. Now, since God 
confirms Baptism by the gifts of His Holy Ghost, as is plainly perceptible in some 
The Large Catechism
419
of the church fathers, as St. Bernard, Gerson, John Hus, and others, who were bap-
tized in infancy, and since the holy Christian Church cannot perish until the end 
of the world, they must acknowledge that such infant baptism is pleasing to God. 
For He can never be opposed to Himself, or support falsehood and wickedness, or 
for its promotion impart His grace and Spirit. 51]This is indeed the best and stron-
gest proof for the simple-minded and unlearned. For they shall not take from us or 
overthrow this article: I believe a holy Christian Church, the communion of saints.
52] Further, we say that we are not so much concerned to know whether the per-
son baptized believes or not; for on that account Baptism does not become invalid; 
but everything depends upon the Word and command of God. 53] This now is per-
haps somewhat acute, but it rests entirely upon what I have said, that Baptism is 
nothing else than water and the Word of God in and with each other, that is, when 
the Word is added to the water, Baptism is valid, even though faith be wanting. For 
my faith does not make Baptism, but receives it. Now, Baptism does not become 
invalid even though it be wrongly received or employed; since it is not bound (as 
stated) to our faith, but to the Word.
54] For even though a Jew should to-day come dishonestly and with evil purpose, 
and we should baptize him in all good faith, we must say that his baptism is never-
theless genuine. For here is the water together with the Word of God, even though 
he does not receive it as he should, just as those who unworthily go to the Sacra-
ment receive the true Sacrament, even though they do not believe.
55] Thus you see that the objection of the sectarians is vain. For (as we have said) 
even though infants did not believe, which, however, is not the case, yet their 
baptism as now shown would be valid, and no one should rebaptize them; just as 
nothing is detracted from the Sacrament though some one approach it with evil 
purpose, and he could not be allowed on account of his abuse to take it a second 
time the selfsame hour, as though he had not received the true Sacrament at 
first; for that would mean to blaspheme and profane the Sacrament in the worst 
manner. How dare we think that God’s Word and ordinance should be wrong and 
invalid because we make a wrong use of it?
56] Therefore I say, if you did not believe then believe now and say thus: The 
baptism indeed was right, but I, alas! did not receive it aright. For I myself also, 
and all who are baptized, must speak thus before God: I come hither in my faith 
and in that of others, yet I cannot rest in this, that I believe, and that many people 
pray for me; but in this I rest, that it is Thy Word and command. Just as I go to 
the Sacrament trusting not in my faith, but in the Word of Christ; whether I am 
strong or weak, that I commit to God. But this I know, that He bids me go, eat and 
The Lutheran Confessions
420
drink, etc., and gives me His body and blood; that will not deceive me or prove 
false to me.
57] Thus we do also in infant baptism. We bring the child in the conviction and 
hope that it believes, and we pray that God may grant it faith; but we do not 
baptize it upon that, but solely upon the command of God. Why so? Because we 
know that God does not lie. I and my neighbor and, in short, all men, may err and 
deceive, but the Word of God cannot err.
58] Therefore they are presumptuous, clumsy minds that draw such inferences and 
conclusions as these: Where there is not the true faith, there also can be no true 
Baptism. Just as if I would infer: If I do not believe, then Christ is nothing; or thus: 
If I am not obedient, then father, mother, and government are nothing. Is that a 
correct conclusion, that whenever any one does not do what he ought, the thing 
in itself shall be nothing and of no value? 59] My dear, just invert the argument 
and rather draw this inference: For this very reason Baptism is something and is 
right, because it has been wrongly received. For if it were not right and true in 
itself, it could not be misused nor sinned against. The saying is: Abusus non tollit, sed 
confirmat substantiam, Abuse does not destroy the essence, but confirms it. For gold 
is not the less gold though a harlot wear it in sin and shame.
60] Therefore let it be decided that Baptism always remains true, retains its full es-
sence, even though a single person should be baptized, and he, in addition, should 
not believe truly. For God’s ordinance and Word cannot be made variable or be al-
tered by men. 61] But these people, the fanatics, are so blinded that they do not see 
the Word and command of God, and regard Baptism and the magistrates only as 
they regard water in the brook or in pots, or as any other man; and because they do 
not see faith nor obedience, they conclude that they are to be regarded as invalid. 
62] Here lurks a concealed seditious devil, who would like to tear the crown from 
the head of authority and then trample it under foot, and, in addition, pervert and 
bring to naught all the works and ordinances of God. 63] Therefore we must be 
watchful and well armed, and not allow ourselves to be directed nor turned away 
from the Word, in order that we may not regard Baptism as a mere empty sign, as 
the fanatics dream.
64] Lastly, we must also know what Baptism signifies, and why God has ordained 
just such external sign and ceremony for the Sacrament by which we are first 
received into the Christian Church. 65] But the act or ceremony is this, that we 
are sunk under the water, which passes over us, and afterwards are drawn out 
again. These two parts, to be sunk under the water and drawn out again, signify the 
power and operation of Baptism, which is nothing else than putting to death the 
The Large Catechism
421
old Adam, and after that the resurrection of the new man, both of which must take 
place in us all our lives, so that a truly Christian life is nothing else than a daily 
baptism, once begun and ever to be continued. For this must be practised without 
ceasing, that we ever keep purging away whatever is of the old Adam, and that 
that which belongs to the new man come forth. 66] But what is the old man? It is 
that which is born in us from Adam, angry, hateful, envious, unchaste, stingy, lazy, 
haughty, yea, unbelieving, infected with all vices, and having by nature nothing 
good in it. 67] Now, when we are come into the kingdom of Christ, these things 
must daily decrease, that the longer we live we become more gentle, more patient, 
more meek, and ever withdraw more and more from unbelief, avarice, hatred, envy, 
haughtiness.
68] This is the true use of Baptism among Christians, as signified by baptizing with 
water. Where this, therefore, is not practised, but the old man is left unbridled, so 
as to continually become stronger, that is not using Baptism, but striving against 
Baptism. 69] For those who are without Christ cannot but daily become worse, 
according to the proverb which expresses the truth, “Worse and worse-the longer, 
the worse.” 70] If a year ago one was proud and avaricious, then he is much prouder 
and more avaricious this year, so that the vice grows and increases with him from 
his youth up. A young child has no special vice; but when it grows up, it becomes 
unchaste and impure, and when it reaches maturity, real vices begin to prevail the 
longer, the more.
71] Therefore the old man goes unrestrained in his nature if he is not checked and 
suppressed by the power of Baptism. On the other hand, where men have become 
Christians, he daily decreases until he finally perishes. That is truly to be buried in 
Baptism, and daily to come forth again. 72] Therefore the external sign is appoint-
ed not only for a powerful effect, but also for a signification. 73] Where, therefore, 
faith flourishes with its fruits, there it has no empty signification, but the work [of 
mortifying the flesh] accompanies it; but where faith is wanting, it remains a mere 
unfruitful sign.
74] And here you see that Baptism, both in its power and signification, compre-
hends also the third Sacrament, which has been called repentance, 75] as it is really 
nothing else than Baptism. For what else is repentance but an earnest attack upon 
the old man [that his lusts be restrained] and entering upon a new life? Therefore, 
if you live in repentance, you walk in Baptism, which not only signifies such a new 
life, but also produces, begins, and exercises it. 76] For therein are given grace, the 
Spirit, and power to suppress the old man, so that the new man may come forth 
and become strong.
The Lutheran Confessions
422
77] Therefore our Baptism abides forever; and even though some one should fall 
from it and sin, nevertheless we always have access thereto, that we may again 
subdue the old man. 78] But we need not again be sprinkled with water; for though 
we were put under the water a hundred times, it would nevertheless be only one 
Baptism, although the operation and signification continue and remain. 79] Re-
pentance, therefore, is nothing else than a return and approach to Baptism, that we 
repeat and practise what we began before, but abandoned.
80] This I say lest we fall into the opinion in which we were for a long time, 
imagining that our Baptism is something past, which we can no longer use after we 
have fallen again into sin. The reason is, that it is regarded only according to the 
external act once performed [and completed]. 81] And this arose from the fact that 
St. Jerome wrote that repentance is the second plank by which we must swim forth and 
cross over after the ship is broken, on which we step and are carried across when we come 
into the Christian Church. 82] Thereby the use of Baptism has been abolished so that 
it can profit us no longer. Therefore the statement is not correct, or at any rate not 
rightly understood. For the ship never breaks, because (as we have said) it is the 
ordinance of God, and not a work of ours; but it happens, indeed, that we slip and 
fall out of the ship. Yet if any one fall out, let him see to it that he swim up and 
cling to it till he again come into it and live in it, as he had formerly begun.
83] Thus it appears what a great, excellent thing Baptism is, which delivers us from 
the jaws of the devil and makes us God’s own, suppresses and takes away sin, and 
then daily strengthens the new man; and is and remains ever efficacious until we 
pass from this estate of misery to eternal glory.
84] For this reason let every one esteem his Baptism as a daily dress in which he 
is to walk constantly, that he may ever be found in the faith and its fruits, that he 
suppress the old man and grow up in the new. 85] For if we would be Christians, 
we must practise the work whereby we are Christians. 86] But if any one fall away 
from it, let him again come into it. For just as Christ, the Mercy-seat, does not 
recede from us or forbid us to come to Him again, even though we sin, so all His 
treasure and gifts also remain. If, therefore, we have once in Baptism obtained 
forgiveness of sin, it will remain every day, as long as we live, that is, as long as we 
carry the old man about our neck.
The Sacrament of the Altar
1] In the same manner as we have heard regarding Holy Baptism, we must speak 
also concerning the other Sacrament, namely, these three points: What is it? What 
The Large Catechism
423
are its benefits? and, Who is to receive it? And all these are established by the 
words by which Christ has instituted it, 2] and which every one who desires to be 
a Christian and go to the Sacrament should know. For it is not our intention to ad-
mit to it and to administer it to those who know not what they seek, or why they 
come. The words, however, are these:
3] Our Lord Jesus Christ, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread; 
and when He had given thanks, He brake it, and gave it to His disciples, and said, 
Take, eat; this is My body, which is given for you: this do in remembrance of Me.
After the same manner also He took the cup when He had supped, gave thanks, 
and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; this cup is the new testament in My 
blood, which is shed for you for the remission of sins: this do ye, as oft as ye drink 
it, in remembrance of Me.
4] Here also we do not wish to enter into controversy and contend with the traduc-
ers and blasphemers of this Sacrament, but to learn first (as we did regarding Bap-
tism) what is of the greatest importance, namely, that the chief point is the Word 
and ordinance or command of God. For it has not been invented nor introduced 
by any man, but without any one’s counsel and deliberation it has been instituted 
by Christ. 5] Therefore, just as the Ten Commandments, the Lord’s Prayer, and 
the Creed retain their nature and worth, although you never keep, pray, or believe 
them, so also does this venerable Sacrament remain undisturbed, so that nothing is 
detracted or taken from it, even though we employ and dispense it unworthily. 6] 
What do you think God cares about what we do or believe, so that on that account 
He should suffer His ordinance to be changed? Why, in all worldly matters every 
thing remains as God has created and ordered it, no matter how we employ or use 
it. 7] This must always be urged, for thereby the prating of nearly all the fanatical 
spirits can be repelled. For they regard the Sacraments, aside from the Word of 
God, as something that we do.
8] Now, what is the Sacrament of the Altar?
Answer: It is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, in and under the 
bread and wine which we Christians are commanded by the Word of Christ to eat 
and to drink. 9] And as we have said of Baptism that it is not simple water, so here 
also we say the Sacrament is bread and wine, but not mere bread and wine, such 
as are ordinarily served at the table, but bread and wine comprehended in, and 
connected with, the Word of God.
The Lutheran Confessions
424
10] It is the Word (I say) which makes and distinguishes this Sacrament, so that it 
is not mere bread and wine, but is, and is called, the body and blood of Christ. For 
it is said: Accedat verbum ad elementum, et fit sacramentum. If the Word be joined to 
the element, it becomes a Sacrament. This saying of St. Augustine is so properly 
and so well put that he has scarcely said anything better. The Word must make a 
Sacrament of the element, else it remains a mere element. 11]Now, it is not the 
word or ordinance of a prince or emperor, but of the sublime Majesty, at whose 
feet all creatures should fall, and affirm it is as He says, and accept it with all rever-
ence, fear, and humility.
12] With this Word you can strengthen your conscience and say: If a hundred 
thousand devils, together with all fanatics, should rush forward, crying, How can 
bread and wine be the body and blood of Christ? etc., I know that all spirits and 
scholars together are not as wise as is the Divine Majesty in His little finger. 13]
Now here stands the Word of Christ: Take, eat; this is My body; Drink ye all of it; this 
is the new testament in My blood, etc. Here we abide, and would like to see those who 
will constitute themselves His masters, and make it different from what He has 
spoken. It is true, indeed, that if you take away the Word or regard it without the 
words, you have nothing but mere bread and wine. 14] But if the words remain 
with them, as they shall and must, then, in virtue of the same, it is truly the body 
and blood of Christ. For as the lips of Christ say and speak, so it is, as He can never 
lie or deceive.
15] Hence it is easy to reply to all manner of questions about which men are trou-
bled at the present time, such as this one: Whether even a wicked priest can min-
ister at, and dispense, the Sacrament, and whatever other questions like this there 
may be. 16] For here we conclude and say: Even though a knave takes or distributes 
the Sacrament, he receives the true Sacrament, that is, the true body and blood of 
Christ, just as truly as he who [receives or] administers it in the most worthy man-
ner. For it is not founded upon the holiness of men, but upon the Word of God. 
And as no saint upon earth, yea, no angel in heaven, can make bread and wine to 
be the body and blood of Christ, so also can no one change or alter it, even though 
it be misused. 17] For the Word by which it became a Sacrament and was institut-
ed does not become false because of the person or his unbelief. For He does not 
say: If you believe or are worthy, you receive My body and blood, but: Take, eat and 
drink; this is My body and blood. Likewise: Do this(namely, what I now do, institute, 
give, and bid you take). 18] That is as much as to say, No matter whether you are 
worthy or unworthy, you have here His body and blood by virtue of these words 
which are added to the bread and wine. 19] Only note and remember this well; for 
upon these words rest all our foundation, protection, and defense against all errors 
and deception that have ever come or may yet come.
The Large Catechism
425
20] Thus we have briefly the first point which relates to the essence of this Sacra-
ment. Now examine further the efficacy and benefits on account of which really 
the Sacrament was instituted; which is also its most necessary part, that we may 
know what we should seek and obtain there. 21] Now this is plain and clear from 
the words just mentioned: This is My body and blood, given and shed for you, for the 
remission of sins. 22] Briefly that is as much as to say: For this reason we go to the 
Sacrament because there we receive such a treasure by and in which we obtain for-
giveness of sins. Why so? Because the words stand here and give us this; for on this 
account He bids me eat and drink, that it may be my own and may benefit me, as a 
sure pledge and token, yea, the very same treasure that is appointed for me against 
my sins, death, and every calamity.
23] On this account it is indeed called a food of souls, which nourishes and 
strengthens the new man. For by Baptism we are first born anew; but (as we said 
before) there still remains, besides, the old vicious nature of flesh and blood in 
man, and there are so many hindrances and temptations of the devil and of the 
world that we often become weary and faint, and sometimes also stumble.
24] Therefore it is given for a daily pasture and sustenance, that faith may re-
fresh and strengthen itself so as not to fall back in such a battle, but become ever 
stronger and stronger. 25] For the new life must be so regulated that it continually 
increase and progress; 26] but it must suffer much opposition. For the devil is such 
a furious enemy that when he sees that we oppose him and attack the old man, 
and that he cannot topple us over by force, he prowls and moves about on all sides, 
tries all devices, and does not desist, until he finally wearies us, so that we either 
renounce our faith or yield hands and feet and become listless or impatient. 27] 
Now to this end the consolation is here given when the heart feels that the burden 
is becoming too heavy, that it may here obtain new power and refreshment.
28] But here our wise spirits contort themselves with their great art and wisdom, 
crying out and bawling: How can bread and wine forgive sins or strengthen faith? 
Although they hear and know that we do not say this of bread and wine, because in 
itself bread is bread, but of such bread and wine as is the body and blood of Christ, 
and has the words attached to it. That, we say, is verily the treasure, and nothing 
else, through which such forgiveness is obtained. 29] Now the only way in which 
it is conveyed and appropriated to us is in the words (Given and shed for you). For 
herein you have both truths, that it is the body and blood of Christ, and that it is 
yours as a treasure and gift. 30] Now the body of Christ can never be an unfruitful, 
vain thing, that effects or profits nothing. Yet, however great is the treasure in it-
self, it must be comprehended in the Word and administered to us, else we should 
never be able to know or seek it.
The Lutheran Confessions
426
31] Therefore also it is vain talk when they say that the body and blood of Christ 
are not given and shed for us in the Lord’s Supper, hence we could not have for-
giveness of sins in the Sacrament. For although the work is accomplished and the 
forgiveness of sins acquired on the cross, yet it cannot come to us in any other way 
than through the Word. For what would we otherwise know about it, that such a 
thing was accomplished or was to be given us if it were not presented by preaching 
or the oral Word? Whence do they know of it, or how can they apprehend and 
appropriate to themselves the forgiveness, except they lay hold of and believe the 
Scriptures and the Gospel? 32] But now the entire Gospel and the article of the 
Creed: I believe a holy Christian Church, the forgiveness of sin, etc., are by the 
Word embodied in this Sacrament and presented to us. Why, then, should we allow 
this treasure to be torn from the Sacrament when they must confess that these are 
the very words which we hear every where in the Gospel, and they cannot say that 
these words in the Sacrament are of no use, as little as they dare say that the entire 
Gospel or Word of God, apart from the Sacrament, is of no use?
33] Thus we have the entire Sacrament, both as to what it is in itself and as to what 
it brings and profits. Now we must also see who is the person that receives this 
power and benefit. That is answered briefly, as we said above of Baptism and often 
elsewhere: Whoever believes it has what the words declare and bring. For they 
are not spoken or proclaimed to stone and wood, but to those who hear them, to 
whom He says: 34]Take and eat, etc. And because He offers and promises forgive-
ness of sin, it cannot be received otherwise than by faith. This faith He Himself 
demands in the Word when He says: Given and shed for you. As if He said: For 
this reason I give it, and bid you eat and drink, that you may claim it as yours and 
enjoy it. 35] Whoever now accepts these words, and believes that what they declare 
is true, has it. But whoever does not believe it has nothing, as he allows it to be of-
fered to him in vain, and refuses to enjoy such a saving good. The treasure, indeed, 
is opened and placed at every one’s door, yea, upon his table, but it is necessary 
that you also claim it, and confidently view it as the words suggest to you 36] This, 
now, is the entire Christian preparation for receiving this Sacrament worthily. For 
since this treasure is entirely presented in the words, it cannot be apprehended and 
appropriated in any other way than with the heart. For such a gift and eternal trea-
sure cannot be seized with the fist. 37] Fasting and prayer, etc., may indeed be an 
external preparation and discipline for children, that the body may keep and bear 
itself modestly and reverently towards the body and blood of Christ; yet what is 
given in and with it the body cannot seize and appropriate. But this is done by the 
faith of the heart, which discerns this treasure and desires it. 38]This may suffice 
for what is necessary as a general instruction respecting this Sacrament; for what is 
further to be said of it belongs to another time.
The Large Catechism
427
39] In conclusion, since we have now the true understanding and doctrine of the 
Sacrament, there is indeed need of some admonition and exhortation, that men 
may not let so great a treasure which is daily administered and distributed among 
Christians pass by unheeded, that is, that those who would be Christians make 
ready to receive this venerable Sacrament often. 40] For we see that men seem 
weary and lazy with respect to it; and there is a great multitude of such as hear 
the Gospel, and, because the nonsense of the Pope has been abolished, and we are 
freed from his laws and coercion, go one, two, three years, or even longer without 
the Sacrament, as though they were such strong Christians that they have no need 
of it; 41] and some allow themselves to be prevented and deterred by the pretense 
that we have taught that no one should approach it except those who feel hunger 
and thirst, which urge them to it. Some pretend that it is a matter of liberty and 
not necessary, and that it is sufficient to believe without it; and thus for the most 
part they go so far that they become quite brutish, and finally despise both the 
Sacrament and the Word of God.
42] Now, it is true, as we have said, that no one should by any means be coerced 
or compelled, lest we institute a new murdering of souls. Nevertheless, it must 
be known that such people as deprive themselves of, and withdraw from, the 
Sacrament so long a time are not to be considered Christians. For Christ has not 
instituted it to be treated as a show, but has commanded His Christians to eat and 
drink it, and thereby remember Him.
43] And, indeed, those who are true Christians and esteem the Sacrament precious 
and holy will urge and impel themselves unto it. Yet that the simple-minded and 
the weak who also would like to be Christians be the more incited to consider the 
cause and need which ought to impel them, we will treat somewhat of this point. 
44] For as in other matters pertaining to faith, love, and patience, it is not enough 
to teach and instruct only, but there is need also of daily exhortation, so here also 
there is need of continuing to preach that men may not become weary and disgust-
ed, since we know and feel how the devil always opposes this and every Christian 
exercise, and drives and deters therefrom as much as he can.
45] And we have, in the first place, the clear text in the very words of Christ: Do 
this in remembrance of Me. These are bidding and commanding words by which 
all who would be Christians are enjoined to partake of this Sacrament. Therefore, 
whoever would be a disciple of Christ, with whom He here speaks, must also 
consider and observe this, not from compulsion, as being forced by men, but in 
obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ, and to please Him. 46] However, if you say: But 
the words are added, As oft as ye do it; there He compels no one, but leaves it to 
our free choice, answer: 47] That is true, yet it is not written that we should never 
do so. Yea, just because He speaks the words, As oft as ye do it, it is nevertheless 
The Lutheran Confessions
428
implied that we should do it often; and it is added for the reason that He wishes to 
have the Sacrament free, not limited to special times, like the Passover of the Jews, 
which they were obliged to eat only once a year, and that just upon the fourteenth 
day of the first full moon in the evening, and which they must not vary a day. As 
if He would say by these words: I institute a Passover or Supper for you which you 
shall enjoy not only once a year, just upon this evening, but often, when and where 
you will, according to every one’s opportunity and necessity, bound to no place or 
appointed time; 48] although the Pope afterwards perverted it, and again made a 
Jewish feast of it.
49] Thus, you perceive, it is not left free in the sense that we may despise it. For 
that I call despising it if one allow so long a time to elapse and with nothing to 
hinder him yet never feels a desire for it. if you wish such liberty, you may just as 
well have the liberty to be no Christian, and neither have to believe nor pray; for 
the one is just as much the command of Christ as the other. But if you wish to be 
a Christian, you must from time to time render satisfaction and obedience to this 
commandment. 50] For this commandment ought ever to move you to examine 
yourself and to think: See, what sort of a Christian I am! If I were one, I would cer-
tainly have some little longing for that which my Lord has commanded [me] to do.
51] And, indeed, since we act such strangers to it, it is easily seen what sort of 
Christians we were under the Papacy, namely, that we went from mere compulsion 
and fear of human commandments, without inclination and love, and never re-
garded the commandment of Christ. 52] But we neither force nor compel any one; 
nor need any one do it to serve or please us. But this should induce and constrain 
you by itself, that He desires it and that it is pleasing to Him. You must not suffer 
men to coerce you unto faith or any good work. We are doing no more than to say 
and exhort you as to what you ought to do, not for our sake, but for your own sake. 
He invites and allures you; if you despise it, you must answer for it yourself.
53] Now, this is to be the first point, especially for those who are cold and indiffer-
ent, that they may reflect upon and rouse themselves. For this is certainly true, as I 
have found in my own experience, and as every one will find in his own case, that if 
a person thus withdraw from this Sacrament, he will daily become more and more 
callous and cold, and will at last disregard it altogether. 54] To avoid this, we must, 
indeed, examine heart and conscience, and act like a person who desires to be right 
with God. Now, the more this is done, the more will the heart be warmed and 
enkindled, that it may not become entirely cold.
55] But if you say: How if I feel that I am not prepared? Answer: That is also my 
scruple, especially from the old way under the Pope, in which a person tortured 
himself to be so perfectly pure that God could not find the least blemish in us. On 
The Large Catechism
429
this account we became so timid that every one was instantly thrown into conster-
nation and said to himself: Alas! you are unworthy! 56] For then nature and reason 
begin to reckon our unworthiness in comparison with the great and precious good; 
and then it appears like a dark lantern in contrast with the bright sun, or as filth 
in comparison with precious stones. Because nature and reason see this, they refuse 
to approach and tarry until they are prepared, so long that one week trails another, 
and one half year the other. 57] But if you are to regard how good and pure you 
are, and labor to have no compunctions, you must never approach.
58] We must, therefore, make a distinction here among men. For those who are 
wanton and dissolute must be told to stay away; for they are not prepared to 
receive forgiveness of sin, since they do not desire it and do not wish to be godly. 
59] But the others, who are not such callous and wicked people, and desire to be 
godly, must not absent themselves, even though otherwise they be feeble and full 
of infirmities, as St. Hilary also has said: If any one have not committed sin for 
which he can rightly be put out of the congregation and esteemed as no Christian, 
he ought not stay away from the Sacrament, lest he may deprive himself of life. 60] 
For no one will make such progress that he will not retain many daily infirmities in 
flesh and blood.
61] Therefore such people must learn that it is the highest art to know that our 
Sacrament does not depend upon our worthiness. For we are not baptized be-
cause we are worthy and holy, nor do we go to confession because we are pure and 
without sin, but the contrary, because we are poor miserable men, and just because 
we are unworthy; unless it be some one who desires no grace and absolution nor 
intends to reform.
62] But whoever would gladly obtain grace and consolation should impel himself, 
and allow no one to frighten him away, but say: I, indeed, would like to be wor-
thy; but I come, not upon any worthiness, but upon Thy Word, because Thou hast 
commanded it, as one who would gladly be Thy disciple, no matter what becomes 
of my worthiness. 63] But this is difficult; for we always have this obstacle and 
hindrance to encounter, that we look more upon ourselves than upon the Word 
and lips of Christ. For nature desires so to act that it can stand and rest firmly on 
itself, otherwise it refuses to make the approach. Let this suffice concerning the 
first point.
64] In the second place, there is besides this command also a promise, as we heard 
above, which ought most strongly to incite and encourage us. For here stand the 
kind and precious words: This is My body, given for you. This is My blood, shed 
for you, for the remission of sins. 65] These words, I have said, are not preached to

wood and stone, but to me and you; else He might just as well be silent and not 
institute a Sacrament. Therefore consider, and put yourself into this You, that He 
may not speak to you in vain.
66] For here He offers to us the entire treasure which He has brought for us from 
heaven, and to which He invites us also in other places with the greatest kindness, 
as when He says in St. Matthew 11:28: Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are 
heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 67] Now it is surely a sin and a shame that 
He so cordially and faithfully summons and exhorts us to our highest and greatest 
good, and we act so distantly with regard to it, and permit so long a time to pass 
[without partaking of the Sacrament] that we grow quite cold and hardened, so 
that we have no inclination or love for it. 68] We must never regard the Sacrament 
as something injurious from which we had better flee, but as a pure, wholesome, 
comforting remedy imparting salvation and comfort, which will cure you and give 
you life both in soul and body. For where the soul has recovered, the body also 
is relieved. Why, then, is it that we act as if it were a poison, the eating of which 
would bring death?
69] To be sure, it is true that those who despise it and live in an unchristian man-
ner receive it to their hurt and damnation; for nothing shall be good or whole-
some to them, just as with a sick person who from caprice eats and drinks what is 
forbidden him by the physician. 70] But those who are sensible of their weakness, 
desire to be rid of it and long for help, should regard and use it only as a precious 
antidote against the poison which they have in them. For here in the Sacrament 
you are to receive from the lips of Christ forgiveness of sin, which contains and 
brings with it the grace of God and the Spirit with all His gifts, protection, shelter, 
and power against death and the devil and all misfortune.
71] Thus you have, on the part of God, both the command and the promise of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. Besides this, on your part, your own distress which is about your 
neck, and because of which this command, invitation, and promise are given, ought 
to impel you. For He Himself says: They that be whole, need not a physician, but 
they that be sick; that is, those who are weary and heavy-laden with their sins, with 
the fear of death, temptations of the flesh and of the devil. 72] If, therefore, you are 
heavy-laden and feel your weakness, then go joyfully to this Sacrament and obtain 
refreshment, consolation, and strength. 73] For if you would wait until you are rid 
of such burdens, that you might come to the Sacrament pure and worthy, you must 
forever stay away. For in that case He pronounces sentence and says: 74] If you are 
pure and godly, you have no need of Me, and I, in turn, none of thee. Therefore 
those alone are called unworthy who neither feel their infirmities nor wish to be 
considered sinners.
The Large Catechism
431
75] But if you say: What, then, shall I do if I cannot feel such distress or experience 
hunger and thirst for the Sacrament? Answer: For those who are so minded that 
they do not realize their condition I know no better counsel than that they put 
their hand into their bosom to ascertain whether they also have flesh and blood. 
And if you find that to be the case, then go, for your good, to St. Paul’s Epistle to 
the Galatians, and hear what sort of a fruit your flesh is: Now the works of the 
flesh (he says [Gal. 5:19ff]) are manifest, which are these: Adultery, fornication, un-
cleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, 
strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like.
76] Therefore, if you cannot feel it, at least believe the Scriptures; they will not 
lie to you, and they know your flesh better than you yourself. Yea, St. Paul further 
concludes in Rom. 7:18: I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good 
thing. If St. Paul may speak thus of his flesh, we do not propose to be better nor 
more holy. 77] But that we do not feel it is so much the worse; for it is a sign that 
there is a leprous flesh which feels nothing, and yet [the leprosy] rages and keeps 
spreading. 78] Yet, as we have said, if you are quite dead to all sensibility, still 
believe the Scriptures, which pronounce sentence upon you. And, in short, the less 
you feel your sins and infirmities, the more reason have you to go to the Sacrament 
to seek help and a remedy.
79] In the second place, look about you and see whether you are also in the world, 
or if you do not know it, ask your neighbors about it. If you are in the world, do 
not think that there will be lack of sins and misery. For only begin to act as though 
you would be godly and adhere to the Gospel, and see whether no one will become 
your enemy, and, moreover, do you harm, wrong, and violence, and likewise give 
you cause for sin and vice. If you have not experienced it, then let the Scriptures 
tell you, which everywhere give this praise and testimony to the world.
80] Besides this, you will also have the devil about you, whom you will not entirely 
tread under foot, because our Lord Christ Himself could not entirely avoid him. 
Now, what is the devil? 81] Nothing else than what the Scriptures call him, a liar 
and murderer. A liar, to lead the heart astray from the Word of God, and to blind 
it, that you cannot feel your distress or come to Christ. A murderer, who cannot 
bear to see you live one single hour. 82] If you could see how many knives, darts, 
and arrows are every moment aimed at you, you would be glad to come to the 
Sacrament as often as possible. But there is no reason why we walk so securely and 
heedlessly, except that we neither think nor believe that we are in the flesh, and in 
this wicked world or in the kingdom of the devil.
The Lutheran Confessions
432
83] Therefore, try this and practise it well, and do but examine yourself, or look 
about you a little, and only keep to the Scriptures. If even then you still feel 
nothing, you have so much the more misery to lament both to God and to your 
brother. Then take advice and have others pray for you, and do not desist until the 
stone be removed from your heart. 84] Then, indeed, the distress will not fail to 
become manifest, and you will find that you have sunk twice as deep as any other 
poor sinner, and are much more in need of the Sacrament against the misery which 
unfortunately you do not see, so that, with the grace of God, you may feel it more 
and become the more hungry for the Sacrament, especially since the devil plies his 
force against you, and lies in wait for you without ceasing to seize and destroy you, 
soul and body, so that you are not safe from him one hour. How soon can he have 
brought you suddenly into misery and distress when you least expect it!
85] Let this, then, be said for exhortation, not only for those of us who are old and 
grown, but also for the young people, who ought to be brought up in the Christian 
doctrine and understanding. For thereby the Ten Commandments, the Creed, and 
the Lord’s Prayer might be the more easily inculcated to our youth, so that they 
would receive them with pleasure and earnestness, and thus would practise them 
from their youth and accustom themselves to them. 86] For the old are now well-
nigh done for, so that these and other things cannot be attained, unless we train 
the people who are to come after us and succeed us in our office and work, in order 
that they also may bring up their children successfully, that the Word of God and 
the Christian Church may be preserved. 87] Therefore let every father of a family 
know that it is his duty, by the injunction and command of God, to teach these 
things to his children, or have them learn what they ought to know. For since they 
are baptized and received into the Christian Church, they should also enjoy this 
communion of the Sacrament, in order that they may serve us and be useful to us; 
for they must all indeed help us to believe, love, pray, and fight against the devil.

Epitome of the Formula of Concord
Comprehensive Summary, Rule and Norm According to which all 
dogmas should be judged, and the erroneous teachings [contro-
versies]that have occurred should be decided and explained in a 
Christian way.
1] 1. We believe, teach, and confess that the sole rule and standard according to 
which all dogmas together with [all] teachers should be estimated and judged are 
the prophetic and apostolic Scriptures of the Old and of the New Testament alone, 
as it is written Ps. 119:105: Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my 
path. And St. Paul: Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you, 
let him be accursed, Gal. 1:8.
2] Other writings, however, of ancient or modern teachers, whatever name they 
bear, must not be regarded as equal to the Holy Scriptures, but all of them together 
be subjected to them, and should not be received otherwise or further than as 
witnesses, [which are to show] in what manner after the time of the apostles, and at 
what places, this [pure] doctrine of the prophets and apostles was preserved.
3] 2. And because directly after the times of the apostles, and even while they 
were still living, false teachers and heretics arose, and symbols, i. e., brief, succinct 
[categorical] confessions, were composed against them in the early Church, which 
were regarded as the unanimous, universal Christian faith and confession of the 
orthodox and true Church, namely, the Apostles’ Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the 
Athanasian Creed, we pledge ourselves to them, and hereby reject all heresies and 
dogmas which, contrary to them, have been introduced into the Church of God.
4] 3. As to the schisms in matters of faith, however, which have occurred in our 
time, we regard as the unanimous consensus and declaration of our Christian 
faith and confession, especially against the Papacy and its false worship, idolatry, 
superstition, and against other sects, as the symbol of our time, the First, Unaltered 
Augsburg Confession, delivered to the Emperor Charles V at Augsburg in the year 
1530, in the great Diet, together with its Apology, and the Articles composed at 
Smalcald in the year 1537, and subscribed at that time by the chief theologians.
5] And because such matters concern also the laity and the salvation of their souls, 
we also confess the Small and Large Catechisms of Dr. Luther, as they are included 
in Luther’s works, as the Bible of the laity, wherein everything is comprised which 
is treated at greater length in Holy Scripture, and is necessary for a Christian man 
to know for his salvation.
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
435
6] To this direction, as above announced, all doctrines are to be conformed, and 
what is, contrary thereto is to be rejected and condemned, as opposed to the unani-
mous declaration of our faith.
7] In this way the distinction between the Holy Scriptures of the Old and of the 
New Testament and all other writings is preserved, and the Holy Scriptures alone 
remain the only judge, rule, and standard, according to which, as the only test-
stone, all dogmas shall and must be discerned and judged, as to whether they are 
good or evil, right or wrong.
8] But the other symbols and writings cited are not judges, as are the Holy Scrip-
tures, but only a testimony and declaration of the faith, as to how at any time the 
Holy Scriptures have been understood and explained in the articles in controver-
sy in the Church of God by those then living, and how the opposite dogma was 
rejected and condemned [by what arguments the dogmas conflicting with the Holy 
Scripture were rejected and condemned].
I. Original Sin.
STATUS CONTROVERSIAE.
The Principal Question in This Controversy.
1] Whether original sin is properly and without any distinction man’s corrupt 
nature, substance, and essence, or at any rate the principal and best part of his es-
sence [substance], namely, the rational soul itself in its highest state and powers; or 
whether, even after the Fall, there is a distinction between man’s substance, nature, 
essence, body, soul, and original sin, so that the nature [itself] is one thing, and 
original sin, which inheres in the corrupt nature and corrupts the nature, another.
Affirmative Theses. The Pure Doctrine, Faith, and Confession ac-
cording to the Aforesaid Standard and Summary Declaration.
2] 1. We believe, teach, and confess that there is a distinction between man’s nature, 
not only as he was originally created by God pure and holy and without sin, but 
also as we have it [that nature] now after the Fall, namely, between the nature 
[itself], which even after the Fall is and remains a creature of God, and original sin, 
and that this distinction is as great as the distinction between a work of God and a 
work of the devil.
The Lutheran Confessions
436
3] 2. We believe, teach, and confess also that this distinction should be maintained 
with the greatest care, because this doctrine, that no distinction is to be made 
between our corrupt human nature and original sin, conflicts with the chief 
articles of our Christian faith concerning creation, redemption, sanctification, and 
the resurrection of our body, and cannot coexist therewith.
4] For God created not only the body and soul of Adam and Eve before the Fall, 
but also our bodies and souls after the Fall, notwithstanding that they are corrupt, 
which God also still acknowledges as His work, as it is written Job 10:8: Thine 
hands have made me and fashioned me together round about. Deut. 32:18; Is. 45:9ff; 
54:5; 64:8; Acts 17:28; Job 10:8; Ps. 100:3; 139:14; Eccl. 12:1.
5] Moreover, the Son of God has assumed this human nature, however, without 
sin, and therefore not a foreign, but our own flesh, into the unity of His person, 
and according to it is become our true Brother. Heb. 2:14: Forasmuch, then, as the 
children were partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of 
the same. Again, 16; 4:15: He took not on Him the nature of angels, but He took on 
Him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behooved Him to be made 
like unto His brethren, yet without sin. 6] In like manner Christ has also redeemed 
it as His work, sanctifies it as His work, raises it from the dead, and gloriously 
adorns it as His work. But original sin He has not created, assumed, redeemed, 
sanctified; nor will He raise it, will neither adorn nor save it in the elect, but in the 
[blessed] resurrection it will be entirely destroyed.
7] Hence the distinction between the corrupt nature and the corruption which 
infects the nature and by which the nature became corrupt, can easily be discerned.
8] 3. But, on the other hand, we believe, teach, and confess that original sin is not a 
slight, but so deep a corruption of human nature that nothing healthy or uncor-
rupt has remained in man’s body or soul, in his inner or outward powers, but, as 
the Church sings:
Through Adam’s fall is all corrupt, Nature and essence human.
9] This damage is unspeakable, and cannot be discerned by reason, but only from 
God’s Word. 10] And [we affirm] that no one but God alone can separate from one 
another the nature and this corruption of the nature, which will fully come to pass 
through death, in the [blessed] resurrection, where our nature which we now bear 
will rise and live eternally without original sin and separated and sundered from 
it, as it is written Job 19:26: I shall be compassed again with this my skin, and in my 
flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold.
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
437
Negative Theses. Rejection of the False Opposite Dogmas.
11] 1. Therefore we reject and condemn the teaching that original sin is only a 
reatus or debt on account of what has been committed by another [diverted to us] 
without any corruption of our nature.
12] 2. Also, that evil lusts are not sin, but con-created, essential properties of the 
nature, or, as though the above-mentioned defect and damage were not truly sin, 
because of which man without Christ [not ingrafted into Christ] would be a child 
of wrath.
13] 3. We likewise reject the Pelagian error, by which it is alleged that man’s nature 
even after the Fall is incorrupt, and especially with respect to spiritual things has 
remained entirely good and pure in naturalibus, i. e., in its natural powers.
14] 4. Also, that original sin is only a slight, insignificant spot on the outside, 
dashed upon the nature, or a blemish that has been blown upon it, beneath which 
[nevertheless] the nature has retained its good powers even in spiritual things.
15] 5. Also, that original sin is only an external impediment to the good spiritual 
powers, and not a despoliation or want of the same, as when a magnet is smeared 
with garlic-juice, its natural power is not thereby removed, but only impeded; or 
that this stain can be easily wiped away like a spot from the face or pigment from 
the wall.
16] 6. Also, that in man the human nature and essence are not entirely corrupt, 
but that man still has something good in him, even in spiritual things, namely, 
capacity, skill, aptness, or ability in spiritual things to begin, to work, or to help 
working for something [good].
17] 7. On the other hand, we also reject the false dogma of the Manicheans, when 
it is taught that original sin, as something essential and self-subsisting, has been 
infused by Satan into the nature, and intermingled with it, as poison and wine are 
mixed.
18] 8. Also, that not the natural man, but something else and extraneous to man, 
sins, on account of which not the nature, but only original sin in the nature, is 
accused.
19] 9. We reject and condemn also as a Manichean error the doctrine that original 
sin is properly and without any distinction the substance, nature, and essence itself 
The Lutheran Confessions
438
of the corrupt man, so that a distinction between the corrupt nature, as such, after 
the Fall and original sin should not even be conceived of, nor that they could be 
distinguished from one another [even] in thought.
20] 10. Now, this original sin is called by Dr. Luther nature-sin, person-sin, essential 
sin, not because the nature, person, or essence of man is, without any distinction, 
itself original sin, but in order to indicate by such words the distinction between 
original sin, which inheres in human nature, and other sins, which are called actual 
sins.
21] 11. For original sin is not a sin which is committed, but it inheres in the nature, 
substance, and essence of man, so that, though no wicked thought ever should arise 
in the heart of corrupt man, no idle word were spoken, no wicked deed were done, 
yet the nature is nevertheless corrupted through original sin, which is born in us 
by reason of the sinful seed, and is a fountainhead of all other actual sins, as wicked 
thoughts, words, and works, as it is written Matt. 15:19: Out of the heart proceed 
evil thoughts. Also Gen. 6:5; 8:21: The imagination of man’s heart is evil from his 
youth.
22] 12. Thus there is also to be noted well the diverse signification of the word 
nature, whereby the Manicheans cover their error and lead astray many simple 
men. For sometimes it means the essence [the very substance] of man, as when it is 
said: God created human nature. But at other times it means the disposition and 
the vicious quality [disposition, condition, defect, or vice] of a thing, which inheres 
in the nature or essence, as when it is said: The nature of the serpent is to bite, 
and the nature and disposition of man is to sin, and is sin; here the word nature 
does not mean the substance of man, but something that inheres in the nature or 
substance.
23] 13. But as to the Latin terms substantia and accidens, because they are not words 
of Holy Scripture, and besides unknown to the ordinary man, they should not be 
used in sermons before ordinary, uninstructed people, but simple people should be 
spared them.
24] But in the schools, among the learned, these words are rightly retained in 
disputations concerning original sin, because they are well known and used 
without any misunderstanding, to distinguish exactly between the essence of a 
thing and what attaches to it in an accidental way.
25] For the distinction between God’s work and that of the devil is thereby desig-
nated in the clearest way, because the devil can create no substance, but can only, 
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
439
in an accidental way, by the providence of God [God permitting], corrupt the 
substance created by God.
II. Free Will.
STATUS CONTROVERSIAE. 
The Principal Question in This Controversy.
1] Since the will of man is found in four unlike states, namely: 1. before the Fall; 2. 
since the Fall; 3. after regeneration; 4. after the resurrection of the body, the chief 
question is only concerning the will and ability of man in the second state, namely, 
what powers in spiritual things he has of himself after the fall of our first parents 
and before regeneration, and whether he is able by his own powers, prior to and 
before his regeneration by God’s Spirit, to dispose and prepare himself for God’s 
grace, and to accept [and apprehend], or not, the grace offered through the Holy 
Ghost in the Word and holy [divinely instituted] Sacraments.
Affirmative Theses. The Pure Doctrine concerning This Article, 
according to God’s Word.
2] 1. Concerning this subject, our doctrine, faith, and confession is, that in spiritual 
things the understanding and reason of man are [altogether] blind, and by their 
own powers understand nothing, as it is written 1 Cor. 2:14: The natural man re-
ceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; neither 
can he know them when he is examined concerning spiritual things.
3] 2. Likewise we believe, teach, and confess that the unregenerate will of man is 
not only turned away from God, but also has become an enemy of God, so that it 
only has an inclination and desire for that which is evil and contrary to God, as 
it is written Gen. 8:21: The imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth. Also 
Rom. 8:7: The carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the Law 
of God, neither, indeed, can be. Yea, as little as a dead body can quicken itself to 
bodily, earthly life, so little can man, who by sin is spiritually dead, raise himself 
to spiritual life, as it is written Eph. 2:5: Even when we were dead in sins, He hath 
quickened us together with Christ; 2 Cor. 3:5: Not that we are sufficient of our-
selves to think anything good as of ourselves, but that we are sufficient is of God.
The Lutheran Confessions
440
4] 3. God the Holy Ghost, however, does not effect conversion without means, but 
uses for this purpose the preaching and hearing of God’s Word, as it is written 
Rom. 1:16: The Gospel is the power of God 5] unto salvation to every one that belie-
veth. Also Rom. 10:17: Faith cometh by hearing of the Word of God. And it is God’s 
will that His Word should be heard, and that man’s ears should not be closed. Ps. 
95:8. With this Word the Holy Ghost is present, and opens hearts, so that they, as 
Lydia in Acts 16:14, are attentive to it, and are thus converted alone through the 
grace and power of the Holy Ghost, whose 6] work alone the conversion of man 
is. For without His grace, and if He do not grant the increase, our willing and run-
ning, our planting, sowing, and watering, all are nothing, as Christ says John 15:5: 
Without Me ye can do nothing. With these brief words He denies to the free will 
its powers, and ascribes everything to God’s grace, in order that no one may boast 
before God. 1 Cor. 1:29; 2 Cor. 12:5; Jer. 9:23.
Negative Theses. Contrary False Doctrine.
7] Accordingly, we reject and condemn all the following errors as contrary to the 
standard of God’s Word:
8] 1. The delirium [insane dogma] of philosophers who are called Stoics, as also of 
the Manicheans, who taught that everything that happens must so happen, and 
cannot happen otherwise, and that everything that man does, even in outward 
things, he does by compulsion, and that he is coerced to evil works and deeds, as 
inchastity, robbery, murder, theft, and the like.
9] 2. We reject also the error of the gross Pelagians, who taught that man by his 
own powers, without the grace of the Holy Ghost, can turn himself to God, believe 
the Gospel, be obedient from the heart to God’s Law, and thus merit the forgive-
ness of sins and eternal life.
10] 3. We reject also the error of the Semi-Pelagians, who teach that man by his 
own powers can make a beginning of his conversion, but without the grace of the 
Holy Ghost cannot complete it.
11] 4. Also, when it is taught that, although man by his free will before 
regeneration is too weak to make a beginning, and by his own powers to turn 
himself to God, and from the heart to be obedient to God, yet, if the Holy Ghost 
by the preaching of the Word has made a beginning, and therein offered His grace, 
then the will of man from its own natural powers can add something, though little 
and feebly, to this end, can help and cooperate, qualify and prepare itself for grace, 
and embrace and accept it, and believe the Gospel.
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
441
12] 5. Also, that man, after he has been born again, can perfectly observe and com-
pletely fulfil God’s Law, and that this fulfilling is our righteousness before God, by 
which we merit eternal life.
13] 6. Also, we reject and condemn the error of the Enthusiasts, who imagine that 
God without means, without the hearing of God’s Word, also without the use of 
the holy Sacraments, draws men to Himself, and enlightens, justifies, and saves 
them. (Enthusiasts we call those who expect the heavenly illumination of the Spirit 
[celestial revelations] without the preaching of God’s Word.)
14] 7. Also, that in conversion and regeneration God entirely exterminates the 
substance and essence of the old Adam, and especially the rational soul, and in 
conversion and regeneration creates a new essence of the soul out of nothing.
15] 8. Also, when the following expressions are employed without explanation, 
namely, that the will of man before, in, and after conversion resists the Holy 
Ghost, and that the Holy Ghost is given to those who resist Him intentionally and 
persistently; for, as Augustine says, in conversion God makes willing persons out of 
the unwilling and dwells in the willing.
16] As to the expressions of ancient and modern teachers of the Church, when it 
is said: Deus trahit, sed volentem trahit, i. e., God draws, but He draws the willing; 
likewise, Hominis voluntas in conversione non est otiosa, sed agit aliquid, i. e., In 
conversion the will of man is not idle, but also effects something, we maintain that, 
inasmuch as these expressions have been introduced for confirming [the false opin-
ion concerning] the powers of the natural free will in man’s conversion, against the 
doctrine of God’s grace, they do not conform to the form of sound doctrine, and 
therefore, when we speak of conversion to God, justly ought to be avoided.
17] But, on the other hand, it is correctly said that in conversion God, through the 
drawing of the Holy Ghost, makes out of stubborn and unwilling men willing ones, 
and that after such conversion in the daily exercise of repentance the regenerate 
will of man is not idle, but also cooperates in all the works of the Holy Ghost, 
which He performs through us.
18] 9. Also what Dr. Luther has written, namely, that man’s will in his conversion 
is pure passive, that is, that it does nothing whatever, is to be understood respectu 
divinae gratiae in accendendis novis motibus, that is, when God’s Spirit, through 
the Word heard or the use of the holy Sacraments, lays hold upon man’s will, and 
works [in man] the new birth and conversion. For when [after] the Holy Ghost has 
wrought and accomplished this, and man’s will has been changed and renewed by 
The Lutheran Confessions
442
His divine power and working alone, then the new will of man is an instrument 
and organ of God the Holy Ghost, so that he not only accepts grace, but also coop-
erates with the Holy Ghost in the works which follow.
19] Therefore, before the conversion of man there are only two efficient causes, 
namely, the Holy Ghost and the Word of God, as the instrument of the Holy 
Ghost, by which He works conversion. This Word man is [indeed] to hear; however, 
it is not by his own powers, but only through the grace and working of the Holy 
Ghost that he can yield faith to it and accept it.
III. The Righteousness of Faith Before God.
STATUS CONTROVERSIAE. 
The Principal Question In This Controversy.
1] Since it is unanimously confessed in our churches, in accordance with God’s 
Word and the sense of the Augsburg Confession, that we poor sinners are justified 
before God and saved alone by faith in Christ, and thus Christ alone is our 
Righteousness, who is true God and man, because in Him the divine and human 
natures are personally united with one another, Jer. 23:6; 1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Cor. 5:21, the 
question has arisen: According to which nature is Christ our Righteousness? and 
thus two contrary errors have arisen in some churches.
2] For the one side has held that Christ according to His divinity alone is our 
Righteousness, if He dwell in us by faith; contrasted with this divinity, dwelling 
in us by faith, the sins of all men must be regarded as a drop of water compared to 
the great ocean. Others, on the contrary, have held that Christ is our Righteousness 
before God according to the human nature alone.
Affirmative Theses. Pure Doctrine of the Christian Churches against 
Both Errors Just Mentioned.
3] 1. Against both the errors just recounted, we unanimously believe, teach, and 
confess that Christ is our Righteousness neither according to the divine nature 
alone nor according to the human nature alone, but that it is the entire Christ 
according to both natures, in His obedience alone, which as God and man He 
rendered to the Father even unto death, and thereby merited for us the forgiveness 
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
443
of sins and eternal life, as it is written: As by one man’s disobedience many were 
made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous, Rom. 5:19.
4] 2. Accordingly, we believe, teach, and confess that our righteousness before 
God is (this very thing], that God forgives us our sins out of pure grace, without 
any work, merit, or worthiness of ours preceding, present, or following, that He 
presents and imputes to us the righteousness of Christ’s obedience, on account of 
which righteousness we are received into grace by God, and regarded as righteous.
5] 3. We believe, teach, and confess that faith alone is the means and instrument 
whereby we lay hold of Christ, and thus in Christ of that righteousness which 
avails before God, for whose sake this faith is imputed to us for righteousness, 
Rom. 4:5.
6] 4. We believe, teach, and confess that this faith is not a bare knowledge of the 
history of Christ, but such a gift of God by which we come to the right knowledge 
of Christ as our Redeemer in the Word of the Gospel, and trust in Him that for the 
sake of His obedience alone we have, by grace, the forgiveness of sins, are regarded 
as holy and righteous before God the Father, and eternally saved.
7] 5. We believe, teach, and confess that according to the usage of Holy Scripture 
the word justify means in this article, to absolve, that is, to declare free from sins. 
Prov. 17:15: He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous, 
even they both are abomination to the Lord. Also Rom. 8:33: Who shall lay any-
thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.
8] And when, in place of this, the words regeneratio and vivificatio, that is, 
regeneration and vivification, are employed, as in the Apology, this is done in the 
same sense. By these terms, in other places, the renewal of man is understood, and 
distinguished from justification by faith.
9] 6. We believe, teach, and confess also that notwithstanding the fact that many 
weaknesses and defects cling to the true believers and truly regenerate, even to the 
grave, still they must not on that account doubt either their righteousness which 
has been imputed to them by faith, or the salvation of their souls, but must regard 
it as certain that for Christ’s sake, according to the promise and [immovable] Word 
of the holy Gospel, they have a gracious God.
10] 7. We believe, teach, and confess that for the preservation of the pure doctrine 
concerning the righteousness of faith before God it is necessary to urge with 
special diligence the particulae exclusivae, that is, the exclusive particles, i. e., the 
The Lutheran Confessions
444
following words of the holy Apostle Paul, by which the merit of Christ is entirely 
separated from our works, and the honor given to Christ alone, when the holy 
Apostle Paul writes: Of grace, without merit, without Law, without works, not of 
works. All these words together mean as much as that we are justified and saved 
alone by faith in Christ. Eph. 2:8; Rom. 1:17; 3:24; 4:3ff.; Gal. 3:11; Heb. 11.
11] 8. We believe, teach, and confess that, although the contrition that precedes, 
and the good works that follow, do not belong to the article of justification before 
God, yet one is not to imagine a faith of such a kind as can exist and abide with, 
and alongside of, a wicked intention to sin and to act against the conscience. But 
after man has been justified by faith, then a true living faith worketh by love, Gal. 
5:6, so that thus good works always follow justifying faith, and are surely found 
with it, if it be true and living; for it never is alone, but always has with it love and 
hope.
Antitheses: Contrary Doctrines Rejected.
12] Therefore we reject and condemn all the following errors:
13] 1. That Christ is our Righteousness according to His divine nature alone.
14] 2. That Christ is our Righteousness according to His human nature alone.
15] 3. That in the sayings of the prophets and apostles where the righteousness of 
faith is spoken of the words justify and to be justified are not to signify declaring 
or being declared free from sins, and obtaining the forgiveness of sins, but actually 
being made righteous before God, because of love infused by the Holy Ghost, 
virtues, and the works following them.
16] 4. That faith looks not only to the obedience of Christ, but to His divine 
nature, as it dwells and works in us, and that by this indwelling our sins are 
covered.
17] 5. That faith is such a trust in the obedience of Christ as can exist and remain 
in a man even when he has no genuine repentance, in whom also no love follows, 
but who persists in sins against his conscience.
18] 6. That not God Himself, but only the gifts of God, dwell in believers.
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
445
19] 7. That faith saves on this account, because by faith the renewal, which consists 
in love to God and one’s neighbor, is begun in us.
20] 8. That faith has the first place in justification, nevertheless also renewal and 
love belong to our righteousness before God in such a manner that they [renewal 
and love] are indeed not the chief cause of our righteousness, but that nevertheless 
our righteousness before God is not entire or perfect without this love and 
renewal.
21] 9. That believers are justified before God and saved jointly by the imputed 
righteousness of Christ and by the new obedience begun in them, or in part by the 
imputation of Christ’s righteousness, but in part also by the new obedience begun 
in them.
22] 10. That the promise of grace is made our own by faith in the heart, and by the 
confession which is made with the mouth, and by other virtues.
23] 11. That faith does not justify without good works; so that good works are 
necessarily required for righteousness, and without their presence man cannot be 
justified.
IV. Good Works.
STATUS CONTROVERSIAE. 
The Principal Question In the Controversy concerning Good Works.
1] Concerning the doctrine of good works two divisions have arisen in some 
churches:
2] 1. First, some theologians have become divided because of the following 
expressions, where the one side wrote: Good works are necessary for salvation. It 
is impossible to be saved without good works. Also: No one has ever been saved 
without good works. But the other side, on the contrary, wrote: Good works are 
injurious to salvation.
3] 2. Afterwards a schism arose also between some theologians with respect to 
the two words necessary and free, since the one side contended that the word 
necessary should not be employed concerning the new obedience, which, they say, 
The Lutheran Confessions
446
does not flow from necessity and coercion, but from a voluntary spirit. The other 
side insisted on the word necessary, because, they say, this obedience is not at our 
option, but regenerate men are obliged to render this obedience.
4] From this disputation concerning the terms a controversy afterwards occurred 
concerning the subject itself; for the one side contended that among Christians the 
Law should not be urged at all, but men should be exhorted to good works from 
the Holy Gospel alone; the other side contradicted this.
Affirmitive Theses. Pure Doctrine of the Christian Churches con-
cerning This Controversy.
5] For the thorough statement and decision of this controversy our doctrine, faith, 
and confession is:
6] 1. That good works certainly and without doubt follow true faith, if it is not a 
dead, but a living faith, as fruits of a good tree.
7] 2. We believe, teach, and confess also that good works should be entirely 
excluded, just as well in the question concerning salvation as in the article of 
justification before God, as the apostle testifies with clear words, when he writes 
as follows: Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom 
God imputeth righteousness without works, saying, Blessed is the man to whom 
the Lord will not impute sin, Rom. 4:6ff And again: By grace are ye saved through 
faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not of works, lest any man 
should boast, Eph. 2:8-9.
8] 3. We believe, teach, and confess also that all men, but those especially who are 
born again and renewed by the Holy Ghost, are bound to do good works.
9] 4. In this sense the words necessary, shall, and must are employed correctly 
and in a Christian manner also with respect to the regenerate, and in no way are 
contrary to the form of sound words and speech.
10] 5. Nevertheless, by the words mentioned, necessitas, necessarium, necessity 
and necessary, if they be employed concerning the regenerate, not coercion, but 
only due obedience is to be understood, which the truly believing, so far as they 
are regenerate, render not from coercion or the driving of the Law, but from a 
voluntary spirit; because they are no more under the Law, but under grace, Rom. 
6:14; 7:6; 8:14.
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
447
11] 6. Accordingly, we also believe, teach, and confess that when it is said: The 
regenerate do good works from a free spirit, this is not to be understood as though 
it is at the option of the regenerate man to do or to forbear doing good when he 
wishes, and that he can nevertheless retain faith if he intentionally perseveres in 
sins.
12] 7. Yet this is not to be understood otherwise than as the Lord Christ and His 
apostles themselves declare, namely, regarding the liberated spirit, that it does not 
do this from fear of punishment, like a servant, but from love of righteousness, like 
children, Rom. 8:15.
13] 8. Although this voluntariness [liberty of spirit] in the elect children of God is 
not perfect, but burdened with great weakness, as St. Paul complains concerning 
himself, Rom. 7:14-25; Gal. 5:17;
14] 9. Nevertheless, for the sake of the Lord Christ, the Lord does not impute this 
weakness to His elect, as it is written: There is therefore now no condemnation to 
them which are in Christ Jesus, Rom. 8:1.
15] 10. We believe, teach, and confess also that not works maintain faith and 
salvation in us, but the Spirit of God alone, through faith, of whose presence and 
indwelling good works are evidences.
Negative Theses. False Contrary Doctrine.
16] 1. Accordingly, we reject and condemn the following modes of speaking: when 
it is taught and written that good works are necessary to salvation; also, that no 
one ever has been saved without good works; also, that it is impossible to be saved 
without good works.
17] 2. We reject and condemn as offensive and detrimental to Christian discipline 
the bare expression, when it is said: Good works are injurious to salvation.
18] For especially in these last times it is no less needful to admonish men to 
Christian discipline [to the way of living aright and godly] and good works, and 
remind them how necessary it is that they exercise themselves in good works as a 
declaration of their faith and gratitude to God, than that the works be not mingled 
in the article of justification; because men may be damned by an Epicurean 
delusion concerning faith, as well as by papistic and Pharisaic confidence in their 
own works and merits.
The Lutheran Confessions
448
19] 3. We also reject and condemn the dogma that faith and the indwelling of the 
Holy Ghost are not lost by wilful sin, but that the saints and elect retain the Holy 
Ghost even though they fall into adultery and other sins and persist therein.
V. Law and Gospel
STATUS CONTROVERSIAE.
The Principal Question In This Controversy.
1] Whether the preaching of the Holy Gospel is properly not only a preaching of 
grace, which announces the forgiveness of sins, but also a preaching of repentance 
and reproof, rebuking unbelief, which, they say, is rebuked not in the Law, but 
alone through the Gospel.
Affirmative Theses. Pure Doctrine of God’s Word.
2] 1. We believe, teach, and confess that the distinction between the Law and the 
Gospel is to be maintained in the Church with great diligence as an especially 
brilliant light, by which, according to the admonition of St. Paul, the Word of God 
is rightly divided.
3] 2. We believe, teach, and confess that the Law is properly a divine doctrine, 
which teaches what is right and pleasing to God, and reproves everything that is 
sin and contrary to God’s will.
4] 3. For this reason, then, everything that reproves sin is, and belongs to, the 
preaching of the Law.
5] 4. But the Gospel is properly such a doctrine as teaches what man who has 
not observed the Law, and therefore is condemned by it, is to believe, namely, 
that Christ has expiated and made satisfaction for all sins, and has obtained and 
acquired for him, without any merit of his [no merit of the sinner intervening], 
forgiveness of sins, righteousness that avails before God, and eternal life.
6] 5. But since the term Gospel is not used in one and the same sense in the Holy 
Scriptures, on account of which this dissension originally arose, we believe, teach, 
and confess that if by the term Gospel is understood the entire doctrine of Christ 
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
449
which He proposed in His ministry, as also did His apostles (in which sense it is 
employed, Mark 1:15; Acts 20:21), it is correctly said and written that the Gospel is 
a preaching of repentance and of the forgiveness of sins.
7] 6. But if the Law and the Gospel, likewise also Moses himself [as] a teacher of 
the Law and Christ as a preacher of the Gospel are contrasted with one another, 
we believe, teach, and confess that the Gospel is not a preaching of repentance or 
reproof, but properly nothing else than a preaching of consolation, and a joyful 
message which does not reprove or terrify, but comforts consciences against the 
terrors of the Law, points alone to the merit of Christ, and raises them up again 
by the lovely preaching of the grace and favor of God, obtained through Christ’s 
merit.
8] 7. As to the revelation of sin, because the veil of Moses hangs before the eyes of 
all men as long as they hear the bare preaching of the Law, and nothing concerning 
Christ, and therefore do not learn from the Law to perceive their sins aright, but 
either become presumptuous hypocrites [who swell with the opinion of their own 
righteousness] as the Pharisees, or despair like Judas, Christ takes the Law into His 
hands, and explains it spiritually, Matt. 5:21ff ; Rom. 7:14. And thus the wrath of 
God is revealed from heaven against all sinners [ Rom. 1:18 ], how great it is; by this 
means they are directed [sent back] to the Law, and then first learn from it to know 
aright their sins-a knowledge which Moses never could have forced out of them.
9] Accordingly, although the preaching of the suffering and death of Christ, the 
Son of God, is an earnest and terrible proclamation and declaration of God’s 
wrath, whereby men are first led into the Law aright, after the veil of Moses has 
been removed from them, so that they first know aright how great things God in 
His Law requires of us, none of which we can observe, and therefore are to seek all 
our righteousness in Christ:
10] 8. Yet as long as all this (namely, Christ’s suffering and death) proclaims God’s 
wrath and terrifies man, it is still not properly the preaching of the Gospel, but the 
preaching of Moses and the Law, and therefore a foreign work of Christ, by which 
He arrives at His proper office, that is, to preach grace, console, and quicken, 
which is properly the preaching of the Gospel.
Negative Theses. Contrary Doctrine which is Rejected.
11] Accordingly we reject and regard as incorrect and injurious the dogma that the 
Gospel is properly a preaching of repentance or reproof, and not alone a preaching 
The Lutheran Confessions
450
of grace; for thereby the Gospel is again converted into a doctrine of the Law, 
the merit of Christ and Holy Scripture are obscured, Christians robbed of true 
consolation, and the door is opened again to [the errors and superstitions of] the 
Papacy.
VI. The Third Use of the Law.
STATUS CONTROVERSIAE. 
The Principal Question In This Controversy.
1] Since the Law was given to men for three reasons: first, that thereby outward 
discipline might be maintained against wild, disobedient men [and that wild and 
intractable men might be restrained, as though by certain bars]; secondly, that 
men thereby may be led to the knowledge of their sins; thirdly, that after they are 
regenerate and [much of] the flesh notwithstanding cleaves to them, they might 
on this account have a fixed rule according to which they are to regulate and 
direct their whole life, a dissension has occurred between some few theologians 
concerning the third use of the Law, namely, whether it is to be urged or not upon 
regenerate Christians. The one side has said, Yea; the other, Nay.
Affirmative Theses. The True Christian Doctrine concerning This 
Controversy.
2] 1. We believe, teach, and confess that, although men truly believing [in Christ] 
and truly converted to God have been freed and exempted from the curse and 
coercion of the Law, they nevertheless are not on this account without Law, 
but have been redeemed by the Son of God in order that they should exercise 
themselves in it day and night [that they should meditate upon God’s Law day and 
night, and constantly exercise themselves in its observance, Ps. 1:2 ], Ps. 119. For 
even our first parents before the Fall did not live without Law, who had the Law of 
God written also into their hearts, because they were created in the image of God, 
Gen. 1:26f.; 2:16ff; 3:3.
3] 2. We believe, teach, and confess that the preaching of the Law is to be urged 
with diligence, not only upon the unbelieving and impenitent, but also upon true 
believers, who are truly converted, regenerate, and justified by faith.
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
451
4] 3. For although they are regenerate and renewed in the spirit of their mind, yet 
in the present life this regeneration and renewal is not complete, but only begun, 
and believers are, by the spirit of their mind, in a constant struggle against the 
flesh, that is, against the corrupt nature and disposition which cleaves to us unto 
death. On account of this old Adam, which still inheres in the understanding, the 
will, and all the powers of man, it is needful that the Law of the Lord always shine 
before them, in order that they may not from human devotion institute wanton 
and self-elected cults [that they may frame nothing in a matter of religion from the 
desire of private devotion, and may not choose divine services not instituted by 
God’s Word]; likewise, that the old Adam also may not employ his own will, but 
may be subdued against his will, not only by the admonition and threatening of 
the Law, but also by punishments and blows, so that he may follow and surrender 
himself captive to the Spirit, 1 Cor. 9:27; Rom. 6:12, Gal. 6:14; Ps. 119:1ff ; Heb. 13:21 
(Heb. 12:1).
5] 4. Now, as regards the distinction between the works of the Law and the fruits of 
the Spirit, we believe, teach, and confess that the works which are done according 
to the Law are and are called works of the Law as long as they are only extorted 
from man by urging the punishment and threatening of God’s wrath.
6] 5. Fruits of the Spirit, however, are the works which the Spirit of God who 
dwells in believers works through the regenerate, and which are done by believers 
so far as they are regenerate [spontaneously and freely], as though they knew of 
no command, threat, or reward; for in this manner the children of God live in the 
Law and walk according to the Law of God, which [mode of living] St. Paul in his 
epistles calls the Law of Christ and the Law of the mind, Rom. 7:25; 8:7; Rom. 8:2; 
Gal. 6:2.
7] 6. Thus the Law is and remains both to the penitent and impenitent, both to 
regenerate and unregenerate men, one [and the same] Law, namely, the immutable 
will of God; and the difference, so far as concerns obedience, is alone in man, 
inasmuch as one who is not yet regenerate does for the Law out of constraint and 
unwillingly what it requires of him (as also the regenerate do according to the 
flesh); but the believer, so far as he is regenerate, does without constraint and with 
a willing spirit that which no threatenings [however severe] of the Law could ever 
extort from him.
The Lutheran Confessions
452
Negative Theses. False Contrary Doctrine.
8] Accordingly, we reject as a dogma and error injurious to, and conflicting with, 
Christian discipline and true godliness the teaching that the Law in the above-
mentioned way and degree is not to be urged upon Christians and true believers, 
but only upon unbelievers, non-Christians, and the impenitent.
VII. The Lord’s Supper.
1] Although the Zwinglian teachers are not to be reckoned among the theologians 
who affiliate with [acknowledge and profess] the Augsburg Confession, as they 
separated from them at the very time when this Confession was presented, 
nevertheless, since they are intruding themselves (into their assembly], and are 
attempting, under the name of this Christian Confession, to spread their error, we 
intend also to make a needful statement [we have judged that the Church of Christ 
should be instructed also] concerning this controversy.
STATUS CONTROVERSIAE. 
Chief Controversy between Our Doctrine and That of the Sacra-
mentarians regarding This Article.
2] Whether in the Holy Supper the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ 
are truly and essentially present, are distributed with the bread and wine, and 
received with the mouth by all those who use this Sacrament, whether they be 
worthy or unworthy, godly or ungodly, believing or unbelieving; by the believing 
for consolation and life, by the unbelieving for judgment? The Sacramentarians say, 
No; we say, Yes.
3] For the explanation of this controversy it is to be noted in the beginning that 
there are two kinds of Sacramentarians. Some are gross Sacramentarians, who 
declare in plain (deutschen), clear words as they believe in their hearts, that in the 
Holy Supper nothing but bread and wine is present, and distributed and received 
with the mouth. 4] Others, however, are subtle Sacramentarians, and the most 
injurious of all, who partly speak very speciously in our own words, and pretend 
that they also believe a true presence of the true, essential, living body and blood 
of Christ in the Holy Supper, however, that 5] this occurs spiritually through faith. 
Nevertheless they retain under these specious words precisely the former gross 
opinion, namely, that in the Holy Supper nothing is present and received with the 
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
453
mouth except bread and wine. For with them the word spiritually means nothing 
else than the Spirit of Christ or the power of the absent body of Christ and His 
merit, which is present; but the body of Christ is in no mode or way present, 
except only above in the highest heaven, to which we should elevate ourselves into 
heaven by the thoughts of our faith, and there, not at all, however, in the bread and 
wine of the Holy Supper, should seek this body and blood [of Christ].
Affirmative Theses. Confession of the Pure Doctrine concerning the 
Holy Supper against the Sacramentarians.
6] 1. We believe, teach, and confess that in the Holy Supper the body and blood of 
Christ are truly and essentially present, and are truly distributed and received with 
the bread and wine.
7] 2. We believe, teach, and confess that the words of the testament of Christ 
are not to be understood otherwise than as they read, according to the letter, so 
that the bread does not signify the absent body and the wine the absent blood of 
Christ, but that, on account of the sacramental union, they [the bread and wine] 
are truly the body and blood of Christ.
8] 3. Now, as to the consecration, we believe, teach, and confess that no work of 
man or recitation of the minister [of the church] produces this presence of the 
body and blood of Christ in the Holy Supper, but that this is to be ascribed only 
and alone to the almighty power of our Lord Jesus Christ.
9] 4. But at the same time we also believe, teach, and confess unanimously that in 
the use of the Holy Supper the words of the institution of Christ should in no way 
be omitted, but should be publicly recited, as it is written 1 Cor. 10:16: The cup 
of blessing which we bless, etc. This blessing occurs through the recitation of the 
words of Christ.
10] 5. The grounds, however, on which we stand against the Sacramentarians in 
this matter are those which Dr. Luther has laid down in his Large Confession 
concerning the Lord’s Supper.
The first is this article 11] of our Christian faith: Jesus Christ is true, essential, 
natural, perfect God and man in one person, undivided and inseparable.
12] The second: That God’s right hand is everywhere; at which Christ is placed in 
deed and in truth according to His human nature, [and therefore] being present, 
The Lutheran Confessions
454
rules, and has in His hands and beneath His feet everything that is in heaven and 
on earth [as Scripture says, Eph. 1:22 ], where no man else, nor angel, but only the 
Son of Mary is placed; hence He can do this [those things which we have said].
13] The third: That God’s Word is not false, and does not deceive.
14] The fourth: That God has and knows of various modes of being in any place, 
and not only the one [is not bound to the one] which philosophers call localis 
(local) for circumscribed].
15] 6. We believe, teach, and confess that the body and blood of Christ are received 
with the bread and wine, not only spiritually by faith, but also orally; yet not in 
a Capernaitic, but in a supernatural, heavenly mode, because of the sacramental 
union; as the words of Christ clearly show, when Christ gives direction to take, eat, 
and drink, as was also done by the apostles; for it is written Mark 14:23: And they 
all drank of it. St. Paul likewise says, 1 Cor. 10:16: The bread which we break, is it 
not the communion of the body of Christ? that is: He who eats this bread eats the 
body of Christ, which also the chief ancient teachers of the Church, Chrysostom, 
Cyprian, Leo I, Gregory, Ambrose, Augustine, unanimously testify.
16] 7. We believe, teach, and confess that not only the true believers [in Christ] 
and the worthy, but also the unworthy and unbelievers, receive the true body and 
blood of Christ; however, not for life and consolation, but for judgment and con-
demnation, if they are not converted and do not repent, 1 Cor. 11:27-29.
17] For although they thrust Christ from themselves as a Savior, yet they must 
admit Him even against their will as a strict Judge, who is just as present also to 
exercise and render judgment upon impenitent guests as He is present to work life 
and consolation in the hearts of the true believers and worthy guests.
18] 8. We believe, teach, and confess also that there is only one kind of unworthy 
guests, namely, those who do not believe, concerning whom it is written John 3:18: 
He that believeth not is condemned already. And this judgment becomes greater 
and more grievous, being aggravated, by the unworthy use of the Holy Supper, 1 
Cor. 11:29.
19] 9. We believe, teach, and confess that no true believer, as long as he retains 
living faith, however weak he may be, receives the Holy Supper to his judgment, 
which was instituted especially for Christians weak in faith, yet penitent, for the 
consolation and strengthening of their weak faith [Matt. 9:12; 11:5. 28].
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
455
20] 10. We believe, teach, and confess that all the worthiness of the guests of this 
heavenly feast is and consists in the most holy obedience and perfect merit of 
Christ alone, which we appropriate to ourselves by true faith, and whereof [of the 
application of this merit] we are assured by the Sacrament, and not at all in [but 
in nowise does this worthiness depend upon] our virtues or inward and outward 
preparations.
Negative Theses. Contrary, Condemned Doctrines of the Sacramen-
tarians.
21] On the other hand, we unanimously reject and condemn all the following 
erroneous articles, which are opposed and contrary to the doctrine presented 
above, the simple faith, and the [pure] confession concerning the Lord’s Supper;
22] 1. The papistic transubstantiation, when it is taught in the Papacy that in the 
Holy Supper the bread and wine lose their substance and natural essence, and are 
thus annihilated; that they are changed into the body of Christ, and the outward 
form alone remains.
23] 2. The papistic sacrifice of the Mass for the sins of the living and the dead.
24] 3. That [the sacrilege whereby] to laymen one form only of the Sacrament 
is given, and, contrary to the plain words of the testament of Christ, the cup is 
withheld from them, and they are [thus] deprived of His blood.
25] 4. When it is taught that the words of the testament of Christ must not be 
understood or believed simply as they read, but that they are obscure expressions, 
whose meaning must be sought first in other passages of Scripture.
26] 5. That in the Holy Supper the body of Christ is not received orally with the 
bread; but that with the mouth only bread and wine are received, the body of 
Christ, however, only spiritually by faith.
27] 6. That the bread and wine in the Holy Supper are nothing more than [symbols 
or] tokens by which Christians recognize one another.
28] 7. That the bread and wine are only figures, similitudes, and representations of 
the far absent body and blood of Christ.
29] 8. That the bread and wine are no more than a memorial, seal, and pledge, 
through which we are assured that when faith elevates itself to heaven, it there 
The Lutheran Confessions
456
becomes partaker of the body and blood of Christ as truly as we eat bread and 
drink wine in the Supper.
30] 9. That the assurance and confirmation of our faith [concerning salvation] in 
the Holy Supper occur through the external signs of bread and wine alone, and not 
through the true, [verily] present body and blood of Christ.
31] 10. That in the Holy Supper only the power, efficacy, and merit of the absent 
body and blood of Christ are distributed.
32] 11. That the body of Christ is so enclosed in heaven that it can in no way be at 
once and at one time in many or all places upon earth where His Holy Supper is 
celebrated.
33] 12. That Christ has not promised, neither could have effected, the essential 
presence of His body and blood in the Holy Supper, because the nature and 
property of His assumed human nature cannot suffer nor permit it.
34] 13. That God, according to [even by] all His omnipotence (which is dreadful to 
hear), is not able to cause His body to be essentially present in more than one place 
at one time.
35] 14. That not the omnipotent words of Christ’s testament, but faith, produces 
and makes [is the cause of] the presence of the body and blood of Christ in the 
Holy Supper.
36] 15. That believers must not seek the body [and blood] of Christ in the bread 
and wine of the Holy Supper, but raise their eyes from the bread to heaven and 
there seek the body of Christ.
37] 16. That unbelieving, impenitent Christians do not receive the true body and 
blood of Christ in the Holy Supper, but only bread and wine.
38] 17. That the worthiness of the guests at this heavenly meal consists not alone in 
true faith in Christ, but also in the external preparation of men.
39] 18. That even the true believers, who have and retain a true, living, pure faith 
in Christ, can receive this Sacrament to their judgment, because they are still 
imperfect in their outward life.
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
457
40] 19. That the external visible elements of the bread and wine should be adored 
in the Holy Sacrament.
41] 20. Likewise, we consign also to the just judgment of God all presumptuous, 
frivolous, blasphemous questions (which decency forbids to mention) and [other] 
expressions, which most blasphemously and with great offense [to the Church] are 
proposed by the Sacramentarians in a gross, carnal, Capernaitic way concerning 
the supernatural, heavenly mysteries of this Sacrament.
42] 21. Hence we hereby utterly [reject and] condemn the Capernaitic eating of 
the body of Christ, as though [we taught that] His flesh were rent with the teeth, 
and digested like other food, which the Sacramentarians, against the testimony of 
their conscience, after all our frequent protests, wilfully force upon us, and in this 
way make our doctrine odious to their hearers; and on the other hand, we maintain 
and believe, according to the simple words of the testament of Christ, the true, yet 
supernatural eating of the body of Christ, as also the drinking of His blood, which 
human senses and reason do not comprehend, but as in all other articles of faith 
our reason is brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, and this mystery is 
not apprehended otherwise than by faith alone, and revealed in the Word alone.
VIII. The Person of Christ.
1] From the controversy concerning the Holy Supper a disagreement has arisen 
between the pure theologians of the Augsburg Confession and the Calvinists, who 
also have confused some other theologians, concerning the person of Christ and 
the two natures in Christ and their properties.
STATUS CONTROVERSIAE. 
Chief Controversy In This Dissension.
2] The chief question, however, has been whether, because of the personal union, 
the divine and human natures, as also their properties, have realiter, that is, in deed 
and truth, a communion with one another in the person of Christ, and how far this 
communion extends.
3] The Sacramentarians have asserted that the divine and human natures in Christ 
are united personally in such a way that neither has realiter, that is, in deed and 
truth, in common with the other that which is peculiar to either nature, but that 
The Lutheran Confessions
458
they have in common nothing more than the name alone. For unio, they plainly 
say, facit communia nomina, i. e., the personal union makes nothing more than the 
names common, namely, that God is called man, and man God, yet in such a way 
that God has nothing realiter, that is, in deed and truth, in common with humani-
ty, and humanity nothing in common with divinity, its majesty and properties. Dr. 
Luther, and those who held with him, have contended for the contrary against the 
Sacramentarians.
Affirmative Theses. Pure Doctrine of the Christian Church concern-
ing the Person of Christ.
4] To explain this controversy, and settle it according to the guidance [analogy] of 
our Christian faith, our doctrine, faith, and confession is as follows:
5] 1. That the divine and human natures in Christ are personally united, so that 
there are not two Christs, one the Son of God, the other the Son of man, but that 
one and the same is the Son of God and Son of man, Luke 1:35; Rom. 9:5.
6] 2. We believe, teach, and confess that the divine and human natures are not 
mingled into one substance, nor the one changed into the other, but that each 
retains its own essential properties, which [can] never become the properties of the 
other nature.
7] 3. The properties of the divine nature are: to be almighty, eternal, infinite, and 
to be, according to the property of its nature and its natural essence, of itself, 
everywhere present, to know everything, etc.; which never become properties of 
the human nature.
8] 4. The properties of the human nature are: to be a corporeal creature, to be flesh 
and blood, to be finite and circumscribed, to suffer, to die, to ascend and descend, 
to move from one place to another, to suffer hunger, thirst, cold, heat, and the like; 
which never become properties of the divine nature.
9] 5. As the two natures are united personally, i. e., in one person, we believe, teach, 
and confess that this union is not such a copulation and connection that neither 
nature has anything in common with the other personally, i.e . because of the per-
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
459
sonal union, as when two boards are glued together, where neither gives anything 
to the other or takes anything from the other. But here is the highest communion, 
which God truly has with the [assumed] man, from which personal union, and 
the highest and ineffable communion resulting therefrom, there flows everything 
human that is said and believed concerning God, and everything divine that is said 
and believed concerning the man Christ; as the ancient teachers of the Church 
explained this union and communion of the natures by the illustration of iron 
glowing with fire, and also by the union of body and soul in man.
10] 6. Hence we believe, teach, and confess that God is man and man is God, which 
could not be if the divine and human natures had in deed and truth absolutely no 
communion with one another.
11] For how could the man, the son of Mary, in truth be called or be God, or the 
Son of God the Most High, if His humanity were not personally united with 
the Son of God, and He thus had realiter, that is, in deed and truth, nothing in 
common with Him except only the name of God?
12] 7. Hence we believe, teach, and confess that Mary conceived and bore not a 
mere man and no more, but the true Son of God; therefore she also is rightly called 
and truly is the mother of God.
13] 8. Hence we also believe, teach, and confess that it was not a mere man who 
suffered, died, was buried, descended to hell, arose from the dead, ascended into 
heaven, and was raised to the majesty and almighty power of God for us, but a man 
whose human nature has such a profound [close], ineffable union and communion 
with the Son of God that it is [has become] one person with Him.
14] 9. Therefore the Son of God truly suffered for us, however, according to the 
property of the human nature which He assumed into the unity of His divine 
person and made His own, so that He might be able to suffer and be our High 
Priest for our reconciliation with God, as it is written 1 Cor. 2:8: They have crucfied 
the Lord of glory. And Acts 20:28: We are purchased with God’s blood.
15] 10. Hence we believe, teach, and confess that the Son of Man is realiter, that is, 
in deed and truth, exalted according to His human nature to the right hand of the 
almighty majesty and power of God, because He [that man] was assumed into God 
when He was conceived of the Holy Ghost in His mother’s womb, and His human 
nature was personally united with the Son of the Highest.
The Lutheran Confessions
460
16] 11. This majesty He [Christ] always had according to the personal union, and 
yet He abstained from it in the state of His humiliation, and on this account truly 
increased in all wisdom and favor with God and men; therefore He exercised 
this majesty, not always, but when [as often as] it pleased Him, until after His 
resurrection He entirely laid aside the form of a servant, but not the [human] 
nature, and was established in the full use, manifestation, and declaration of the 
divine majesty, and thus entered into His glory, Phil. 2:6ff , so that now not only 
as God, but also as man He knows all things, can do all things, is present with all 
creatures, and has under His feet and in His hands everything that is in heaven 
and on earth and under the earth, as He Himself testifies Matt. 28:18; John 13:3: All 
power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. And St. Paul says Eph. 4:10: He as-
cended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things. And this His power, 
He, being present, can exercise everywhere, and to Him everything is possible and 
everything is known.
17] 12. Hence He also is able and it is very easy for Him to impart, as one who is 
present, His true body and blood in the Holy Supper, not according to the mode 
or property of the human nature, but according to the mode and property of 
the right hand of God, as Dr. Luther says in accordance with our Christian faith 
for children, which presence (of Christ in the Holy Supper] is not [physical or] 
earthly, nor Capernaitic; nevertheless it is true and substantial, as the words of His 
testament read: This is, is, is My body, etc.
18] By this our doctrine, faith, and confession the person of Christ is not divided, 
as it was by Nestorius, who denied the communicatio idiomatum, that is, the 
true communion of the properties of both natures in Christ, and thus divided the 
person, as Luther has explained in his book Concerning Councils. Neither are the 
natures together with their properties confounded with one another [or mingled] 
into one essence (as Eutyches erred); nor is the human nature in the person of 
Christ denied or annihilated; nor is either nature changed into the other; but 
Christ is and remains to all eternity God and man in one undivided person, which, 
next to the Holy Trinity, is, as the Apostle testifies, 1 Tim. 3:16, the highest mystery, 
upon which our only consolation, life, and salvation depends.
Negative Theses. Contrary False Doctrine concerning the Person of 
Christ.
19] Accordingly, we reject and condemn as contrary to God’s Word and our simple 
[pure] Christian faith all the following erroneous articles, when it is taught:
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
461
20] 1. That God and man in Christ are not one person, but that the Son of God is 
one, and the Son of Man another, as Nestorius raved.
21] 2. That the divine and human natures have been mingled with one another into 
one essence, and the human nature has been changed into the Deity, as Eutyches 
fanatically asserted.
22] 3. That Christ is not true, natural, and eternal God, as Arius held [blasphemed].
23] 4. That Christ did not have a true human nature [consisting] of body and soul, 
as Marcion imagined.
24] 5. Quod unio personalis faciat tantum communia nomina, that is, that the 
personal union renders only the names and titles common.
25] 6. That it is only phrasis et modus loquendi, that is, a phrase and mode of 
speaking, when it is said: God is man, man is God; since Divinity, as they say, has 
realiter, that is, in deed [and truth], nothing in common with the humanity, nor 
the humanity with the Deity.
26] 7. That there is merely communicatio [idiomatum] verbalis [without reality], 
that is, that it is nothing but words when it is said the Son of God died for the sins 
of the world; the Son of Man has become almighty.
27] 8. That the human nature in Christ has become an infinite essence in the same 
manner as the Divinity, and that it is everywhere present in the same manner as 
the divine nature because of this essential power and property, communicated to, 
and poured out into, the human nature and separated from God.
28] 9. That the human nature has become equal to and like the divine nature in its 
substance and essence, or in its essential properties.
29] 10. That the human nature of Christ is locally extended to all places of heaven 
and earth, which should not be ascribed even to the divine nature.
30] 11. That because of the property of the human nature it is impossible for Christ 
to be able to be at the same time in more than one place, much less everywhere, 
with His body.
31] 12. That only the mere humanity has suffered for us and redeemed us, and that 
the Son of God in the suffering had actually no communion with the humanity, as 
though it did not concern Him.
The Lutheran Confessions
462
32] 13. That Christ is present with us on earth in the Word, the Sacraments, and 
in all our troubles, only according to His divinity, and that this presence does not 
at all pertain to His human nature, according to which also, as they say, He, after 
having redeemed us by His suffering and death, has nothing to do with us any 
longer upon earth.
33] 14. That the Son of God who assumed the human nature, after He has laid 
aside the form of a servant, does not perform all the works of His omnipotence in, 
through, and with His human nature, but only some, and only in the place where 
His human nature is locally.
34] 15. That according to His human nature He is not at all capable of omnipotence 
and other attributes of the divine nature, against the express declaration of Christ, 
Matt. 28:18: All power is given unto He in heaven and in earth, and of St. Paul, Col. 
2:9: In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
35] 16. That to Him [to Christ according to His humanity] greater power is given 
in heaven and upon earth, namely, greater and more than to all angels and other 
creatures, but that He has no communion with the omnipotence of God, nor that 
this has been given Him. Hence they devise mediam potentiam, that is, a power 
between the almighty power of God and the power of other creatures given to 
Christ according to His humanity by the exaltation, such as would be less than 
God’s almighty power and greater than that of other creatures.
36] 17. That Christ according to His human mind has a certain limit as to how 
much He is to know, and that He knows no more than is becoming and needful for 
Him to know for [the execution of] His office as Judge.
37] 18. That Christ does not yet have a perfect knowledge of God and all His 
works; of whom nevertheless it is written Col. 2:3: In whom are hid all the treasures 
of wisdom and knowledge.
38] 19. That it is impossible for Christ according to His human mind to know what 
has been from eternity, what at present is occurring everywhere, and what will be 
in eternity.
39] 20. When it is taught, and the passage Matt. 28:18: All power is given unto Me, 
etc., is thus interpreted and blasphemously perverted, namely, that all power in 
heaven and on earth was restored, that is, delivered again to Christ according to 
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
463
the divine nature, at the resurrection and His ascension to heaven, as though He 
had also according to His divinity laid this aside and abandoned it in His state of 
humiliation. By this doctrine not only the words of the testament of Christ are per-
verted, but also the way is prepared for the accursed Arian heresy, so that finally 
the eternal deity of Christ is denied, and thus Christ, and with Him our salvation, 
are entirely lost if this false doctrine were not firmly contradicted from the immov-
able foundation of the divine Word and our simple Christian [catholic] faith.
IX. The Descent of Christ Into Hell.
STATUS CONTROVERSIAE. 
Chief Controversy concerning This Article.
1] It has also been disputed among some theologians who have subscribed to the 
Augsburg Confession concerning this article: When and in what manner the Lord 
Christ, according to our simple Christian faith, descended to hell: whether this 
was done before or after His death; also, whether it occurred according to the 
soul alone, or according to the divinity alone, or with body and soul, spiritually or 
bodily; also, whether this article belongs to the passion or to the glorious victory 
and triumph of Christ.
2] But since this article, as also the preceding, cannot be comprehended by the 
senses or by our reason, but must be grasped by faith alone, it is our unanimous 
opinion that there should be no disputation concerning it, but that it should be 
believed 3] and taught only in the simplest manner; according as Dr. Luther, of 
blessed memory, in his sermon at Torgau in the year 1533 has explained this article 
in an altogether Christian manner, separated from it all useless, unnecessary 
questions, and admonished all godly Christians to Christian simplicity of faith.
4] For it is sufficient that we know that Christ descended into hell, destroyed hell 
for all believers, and delivered them from the power of death and of the devil, from 
eternal condemnation and the jaws of hell. But how this occurred we should [not 
curiously investigate, but] reserve until the other world, where not only this point 
[mystery], but also still others will be revealed, which we here simply believe, and 
cannot comprehend with our blind reason.

X. Church Rites
Which are [Commonly] Called Adiaphora or Matters of Indifference.
1] Concerning ceremonies or church rites which are neither commanded nor 
forbidden in God’s Word, but have been introduced into the Church for the sake 
of good order and propriety, a dissension has also occurred among the theologians 
of the Augsburg Confession.
STATUS CONTROVERSIAE. 
Chief Controversy concerning This Article.
2] The chief question, however, has been, whether, in time of persecution and 
in case of confession, even if the enemies of the Gospel have not reached an 
agreement with us in doctrine, some abrogated ceremonies, which in themselves 
are matters of indifference and are neither commanded nor forbidden by God, may 
nevertheless, upon the pressure and demand of the adversaries, be reestablished 
without violence to conscience, and we may thus [rightly] have conformity with 
them in such ceremonies and adiaphora. To this the one side has said Yea, the 
other, Nay.
Affirmative Theses. The Correct and True Doctrine and Confession 
concerning This Article.
3] 1. For settling also this controversy we unanimously believe, teach, and confess 
that the ceremonies or church rites which are neither commanded nor forbidden 
in God’s Word, but have been instituted alone for the sake of propriety and good 
order, are in and of themselves no divine worship, nor even a part of it. Matt. 
15:9:In vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of 
men.
4] 2. We believe, teach, and confess that the congregation of God of every place 
and every time has the power, according to its circumstances, to change such 
ceremonies in such manner as may be most useful and edifying to the congregation 
of God.
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
465
5] 3. Nevertheless, that herein all frivolity and offense should be avoided, and 
special care should be taken to exercise forbearance towards the weak in faith. 1 
Cor. 8:9; Rom. 14:13.
6] 4. We believe, teach, and confess that in time of persecution, when a plain [and 
steadfast] confession is required of us, we should not yield to the enemies in regard 
to such adiaphora, as the apostle has written Gal. 5:1: Stand fast, therefore, in the 
liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again in the yoke 
of bondage. Also 2 Cor. 6:14: Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers, 
etc. For what concord hath light with darkness? Also Gal. 2:5: To whom we gave 
place, no, not for an hour, that the truth of the Gospel might remain with you. 
For in such a case it is no longer a question concerning adiaphora, but concerning 
the truth of the Gospel, concerning [preserving] Christian liberty, and concern-
ing sanctioning open idolatry, as also concerning the prevention of offense to the 
weak in the faith [how care should be taken lest idolatry be openly sanctioned and 
the weak in faith be offended]; in which we have nothing to concede, but should 
plainly confess and suffer on that account what God sends, and what He allows the 
enemies of His Word to inflict upon us.
7] 5. We believe, teach, and confess also that no Church should condemn another 
because one has less or more external ceremonies not commanded by God than the 
other, if otherwise there is agreement among them in doctrine and all its articles, 
as also in the right use of the holy Sacraments, according to the well-known saying: 
Dissonantia ieiunii non dissolvit consonantiam fidei, Disagreement in fasting does 
not destroy agreement in faith.
Negative Theses. False Doctrine concerning This Article.
8] Accordingly, we reject and condemn as wrong and contrary to God’s Word when 
it is taught:
9] 1. That human ordinances and institutions in the church should be regarded as 
in themselves a divine worship or part of it.
10] 2. When such ceremonies, ordinances, and institutions are violently forced 
upon the congregation of God as necessary, contrary to its Christian liberty which 
it has in external things.
11] 3. Also, that in time of persecution and public confession [when a clear 
confession is required] we may yield to the enemies of the Gospel in such 
The Lutheran Confessions
466
adiaphora and ceremonies, or may come to an agreement with them (which causes 
injury to the truth).
12] 4. Also, when these external ceremonies and adiaphora are abrogated in such 
a manner as though it were not free to the congregation of God to employ one or 
more [this or that] in Christian liberty, according to its circumstances, as may be 
most useful at any time to the Church [for edification].
XI. Election.
1] Concerning this article no public dissension has occurred among the theologians 
of the Augsburg Confession. But since it is a consolatory article, if treated 
properly, and lest offensive disputations concerning the same be instituted in the 
future, it is also explained in this writing.
Affirmative Theses. The Pure and True Doctrine concerning This 
Article.
2] 1. To begin with [First of all], the distinction between praescientia et 
praedestinatio, that is, between God’s foreknowledge and His eternal election, 
ought to be accurately observed.
3] 2. For the foreknowledge of God is nothing else than that God knows all things 
before they happen, as it is written Dan. 2:28: There is a God in heaven that 
revealeth secrets and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in 
the latter days.
4] 3. This foreknowledge extends alike over the godly and the wicked, but it is not 
the cause of evil, neither of sin, namely, of doing what is wrong (which originally 
arises from the devil and the wicked, perverse will of man), nor of their ruin [that 
men perish], for which they themselves are responsible [which they must ascribe 
to themselves]; but it only regulates it, and fixes a limit to it [how far it should 
progress and] how long it should last, and all this to the end that it should serve 
His elect for their salvation, notwithstanding that it is evil in itself.
5] 4. The predestination or eternal election of God, however, extends only over 
the godly, beloved children of God, being a cause of their salvation, which He also 
provides, as well as disposes what belongs thereto. Upon this [predestination of 
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
467
God] our salvation is founded so firmly that the gates of hell cannot overcome it. 
John 10:28; Matt. 16:18.
6] 5. This [predestination of God] is not to be investigated in the secret counsel of 
God, but to be sought in the Word of God, where it is also revealed.
7] 6. But the Word of God leads us to Christ, who is the Book of Life, in whom all 
are written and elected that are to be saved in eternity, as it is written Eph. 1:4: He 
hath chosen us in Him [Christ] before the foundation of the world.
8] 7. This Christ calls to Himself all sinners and promises them rest, and He is in 
earnest [seriously wills] that all men should come to Him and suffer themselves to 
be helped, to whom He offers Himself in His Word, and wishes them to hear it and 
not to stop their ears or [neglect and] despise the Word. Moreover, He promises 
the power and working of the Holy Ghost, and divine assistance for perseverance 
and eternal salvation [that we may remain steadfast in the faith and attain eternal 
salvation].
9] 8. Therefore we should judge concerning this our election to eternal life neither 
from reason nor from the Law of God, which lead us either into a reckless, 
dissolute, Epicurean life or into despair, and excite pernicious thoughts in the 
hearts of men, for they cannot, as long as they follow their reason, successfully 
refrain from thinking: If God has elected me to salvation, I cannot be condemned, 
no matter what I do; and again: If I am not elected to eternal life, it is of no avail 
what good I do; it is all [all my efforts are] in vain anyway.
10] 9. But it [the true judgment concerning predestination] must be learned alone 
from the holy Gospel concerning Christ, in which it is clearly testified that God 
hath concluded them all in unbelief, that He might have mercy upon all, and that 
He is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance 
and believe in the Lord Christ. Rom. 11:32; Ezek. 18:23; 33:11; 2 Pet. 3:9; 1 John 2:2.
11] 10. Whoever, now, is thus concerned about the revealed will of God, and 
proceeds according to the order which St. Paul has observed in the Epistle to the 
Romans, who first directs men to repentance, to knowledge of sins, to faith in 
Christ, to divine obedience, before he speaks of the mystery of the eternal election 
of God, to him this doctrine [concerning God’s predestination] is useful and conso-
latory.
12] 11. However, that many are called and few chosen, Matt. 22:14, does not mean 
that God is not willing to save everybody; but the reason is that they either do 
The Lutheran Confessions
468
not at all hear God’s Word, but wilfully despise it, stop their ears and harden their 
hearts, and in this manner foreclose the ordinary way to the Holy Ghost, so that 
He cannot perform His work in them, or, when they have heard it, make light of it 
again and do not heed it, for which [that they perish] not God or His election, but 
their wickedness, is responsible. [2 Pet. 2:1ff ; Luke 11:49. 52; Heb. 12:25f.]
13] 12. Thus far a Christian should occupy himself [in meditation] with the article 
concerning the eternal election of God, as it has been revealed in God’s Word, 
which presents to us Christ as the Book of Life, which He opens and reveals to us 
by the preaching of the holy Gospel, as it is written Rom. 8:30: Whom He did pre-
destinate, them He also called. In Him we are to seek the eternal election of the Fa-
ther, who has determined in His eternal divine counsel that He would save no one 
except those who know His Son Christ and truly believe on Him. Other thoughts 
are to be [entirely] banished [from the minds of the godly], as they proceed not 
from God, but from the suggestion of the Evil Foe, whereby he attempts to weaken 
or entirely to remove from us the glorious consolation which we have in this salu-
tary doctrine, namely, that we know [assuredly] that out of pure grace, without any 
merit of our own, we have been elected in Christ to eternal life, and that no one 
can pluck us out of His hand; as He has not only promised this gracious election 
with mere words, but has also certified it with an oath and sealed it with the holy 
Sacraments, which we can [ought to] call to mind in our most severe temptations, 
and take comfort in them, and therewith quench the fiery darts of the devil.
14] 13. Besides, we should use the greatest diligence to live according to the will of 
God, and, as St. Peter admonishes, 2 Pet. 1:10, make our calling sure, and especially 
adhere to [not recede a finger’s breadth from] the revealed Word: that can and will 
not fail us.
15] 14. By this brief explanation of the eternal election of God His glory is entirely 
and fully given to God, that out of pure mercy alone, without all merit of ours, He 
saves us according to the purpose of His will; besides, also, no cause is given any 
one for despondency or a vulgar, wild life [no opportunity is afforded either for 
those more severe agitations of mind and faintheartedness or for Epicureanism].
Negative Theses False Doctrine concerning This Article.
16] Accordingly, we believe and hold: When any teach the doctrine concerning the 
gracious election of God to eternal life in such a manner that troubled Christians 
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
469
cannot comfort themselves therewith, but are thereby led to despondency or 
despair, or the impenitent are strengthened in their wantonness, that such doctrine 
is treated [wickedly and erroneously] not according to the Word and will of God, 
but according to reason and the instigation of the cursed Satan. For, as the apostle 
testifies, Rom. 15:4, whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for 
our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, might have 
hope. Therefore we reject the following errors:
17] 1. As when it is taught that God is unwilling that all men repent and believe 
the Gospel.
18] 2. Also, that when God calls us to Himself, He is not in earnest that all men 
should come to Him.
19] 3. Also, that God is unwilling that every one should be saved, but that some, 
without regard to their sins, from the mere counsel, purpose, and will of God, are 
ordained to condemnation so that they cannot be saved.
20] 4. Also, that not only the mercy of God and the most holy merit of Christ, but 
also in us there is a cause of God’s election, on account of which God has elected us 
to everlasting life.
21] All these are blasphemous and dreadful erroneous doctrines, whereby all the 
comfort which they have in the holy Gospel and the use of the holy Sacraments is 
taken from Christians, and therefore should not be tolerated in the Church of God.
–––––
22] This is the brief and simple explanation of the controverted articles, which for 
a time have been debated and taught controversially among the theologians of the 
Augsburg Confession. Hence every simple Christian, according to the guidance of 
God’s Word and his simple Catechism, can perceive what is right or wrong, since 
not only the pure doctrine has been stated, but also the erroneous contrary doc-
trine has been repudiated and rejected, and thus the offensive divisions that have 
occurred are thoroughly settled [and decided].
23] May Almighty God and the Father of our Lord Jesus grant the grace of His 
Holy Ghost that we all may be one in Him, and constantly abide in this Christian 
unity, which is well pleasing to Him! Amen.

(XII.) Other Heresies and Sects Which Never Embraced the Augs-
burg Confession.
1] In order that such [heresies and sects] may not silently be ascribed to us, 
because, in the preceding explanation, we have made no mention of them, we 
intend at the end [of this writing] simply to enumerate the mere articles wherein 
they [the heretics of our time] err and teach contrary to our Christian faith and 
confession to which we have often referred.
Erroneous Articles of the Anabaptists.
2] The Anabaptists are divided among themselves into many factions, as one 
contends for more, another for less errors; however, they all in common propound 
[profess] such doctrine as is to be tolerated or allowed neither in the Church, nor 
in the commonwealth and secular government, nor in domestic life.
Articles that Cannot be Tolerated in the Church.
3] 1. That Christ did not assume His body and blood from the Virgin Mary, but 
brought them with Him from heaven.
4] 2. That Christ is not true God, but only [is superior to other saints, because He] 
has more gifts of the Holy Ghost than any other holy man.
5] 3. That our righteousness before God consists not in the sole merit of Christ 
alone, but in renewal, and hence in our own godliness [uprightness] in which we 
walk. This is based in great part upon one’s own special, self-chosen [and humanly 
devised] spirituality [holiness], and in fact is nothing else than a new sort of monk-
ery.
6] 4. That children who are not baptized are not sinners before God, but righteous 
and innocent, who in their innocency, because they have not yet attained their 
reason [the use of reason], are saved without Baptism (which, according to their 
assertion, they do not need). Therefore they reject the entire doctrine concerning 
original sin and what belongs to it.
7] 5. That children are not to be baptized until they have attained their reason [the 
use of reason], and can themselves confess their faith.
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
471
8] 6. That the children of Christians, because they have been born of Christian 
and believing parents, are holy and children of God even without and before 
Baptism; and for this reason they neither attach much importance to the baptism 
of children nor encourage it, contrary to the express words of God’s promise which 
pertains only to those who keep His covenant and do not despise it. Gen. 17:7ff
9] 7. That that is no true Christian congregation [church] in which sinners are still 
found.
10] 8. That no sermon is to be heard nor attended in those churches in which 
formerly papal masses have been celebrated and said.
11] 9. That one [a godly man] must not have anything to do with the ministers of 
the Church who preach the Gospel according to the Augsburg Confession, and 
rebuke the sermons and errors of the Anabaptists; also that he is neither to serve 
nor in any way to labor for them, but to flee from and shun them as perverters of 
God’s Word.
Articles that Cannot be Tolerated in the Government.
12] 1. That under the New Testament the magistracy is not an estate pleasing to 
God.
13] 2. That a Christian cannot with a good, inviolate conscience hold or discharge 
the office of magistrate.
14] 3. That a Christian cannot without injury to conscience use the office of the 
magistracy against the wicked in matters as they occur [matters so requiring], nor 
that subjects may invoke for their protection and defense the power which the 
magistrates possess and have received from God.
15] 4. That a Christian cannot with a good conscience take an oath, nor with 
an oath do homage [promise fidelity] to the hereditary prince of his country or 
sovereign.
16] 5. That under the New Testament magistrates cannot, without injury to 
conscience, inflict capital punishment upon malefactors.
The Lutheran Confessions
472
Articles that Cannot be Tolerated in Domestic Life.
17] 1. That a Christian cannot with a good conscience hold or possess property, but 
is in duty bound to devote it to the common treasury.
18] 2. That a Christian cannot with a good conscience be an innkeeper, merchant, 
or cutler [maker of arms].
19] 3. That the married may be divorced on account of [diverse] faith, and the one 
may abandon the other and be married to another person who is of his faith.
Erroneous Articles of the Schwenkfeldians.
20] 1. That all those have no true knowledge of Christ as reigning King of heaven 
who regard Christ according to the flesh as a creature.
21] 2. That the flesh of Christ by His exaltation has assumed all divine properties in 
such a manner that Christ as man is in might, power, majesty, and glory altogether, 
as regards degree and position of essence equal to the Father and to the Word, so 
that now there is only one essence, property, will, and glory of both natures in 
Christ, and that the flesh of Christ belongs to the essence of the Holy Trinity.
22] 3. That the ministry of the Church [ministry of the Word], the Word preached 
and heard, is not a means whereby God the Holy Ghost teaches men, and works 
in them the saving knowledge of Christ, conversion, repentance, faith, and new 
obedience.
23] 4. That the water of Baptism is not a means whereby God the Lord seals the 
adoption of sons and works regeneration.
24] 5. That bread and wine in the Holy Supper are not means through and by 
which Christ distributes His body and blood.
25] 6. That a Christian who is truly regenerated by God’s Spirit can perfectly ob-
serve and fulfil the Law of God in this life.
26] 7. That it is not a true Christian congregation [church] in which no public 
excommunication [some formal mode of excommunication] or no regular process 
of the ban [as it is commonly called] is observed.
Epitome of the Formula of Concord
473
27] 8. That the minister of the church who is not on his part truly renewed, 
regenerate, righteous, and godly cannot teach other men with profit or distribute 
genuine, true Sacraments.
Error of the New Arians.
28] That Christ is not true, essential, natural God, of one eternal, divine essence 
with God the Father and the Holy Ghost, but is only adorned with divine majesty 
inferior to and alongside of God the Father [is so adorned with divine majesty, 
with the Father, that He is inferior to the Father].
Error of the Anti-Trinitarians.
29] This is an entirely new sect, not heard of before in Christendom, [composed 
of those] who believe, teach, and confess that there is not one only, eternal, divine 
essence of the Father Son, and Holy Ghost, but as God the Father, Son, and 
Holy Ghost are three distinct persons, so each person has its essence distinct and 
separate from the other persons of the Godhead; and that nevertheless they are 
either [some think] all three of equal power, wisdom, majesty, and glory, just as 
otherwise three men are distinct and separate from one another in their essence, or 
[others think that these three persons and essences are] unequal with one another 
in essence and properties, so that the Father alone is properly and truly God.
30] These and similar articles, one and all, with whatever other errors depend upon 
and follow from them, we reject and condemn as wrong, false, heretical, contrary 
to the Word of God, the three Creeds, the Augsburg Confession and Apology, the 
Smalcald Articles, and Luther’s Catechisms, against which all godly Christians of 
both high and low station are to be on their guard as they love the welfare and 
salvation of their souls.
31] That this is the doctrine, faith, and confession of us all, for which we will 
answer at the last day before the just Judge, our Lord Jesus Christ, and will neither 
secretly nor publicly speak or write anything against it, but that we intend by the 
grace of God to persevere therein, we have after mature deliberation testified, in 
the true fear of God and invocation of His name, by signing with our own hands 
[this Epitome].

The Solid Declaration of the Formula of 
Concord
Preface
1] When, by the special grace and mercy of the Almighty, the doctrine concerning 
the chief articles of our Christian religion (which under the Papacy had been 
horribly obscured by human teachings and ordinances) had been explained and 
purified again from [in accordance with the direction and analogy of] God’s 
Word by Dr. Luther, of blessed and holy memory, and the papistic errors, abuses, 
and idolatries had been rebuked; 2] and this pure reformation was nevertheless 
regarded by its opponents as [introducing] a new doctrine and was violently 
(though without foundation) charged with being entirely contrary to God’s Word 
and the Christian ordinances, and, in addition, was loaded with [almost endless] 
unsupportable calumnies and accusations, 3] the Christian [the most illustrious 
and in religious piety most prominent] Electors and Princes, and the Estates 
[of the Empire] which at that time had embraced the pure doctrine of the Holy 
Gospel and had their churches reformed in a Christian manner according to God’s 
Word, had a Christian Confession prepared from God’s Word at the great Diet 
of Augsburg in the year 1530 and delivered it to the Emperor Charles V. In this 
they clearly and plainly made their Christian confession as to what was being held 
and taught in the Christian evangelical churches concerning the chief articles, 
especially those in controversy between them and the Papists; and although this 
Confession was received with disfavor by their opponents, still, thank God, it 
remains to this day unrefuted and unoverthrown. 4] To this Christian [pious] 
Augsburg Confession, so thoroughly grounded in God’s Word, we herewith pledge 
ourselves again [publicly and solemnly] from our inmost hearts; we abide by its 
simple, clear, and unadulterated meaning as the words convey it, and regard the 
said Confession as a pure Christian symbol, with which at the present time true 
Christians ought to be found next to [which pious hearts ought to receive next to 
the matchless authority of] God’s Word; just as in former times concerning certain 
great controversies that had arisen in the Church of God, symbols and confes-
sions were proposed, to which the pure teachers and hearers at that time pledged 
themselves with heart and mouth. 5] We intend also, by the grace of the Almighty, 
faithfully to abide until our end by [the doctrine of] this Christian Confession, 
mentioned several times, as it was delivered in the year 1530 to the Emperor 
Charles V; and it is our purpose, neither in this nor in any other writing, to 
recede in the least from that oft-cited Confession, nor to propose another or new 
confession. 6] Now, although the Christian doctrine of this Confession has in great 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
475
part remained unchallenged (save what has been done by the Papists), yet it cannot 
be denied that some theologians have departed from some great [principal] and 
important articles of the said Confession, and either have not attained to their true 
meaning, or at any rate have not continued steadfastly therein, and occasionally 
[some] have even undertaken to attach to it a foreign meaning, while at the same 
time they wished to be regarded as adherents of [they professed to embrace] the 
Augsburg Confession, and to avail themselves and make their boast of it [for a 
pretext]. 7] From this, grievous and injurious dissensions have arisen in the pure 
evangelical churches; just as even during the lives of the holy apostles among those 
who wished to be called Christians, and boasted of Christ’s doctrine, horrible 
errors arose likewise. For some sought to be justified and saved by the works of the 
Law, Acts 15, 1-29, others denied the resurrection of the dead, 1 Cor. 15, 12, and still 
others did not believe that Christ was true and eternal God. Against these the holy 
apostles had to inveigh strenuously in their sermons and writings, although [they 
were well aware that] also at that time such fundamental errors and severe contro-
versies could not occur without offense both to unbelievers and to those weak in 
the faith. 8] In a similar manner at present our opponents, the Papists, rejoice at 
the dissensions that have arisen among us, in the unchristian and vain hope that 
these discords might finally cause the suppression of the pure doctrine, while those 
who are weak in faith are [greatly] offended [and disturbed], and some of them 
doubt whether, amid such dissensions, the pure doctrine is with us, and others 
do not know with whom to side with respect to the articles in controversy. 9] For 
the controversies which have occurred are not, as some would regard them, mere 
misunderstandings or disputes concerning words [as are apt to occur], one side not 
having sufficiently grasped the meaning of the other, and the difficulty lying thus 
in a few words which are not of great moment; but here the subjects of controversy 
are important and great, and of such a nature that the opinion of the party in error 
cannot be tolerated in the Church of God, much less be excused or defended. 10] 
Necessity, therefore, requires us to explain these controverted articles according to 
God’s Word and approved writings, so that every one who has Christian under-
standing can notice which opinion concerning the matters in controversy accords 
with God’s Word and the Christian Augsburg Confession, and which does not. 
And sincere Christians who have the truth at heart may guard and protect them-
selves against [flee and avoid] the errors and corruptions that have arisen.

The Comprehensive Summary, Foundation, 
Rule and Norm
Whereby All Dogmas should be Judged according to God’s Word, 
and the Controversies that have Occurred should be Explained and 
Decided in a Christian Manner.
1] Since for thorough, permanent unity in the Church it is, above all things, 
necessary that we have a comprehensive, unanimously approved summary and 
form wherein is brought together from God’s Word the common doctrine, reduced 
to a brief compass, which the churches that are of the true Christian religion 
confess, just as the ancient Church always had for this use its fixed symbols; 2] 
moreover, since this [comprehensive form of doctrine] should not be based on 
private writings, but on such books as have been composed, approved, and received 
in the name of the churches which pledge themselves to one doctrine and religion, 
we have declared to one another with heart and mouth that we will not make or 
receive a separate or new confession of our faith, but confess the public common 
writings which always and everywhere were held and used as such symbols or 
common confessions in all the churches of the Augsburg Confession before the 
dissensions arose among those who accept the Augsburg Confession, and as long 
as in all articles there was on all sides a unanimous adherence to [and mainte-
nance and use of] the pure doctrine of the divine Word, as the sainted Dr. Luther 
explained it.
3] 1. First [, then, we receive and embrace with our whole heart] the Prophetic and 
Apostolic Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the pure, clear fountain of 
Israel, which is the only true standard by which all teachers and doctrines are to be 
judged.
4] 2. And since of old the true Christian doctrine, in a pure, sound sense, was 
collected from God’s Word into brief articles or chapters against the corruption 
of heretics, we confess, in the second place, the three Ecumenical Creeds, namely, 
the Apostles’, the Nicene, and the Athanasian, as glorious confessions of the faith, 
brief, devout, and founded upon God’s Word, in which all the heresies which at 
that time had arisen in the Christian Church are clearly and unanswerably refuted.
5] 3. In the third place, since in these last times God, out of especial grace, has 
brought the truth of His Word to light again from the darkness of the Papacy 
through the faithful service of the precious man of God, Dr. Luther, and since this 
doctrine has been collected from, and according to, God’s Word into the articles 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
477
and chapters of the Augsburg Confession against the corruptions of the Papacy 
and also of other sects, we confess also the First, Unaltered Augsburg Confession 
as our symbol for this time, not because it was composed by our theologians, but 
because it has been taken from God’s Word and is founded firmly and well therein, 
precisely in the form in which it was committed to writing, in the year 1530, and 
presented to the Emperor Charles V at Augsburg by some Christian Electors, 
Princes, and Estates of the Roman Empire as a common confession of the reformed 
churches, whereby our reformed churches are distinguished from the Papists and 
other repudiated and condemned sects and heresies, after the custom and usage of 
the early Church, whereby succeeding councils, Christian bishops and teachers ap-
pealed to the Nicene Creed, and confessed it [publicly declared that they embraced 
it].
6] 4. In the fourth place, as regards the proper and true sense of the oft-quoted 
Augsburg Confession, an extensive Apology was composed and published in print 
in 1531, after the presentation of the Confession, in order that we might explain 
ourselves at greater length and guard against the [slanders of the] Papists, and 
that condemned errors might not steal into the Church of God under the name of 
the Augsburg Confession, or dare to seek cover under the same. We unanimously 
confess this also, because not only is the said Augsburg Confession explained as 
much as is necessary and guarded [against the slanders of the adversaries], but also 
proven [confirmed] by clear, irrefutable testimonies of Holy Scripture.
7] 5. In the fifth place, we also confess the Articles composed, approved, and 
received at Smalcald in the large assembly of theologians, in the year 1537, as they 
were first framed and printed in order to be delivered in the council at Mantua, or 
wherever it would be held, in the name of the Estates, Electors, and Princes, as an 
explanation of the above-mentioned Augsburg Confession, wherein by God’s grace 
they were resolved to abide. In them the doctrine of the Augsburg Confession is 
repeated, and some articles are explained at greater length from God’s Word, and, 
besides, the cause and grounds are indicated, as far as necessary, why we have aban-
doned the papistical errors and idolatries, and can have no fellowship with them, 
and also why we know, and can think of, no way for coming to any agreement with 
the Pope concerning them.
8] 6. And now, in the sixth place, because these highly important matters [the busi-
ness of religion] concern also the common people and laymen [as they are called], 
who, inasmuch as they are Christians, must for their salvation distinguish between 
pure and false doctrine, we confess also the Small and the Large Catechisms of 
Dr. Luther, as they were written by him and incorporated in his works, because 
they have been unanimously approved and received by all churches adhering to 
The Lutheran Confessions
478
the Augsburg Confession, and have been publicly used in churches, schools, and in 
[private] houses, and, moreover, because the Christian doctrine from God’s Word 
is comprised in them in the most correct and simple way, and, in like manner, is 
explained, as far as necessary [for simple laymen].
9] In the pure churches and schools these public common writings have been 
always regarded as the sum and model of the doctrine which Dr. Luther, of blessed 
memory, has admirably deduced from God’s Word, and firmly established against 
the Papacy and other sects; and to his full explanations in his doctrinal and po-
lemical writings we wish to appeal, in the manner and as far as Dr. Luther himself 
in the Latin preface to his published works has given necessary and Christian 
admonition concerning his writings, and has expressly drawn this distinction 
namely, that the Word of God alone should be and remain the only standard and 
rule of doctrine, to which the writings of no man should be regarded as equal, but 
to which everything should be subjected.
10] But [this is not to be understood as if] hereby other good, useful, pure books, 
expositions of the Holy Scriptures, refutations of errors, explanations of doctrinal 
articles, are not rejected; for as far as they are consistent with the above-mentioned 
type of doctrine, these are regarded as useful expositions and explanations, and 
can be used with advantage. But what has thus far been said concerning the 
summary of our Christian doctrine is intended to mean only this, that we should 
have a unanimously accepted, definite, common form of doctrine, which all our 
evangelical churches together and in common confess, from and according to 
which, because it has been derived from God’s Word, all other writings should be 
judged and adjusted as to how far they are to be approved and accepted.
11] For that we embodied the above-mentioned writing, namely, the Augsburg 
Confession, Apology, Smalcald Articles, Luther’s Large and Small Catechisms, in 
the oft-mentioned Sum of our Christian doctrine, was done for the reason that 
these have always and everywhere been regarded as the common, unanimously 
accepted meaning of our churches, and, moreover, have been subscribed at that 
time by the chief and most enlightened theologians, and have held sway in all 
evangelical churches and schools. 12] So also, as before mentioned, they were all 
written and sent forth before the divisions among the theologians of the Augsburg 
Confession arose; therefore, since they are held to be impartial, and neither can 
nor should be rejected by either part of those who have entered into controversy, 
and no one who without guile is an adherent of the Augsburg Confession will com-
plain of these writings, but will cheerfully accept and tolerate them as witnesses [of 
the truth], no one can think ill of [blame] us that we derive from them an explana-
tion and decision of the articles in controversy, 13] and that, as we lay down God’s 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
479
Word, the eternal truth, as the foundation, so we introduce and quote also these 
writings as a witness of the truth and as the unanimously received correct under-
standing of our predecessors who have steadfastly held to the pure doctrine.
Articles in Controversy with Respect to the Antithesis, or Opposite 
Doctrine.
14] Moreover, since for the preservation of pure doctrine and for thorough, 
permanent, godly unity in the Church it is necessary, not only that the pure, 
wholesome doctrine be rightly presented, but also that the opponents who teach 
otherwise be reproved, 1 Tim. 3 (2 Tim. 3:16); Titus 1:9, — for faithful shepherds, 
as Luther says, should do both, namely, feed or nourish the lambs and resist the 
wolves, so that the sheep may flee from strange voices, John 10:12, and may separate 
the precious from the vile, Jer. 15:19, —
15] Therefore we have thoroughly and clearly declared ourselves to one another, 
also regarding these matters, as follows: that a distinction should and must by 
all means be observed between unnecessary and useless wrangling, on the one 
hand, whereby the Church ought not to be disturbed, since it destroys more 
than it builds up, and necessary controversy, on the other hand, as, when such 
a controversy occurs as involves the articles of faith or the chief heads of the 
Christian doctrine, where for the defense of the truth the false opposite doctrine 
must be reproved.
16] Now, although the aforesaid writings afford the Christian reader, who delights 
in and has a love for the divine truth, clear and correct information concerning 
each and every controverted article of our Christian religion, as to what he should 
regard and receive as right and true according to God’s Word of the Prophetic 
and Apostolic Scriptures, and what he should reject, shun, and avoid as false and 
wrong; yet, in order that the truth may be preserved the more distinctly and clear-
ly, and be distinguished from all errors, and that nothing be hidden and concealed 
under ordinary terms [rather general words and phrases], we have clearly and ex-
pressly declared ourselves to one another concerning the chief and most important 
articles taken one by one, which at the present time have come into controversy, 
so that there might be a public, definite testimony, not only for those now living, 
but also for our posterity, what is and should remain the unanimous understanding 
and judgment [decision] of our churches in reference to the articles in controversy, 
namely:
The Lutheran Confessions
480
17] 1. First, that we reject and condemn all heresies and errors which were rejected 
and condemned in the primitive, ancient, orthodox Church, upon the true, firm 
ground of the holy divine Scriptures.
18] 2. Secondly, we reject and condemn all sects and heresies which are rejected in 
the writings, just mentioned, of the comprehensive summary of the Confession of 
our churches.
19] 3. Thirdly, since within thirty years some divisions arose among some 
theologians of the Augsburg Confession on account of the Interim and otherwise, 
it has been our purpose to state and declare plainly [categorically], purely, and 
clearly our faith and confession concerning each and every one of these in thesis 
and antithesis, i. e., the true doctrine and its opposite, in order that the foundation 
of divine truth might be manifest in all articles, and that all unlawful, doubtful, 
suspicious, and condemned doctrines, wherever and in whatever books they may 
be found, and whoever may have written them, or even now may be disposed 
to defend them, might be exposed [distinctly repudiated], 20] so that every one 
may be faithfully warned against the errors, which are spread here and there in 
the writings of some theologians, and no one be misled in this matter by the 
reputation [authority] of any man. From this declaration the Christian reader will 
inform himself in every emergency, and compare it with the writings enumerated 
above, and he will find out exactly that what was confessed in the beginning 
concerning each article in the comprehensive summary of our religion and faith, 
and what was afterward restated at various times, and is repeated by us in this 
document, is in no way contradictory, but the simple, immutable, permanent 
truth, and that we, therefore, do not change from one doctrine to another, as our 
adversaries falsely assert, but earnestly desire to be found loyal to the once-de-
livered Augsburg Confession and its unanimously accepted Christian sense, and 
through God’s grace to abide thereby firmly and constantly in opposition to all 
corruptions which have entered.
I. Original Sin
1] And, to begin with, a controversy has occurred among some theologians of the 
Augsburg Confession concerning Original Sin, what it properly [and really] is. For 
one side contended that, since through the fall of Adam man’s nature, and essence 
are entirely corrupt, the nature, substance, and essence of the corrupt, man, now, 
since the Fall, or, at any rate, the principal, highest part of his essence, namely, the 
rational soul in its highest state or principal powers is original sin itself, which has 
been called nature-sin or person-sin, for the reason that it is not a thought, word, 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
481
or work, but the nature itself whence, as from a root, spring all other sins, and that 
on this account there is now, since the Fall, because the nature is corrupt through 
sin, no difference whatever between the nature and essence of man and original 
sin.
2] But the other side taught, in opposition, that original sin is not properly the 
nature, substance, or essence of man, that is, man’s body or soul, which even now, 
since the Fall, are and remain the creation and creatures of God in us, but that it 
is something in the nature, body, and soul of man, and in all his powers, namely, 
a horrible, deep, inexpressible corruption of the same, so that man is destitute of 
the righteousness wherein he was originally created, and in spiritual things is dead 
to good and perverted to all evil; and that, because of this corruption and inborn 
sin, which inheres in the nature, all actual sins flow forth from the heart; and that 
hence a distinction must be maintained between the nature and essence of the 
corrupt man, or his body and soul, which are the creation and creatures of God in 
us even since the Fall, and original sin, which is a work of the devil, by which the 
nature has become corrupt.
3] Now this controversy concerning original sin is not unnecessary wrangling, 
but if this doctrine is rightly presented from, and according to, God’s Word, and 
separated from all Pelagian and Manichean errors, then (as the Apology says) the 
benefits of the Lord Christ and His precious merit, also the gracious operation 
of the Holy Ghost, are the better known and the more extolled; moreover, due 
honor is rendered to God, if His work and creation in man is rightly distinguished 
from the work of the devil, by which the nature has been corrupted. 4] In order, 
therefore, to explain this controversy in the Christian way and according to God’s 
Word, and to maintain the correct, pure doctrine of original sin, we shall collect 
from the above-mentioned writings the thesis and antithesis, that is, the correct 
doctrine and its opposite, into brief chapters.
5] 1. And first, it is true that Christians should regard and recognize as sin not 
only the actual transgression of God’s commandments; but also that the horrible, 
dreadful hereditary malady by which the entire nature is corrupted should above 
all things be regarded and recognized as sin indeed, yea, as the chief sin, which is 
a root and fountain-head of all actual sins. 6] And by Dr. Luther it is called a na-
ture-sin or person-sin, thereby to indicate that, even though a person would think, 
speak, or do nothing evil (which, however, is impossible in this life, since the fall of 
our first parents), his nature and person are nevertheless sinful, that is, thoroughly 
and utterly infected and corrupted before God by original sin, as by a spiritual lep-
rosy; and on account of this corruption and because of the fall of the first man the 
nature or person is accused or condemned by God’s Law, so that we are by nature 
The Lutheran Confessions
482
the children of wrath, death, and damnation, unless we are delivered therefrom by 
the merit of Christ.
7] 2. In the second place, this, too, is clear and true, as the Nineteenth Article of 
the Augsburg Confession teaches, that God is not a creator, author, or cause of sin, 
but by the instigation of the devil through one man sin (which is a work of the 
devil) has entered the world, Rom. 5, 12; 1 John 3, 7. And even at the present day, 
in this corruption [in this corruption of nature], God does not create and make 
sin in us, but with the nature which God at the present day still creates and makes 
in men original sin is propagated from sinful seed, through carnal conception and 
birth from father and mother.
8] 3. In the third place, what [and how great] this hereditary evil is no reason knows 
and understands, but, as the Smalcald Articles say, it must be learned and believed 
from the revelation of Scripture. And in the Apology this is briefly comprehended 
under the following main heads:
9] 1. That this hereditary evil is the guilt [by which it comes to pass] that, by reason 
of the disobedience of Adam and Eve, we are all in God’s displeasure, and by 
nature children of wrath, as the apostle shows Rom. 5:12ff ; Eph. 2:3.
10] 2. Secondly, that it is an entire want or lack of the concreated hereditary 
righteousness in Paradise, or of God’s image, according to which man was 
originally created in truth, holiness, and righteousness; and at the same time 
an inability and unfitness for all the things of God, or, as the Latin words read: 
Desciptio peccati originalis detrahit naturae non renovatae et dona et vim seu facultatem 
et actus inchoandi et efficiendi spiritualia; that is: The definition of original sin takes 
away from the unrenewed nature the gifts, the power, and all activity for beginning 
and effecting anything in spiritual things.
11] 3. That original sin (in human nature) is not only this entire absence of all 
good in spiritual, divine things, but that, instead of the lost image of God in man, 
it is at the same time also a deep, wicked, horrible, fathomless, inscrutable, and 
unspeakable corruption of the entire nature and all its powers, especially of the 
highest, principal powers of the soul in the understanding, heart, and will, so that 
now, since the Fall, man inherits an inborn wicked disposition and inward impurity of 
heart, evil lust and propensity; 12] that we all by disposition and nature inherit from 
Adam such a heart, feeling, and thought as are, according to their highest powers 
and the light of reason, naturally inclined and disposed directly contrary to God 
and His chief commandments, yea, that they are enmity against God, especially 
as regards divine and spiritual things. For in other respects, as regards natural, 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
483
external things which are subject to reason, man still has to a certain degree under-
standing, power, and ability, although very much weakened, all of which, however, 
has been so infected and contaminated by original sin that before God it is of no 
use.
13] 4. The punishment and penalty of original sin, which God has imposed upon 
the children of Adam and upon original sin, are death, eternal damnation, and 
also other bodily and spiritual, temporal and eternal miseries, and the tyranny 
and dominion of the devil, so that human nature is subject to the kingdom of the 
devil and has been surrendered to the power of the devil, and is held captive under 
his sway, who stupefies [fascinates] and leads astray many a great, learned man in 
the world by means of dreadful error, heresy, and other blindness, and otherwise 
rushes men into all sorts of crime.
14] 5. Fifthly, this hereditary evil is so great and horrible that only for the sake of 
the Lord Christ it can be covered and forgiven before God in the baptized and 
believing. Moreover, human nature, which is perverted and corrupted thereby, 
must and can be healed only by the regeneration and renewal of the Holy Ghost, 
which, however, is only begun in this life, but will not be perfect until in the life to 
come.
15] These points, which have been quoted here only in a summary way, are set 
forth more fully in the above-mentioned writings of the common confession of our 
Christian doctrine.
16] Now this doctrine must be so maintained and guarded that it may not deflect 
either to the Pelagian or the Manichean side. For this reason the contrary doctrine 
concerning this article, which is censured and rejected in our churches, should also 
be briefly stated.
17] 1. And first, in opposition to the old and the new Pelagians, the following false 
opinions and dogmas are censured and rejected, namely, that original sin is only 
a reatus or guilt, on account of what has been committed by another, without any 
corruption of our nature.
18] 2. Also, that sinful, evil lusts are not sins, but conditiones, or concreated and 
essential properties of the nature.
19] 3. Or as though the above-mentioned defect and evil were not properly and 
truly sin before God, on account of which man without Christ [unless he be 
The Lutheran Confessions
484
grafted into Christ and be delivered through Him] must be a child of wrath and 
damnation, also in the dominion and beneath the power of Satan.
20] 4. The following and similar Pelagian errors are also censured and rejected, 
namely: that nature, even since the Fall, is said to be incorrupt, and that especially 
with respect to spiritual things entirely good and pure, and in naturalibus, that is, in 
its natural powers, it is said to be perfect.
21] 5. Or that original sin is only external, a slight, insignificant spot sprinkled or a 
stain dashed upon the nature of man, or corruptio tantum accidentium aut qualitatum, 
i. e., a corruption only in some accidental things, along with and beneath which 
the nature nevertheless possesses and retains its integrity and power even in spiri-
tual things.
22] 6. Or that original sin is not a despoliation or deficiency, but only an external 
impediment to these spiritual good powers, as when a magnet is smeared with 
garlic-juice, whereby its natural power is not removed, but only hindered; or that 
this stain can be easily washed away, as a spot from the face or pigment from the 
wall.
23] 7. They are rebuked and rejected likewise who teach that the nature has indeed 
been greatly weakened and corrupted through the Fall, but that nevertheless it has 
not entirely lost all good with respect to divine, spiritual things, and that what 
is sung in our churches, Through Adam’s fall is all corrupt, Nature and essence human, 
is not true, but from natural birth it still has something good, small, little and 
inconsiderable though it be, namely, capacity, skill, aptness or ability to begin, to 
effect, or to help effect something in spiritual things. 24] For concerning external, 
temporal, worldly things and transactions, which are subject to reason, there will 
be an explanation in the succeeding article.
25] These and contrary doctrines of like kind are censured and rejected for the 
reason that God’s Word teaches that the corrupt nature, of and by itself, has no 
power for anything good in spiritual, divine things, not even for the least, as good 
thoughts; and not only this, but that of and by itself it can do nothing in the sight 
of God but sin, Gen. 6:5; 8:21.
26] In the same manner this doctrine must also be guarded on the other side 
against Manichean errors. Accordingly, the following and similar erroneous 
doctrines are rejected, namely: that now, since the Fall, human nature is in the 
beginning created pure and good, and that afterwards original sin from without is 
infused and mingled with the nature by Satan (as something essential), as poison is 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
485
mingled with wine [that in the beginning human nature was created by God pure 
and good, but that now, since the Fall, original sin, etc. ].
27] For although in Adam and Eve the nature was originally created pure, good, 
and holy, nevertheless sin did not enter their nature through the Fall in the way 
fanatically taught by the Manicheans, as though Satan had created or made some 
evil substance, and mingled it with their nature. But since man, by the seduction of 
Satan through the Fall, has lost his concreated hereditary righteousness according 
to God’s judgment and sentence, as a punishment, human nature, as has been said 
above, is so perverted and corrupted by this deprivation or deficiency, want, and 
injury, which has been caused by Satan, that at present the nature is transmitted, 
together with this defect and corruption [propagated in a hereditary way], to all 
men, who are conceived and born in a natural way from father and mother. 28] 
For since the Fall human nature is not at first created pure and good, and only 
afterward corrupted by original sin, but in the first moment of our conception the 
seed from which man is formed is sinful and corrupt. Moreover, original sin is not 
something by itself, existing independently in, or apart from, the nature of the cor-
rupt man, as it neither is the real essence, body, or soul of the corrupt man, or the 
man himself. 29] Nor can and should original sin and the nature of man corrupted 
thereby be so distinguished as though the nature were pure, good, holy, and uncor-
rupted before God, while original sin alone which dwells therein were evil.
30] Also, as Augustine writes concerning the Manicheans, as though it were not 
the corrupt man himself that sins by reason of inborn original sin, but something 
different and foreign in man, and that God, accordingly, accuses and condemns 
by the Law, not the nature as corrupt by sin, but only the original sin therein. For, 
as stated above in thesi, that is, in the explanation of the pure doctrine concerning 
original sin, the entire nature of man, which is born in the natural way of father 
and mother, is entirely and to the farthest extent corrupted and perverted by 
original sin, in body and soul, in all its powers, as regards and concerns the good-
ness, truth, holiness, and righteousness concreated with it in Paradise. Non tamen 
in aliam substantiam genere aut specie diversam, priori abolita, transmutata est, that is: 
Nevertheless the nature is not entirely exterminated or changed into another sub-
stance, which, according to its essence, could not be said to be like our nature [but 
is diverse in genus or species], and therefore cannot be of one essence with us.
31] Because of this corruption, too, the entire corrupt nature of man is accused and 
condemned by the Law, unless the sin is forgiven for Christ’s sake.
32] But the Law accuses and condemns our nature, not because we have been 
created men by God, but because we are sinful and wicked; not because and so far 
The Lutheran Confessions
486
as nature and its essence, even since the Fall, is a work and creature of God in us, 
but because and so far as it has been poisoned and corrupted by sin.
33] But although original sin, like a spiritual poison and leprosy (as Luther says), 
has poisoned and corrupted the whole human nature, so that we cannot show 
and point out to the eye the nature apart by itself, and original sin apart by itself, 
nevertheless the corrupt nature, or essence of the corrupt man, body and soul, or the 
man himself whom God has created (and in whom dwells original sin, which also 
corrupts the nature, essence, or the entire man), and original sin, which dwells in 
man’s nature or essence, and corrupts it, are not one thing; as also in external lepro-
sy the body which is leprous, and the leprosy on or in the body, are not, properly 
speaking, one thing. But a distinction must be maintained also between our nature 
as created and preserved by God, in which sin is indwelling, and original sin, which 
dwells in the nature. These two must and also can be considered, taught, and be-
lieved separately according to Holy Scripture.
34] Moreover, the chief articles of our Christian faith urge and compel us to 
preserve this distinction. For instance, in the first place, in the article of Creation, 
Scripture testifies that God has created human nature not only before the Fall, but 
that it is a creature and work of God also since the Fall, Deut. 32:6; Is. 45:11, 54:5, 
64:8; Acts 17:25; Rev. 4:11.
35] Thine hands, says Job, have made me and fashioned me together round about; 
yet Thou dost destroy me. Remember, I beseech Thee, that Thou hast made me as 
the clay; and wilt Thou bring me into dust again? Hast Thou not poured me out 
as milk and curdled me as cheese? Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and 
fenced me with bones and sinews. Thou hast granted me life and favor, and Thy 
visitation hath preserved my spirit. Job 10:8-12.
36] I will praise Thee, says David, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. 
Marvelous are Thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well. My substance was 
not hid from Thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest 
parts of the earth. Thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect, and in Thy 
book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned, when as 
yet there was none of them, Ps. 139:14-16.
37] In the Ecclesiastes of Solomon it is written: Then shall the dust return to the 
earth as it was, and the spirit to God, who gave it, Eccl. 12:7.
38] These passages clearly testify that God even since the Fall is the Creator of 
man, and creates his body and soul. Therefore corrupt man cannot, without any 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
487
distinction, be sin itself, otherwise God would be a creator of sin; as also our Small 
Catechism confesses in the explanation of the First Article, where it is written: I 
believe that God has made me and all creatures, that He has given me my body and soul, 
eyes, ears, and all my members, my reason and all my senses, and still preserves them. 
Likewise in the Large Catechism it is thus written: This is what I believe and mean, 
that is, that I am a creature of God; that He has given and constantly preserves to me my 
body, soul, and life, members great and small, and all my senses, mind, and reason. Nev-
ertheless, this same creature and work of God is lamentably corrupted by sin; for 
the mass (massa) from which God now forms and makes man was corrupted and 
perverted in Adam, and is thus transmitted by inheritance to us.
39] And here pious Christian hearts justly ought to consider the unspeakable 
goodness of God, that God does not immediately cast from Himself into hell-
fire this corrupt, perverted, sinful mass, but forms and makes from it the present 
human nature, which is lamentably corrupted by sin, in order that He may cleanse 
it from all sin, sanctify and save it by His dear Son.
40] From this article, now, the distinction is found indisputably and clearly. For 
original sin does not come from God. God is not a creator or author of sin. Nor is 
original sin a creature or work of God, but it is a work of the devil.
41] Now, if there were to be no difference whatever between the nature or essence 
of our body and soul, which is corrupted by original sin, and original sin, by which 
the nature is corrupted, it would follow either that God, because He is the Creator 
of this our nature, also created and made original sin, which, accordingly would 
also be His work and creature; or, because sin is a work of the devil, that Satan 
would be the creator of this our nature, of our body and soul, which would also 
have to be a work or creation of Satan if, without any distinction, our corrupt 
nature should have to be regarded as sin itself; both of which teachings are 
contrary to the article of our Christian faith. 42] Therefore, in order that God’s 
creation and work in man may be distinguished from the work of the devil, we say 
that it is God’s creation that man has body and soul; also, that it is God’s work that 
man can think, speak, do, and work anything; for in Him we live, and move, and 
have our being, Acts 17:28. But that the nature is corrupt, that its thoughts, words, 
and works are wicked, is originally a work of Satan, who has thus corrupted God’s 
work in Adam through sin, which from him is transmitted by inheritance to us.
43] Secondly, in the article of Redemption the Scriptures testify forcibly that 
God’s Son assumed our human nature without sin, so that He was in all things, sin 
excepted, made like unto us, His brethren, Heb. 2:14. Unde veteres dixerunt: Christum 
nobis, fratribus suis, consubstantialem esse secundum assumptam naturam, quia naturam, 
The Lutheran Confessions
488
quae, excepto peccato, eiusdem generis, speciei et substantiae cum nostra est, assumpsit; et 
contrariam sententiam manifeste haereseos damnarunt. That is: Hence all the old ortho-
dox teachers have maintained that Christ, according to His assumed humanity, is 
of one essence with us, His brethren; for He has assumed His human nature, which 
in all respects (sin alone excepted) is like our human nature in its essence and all 
essential attributes; and they have condemned the contrary doctrine as manifest 
heresy.
44] Now, if there were no distinction between the nature or essence of corrupt 
man and original sin, it must follow that Christ either did not assume our nature, 
because He did not assume sin, or that, because He assumed our nature, He also 
assumed sin; both of which ideas are contrary to the Scriptures. But inasmuch as 
the Son of God assumed our nature, and not original sin, it is clear from this fact 
that human nature, even since the Fall, and original sin, are not one [and the same] 
thing, but must be distinguished.
45] Thirdly, in the article of Sanctification Scripture testifies that God cleanses, 
washes, and sanctifies man from sin, 1 John 1:7, and that Christ saves His people 
from their sins, Matt. 1:21. Sin, therefore, cannot be man himself; for God receives 
man into grace for Christ’s sake, but to sin He remains hostile to eternity. There-
fore it is unchristian and horrible to hear that original sin is baptized in the name 
of the Holy Trinity, sanctified and saved, and other similar expressions found in 
the writings of the recent Manicheans, with which we will not offend simple-mind-
ed people.
46] Fourthly, in the article of the Resurrection Scripture testifies that precisely the 
substance of this our flesh, but without sin, will rise again, and that in eternal life 
we shall have and retain precisely this soul, but without sin.
47] Now, if there were no difference whatever between our corrupt body and soul 
and original sin, it would follow, contrary to this article of the Christian faith, 
either that this our flesh will not rise again at the last day, and that in eternal life 
we shall not have the present essence of our body and soul, but another substance 
(or another soul), because then we shall be without sin; or that [at the last day] sin 
also will rise again, and will be and remain in the elect in eternal life.
48] Hence it is clear that this doctrine [of the Manicheans] (with all that depends 
upon it and follows from it) must be rejected, when it is asserted and taught that 
original sin is the nature, substance, essence, body, or soul itself of corrupt man, so 
that between our corrupt nature, substance, and essence and original sin there is 
no distinction whatever. For the chief articles of our Christian faith forcibly and 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
489
emphatically testify why a distinction should and must be maintained between 
man’s nature or substance, which is corrupted by sin, and the sin, with which and 
by which man is corrupted. 49] For a simple statement of the doctrine and the 
contrary teaching (in thesi et antithesi) in this controversy, as regards the principal 
matter itself, is sufficient in this place, where the subject is not argued at length, 
but only the principal points are treated, article by article.
50] But as regards terms and expressions, it is best and safest to use and retain the 
form of sound words employed concerning this article in the Holy Scriptures and 
the above-mentioned books.
51] Also, to avoid strife about words, aequivocationes vocabulorum, that is, 
words and expressions which are applied and used in various meanings, should 
be carefully and distinctly explained; as when it is said: God creates the nature of 
men, there by the term nature the essence, body, and soul of men are understood. 
But often the disposition or vicious quality of a thing is called its nature, as when it 
is said: It is the nature of the serpent to bite and poison. Thus Luther says that sin 
and sinning are the disposition and nature of corrupt man.
52] Therefore original sin properly signifies the deep corruption of our nature, as 
it is described in the Smalcald Articles. But sometimes the concrete person or the 
subject, that is, man himself with body and soul, in which sin is and inheres, is also 
comprised under this term, for the reason that man is corrupted by sin, poisoned 
and sinful, as when Luther says: “Thy birth, thy nature, and thy entire essence is 
sin,” that is, sinful and unclean.
53] Luther himself explains that by nature-sin, person-sin, essential sin he means 
that not only the words, thoughts, and works are sin, but that the entire nature, 
person, and essence of man are altogether corrupted from the root by original sin.
54] However, as to the Latin words substantia and accidens, a church of plain 
people ought to be spared these terms in public sermons, because they are 
unknown to ordinary men. But when learned men among themselves, or with 
others to whom these words are not unknown, employ such terms in treating 
this subject, as Eusebius, Ambrose, and especially Augustine, and also still other 
eminent church-teachers have done, because they were necessary to explain this 
doctrine in opposition to the heretics, they assume immediatam divisionem, that 
is, a division between which there is no mean, so that everything that is must be 
either substantia, that is, a self-existent essence, or accidens, that is, an accidental 
matter which does not exist by itself essentially, but is in another self-existent 
essence and can be distinguished from it; which division Cyril and Basil also use.
The Lutheran Confessions
490
55] And since, among others, this, too, is an indubitable, indisputable axiom in 
theology, that every substantia or self-existing essence, so far as it is a substance, 
is either God Himself or a work and creation of God, Augustine, in many 
writings against the Manicheans, in common with all true teachers, has, after 
due consideration and with earnestness, condemned and rejected the statement: 
Peccatum originis est substantia vel natura, that is, original sin is man’s nature or 
substance. After him all the learned and intelligent also have always maintained 
that whatever does not exist by itself, nor is a part of another self-existing essence, 
but exists, subject to change, in another thing, is not a substantia, that is, some-
thing self-existing, but an accidens, that is, something accidental. Accordingly, 
Augustine is accustomed constantly to speak in this way: Original sin is not the 
nature itself, but an accidens vitium in natura, that is, an accidental defect and 
damage in the nature. 56] In this way, previous to this controversy, [learned] men 
spoke, also in our schools and churches, according to the rules of logic, freely and 
without being suspected [of heresy], and were never censured on this account 
either by Dr. Luther or any orthodox teacher of our pure, evangelical churches.
57] Now, then, since it is the indisputable truth that everything that is, is either 
a substance or an accidens, that is, either a self-existing essence or something 
accidental in it, as has just been shown and proved by testimonies of the church-
teachers, and no truly intelligent man has ever had any doubts concerning this, 
necessity here constrains, and no one can evade it, if the question be asked whether 
original sin is a substance, that is, such a thing as exists by itself, and is not in 
another or whether it is an accidens, that is, such a thing as does not exist by itself, 
but is in another, and cannot exist or be by itself, he must confess straight and pat 
that original sin is no substance, but an accidens.
58] For this reason, too, the Church of God will never be helped to permanent 
peace in this controversy, but the dissension will rather be strengthened and kept 
up, if the ministers of the Church remain in doubt as to whether original sin is a 
substance or an accidens, and whether it is rightly and properly named thus.
59] Hence, if the churches and schools are to be thoroughly relieved of this scan-
dalous and very mischievous controversy, it is necessary that each and every one be 
properly instructed concerning this matter.
60] But if it be further asked what kind of an accidens original sin is, that 
is another question, of which no philosopher, no papist, no sophist, yea, no 
human reason, however acute it may be, can give the right explanation, but 
all understanding and every explanation of it must be derived solely from the 
Holy Scriptures, which testify that original sin is an unspeakable evil and such 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
491
an entire corruption of human nature that in it and all its internal and external 
powers nothing pure or good remains, but everything is entirely corrupt, so that 
on account of original sin man is in God’s sight truly spiritually dead, with all his 
powers dead to that which is good.
61] In this way, then, original sin is not extenuated by the word accidens, [namely] 
when it is explained according to [the analogy of] God’s Word, after the manner in 
which Dr. Luther, in his Latin exposition of the third chapter of Genesis, has writ-
ten with great earnestness against the extenuation of original sin; but this word 
serves only to indicate the distinction between the work of God (which our nature 
is, notwithstanding that it is corrupt) and the work of the devil (which the sin is 
that inheres in God’s work, and is the most profound and indescribable corruption 
of it).
62] Therefore Luther also in his treatment of this subject has employed the term 
accidens, as also the term qualitas [quality], and has not rejected them; but at 
the same time he has, with special earnestness and great zeal, taken the greatest 
pains to explain and to inculcate upon each and every one what a horrible quality 
and accidens it is, by which human nature is not merely polluted, but so deeply 
corrupted that nothing pure or incorrupt has remained in it, as his words on Ps. 90 
run: Sive igitur peccatum originis qualitatem sive morbum vocaverimus, profecto 
extremum malum est non solum pati aeternam iram et mortem, sed ne agnoscere 
quidem, quae pateris. That is: Whether we call original sin a quality or a disease, it 
is indeed the utmost evil, that we are not only to suffer the eternal wrath of God 
and eternal death, but that we do not even understand what we suffer. And again, 
on Gen. 3: Qui isto veneno peccati originis a planta pedis usque ad verticem infecti 
sumus, siquidem in natura adhuc integra accidere. That is: We are infected with the 
poison of original sin from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head, inasmuch 
as this happened to us in a nature still perfect.
II. Free Will, or Human Powers
1] Since a division has occurred not only between the Papists and us, but also 
among some theologians of the Augsburg Confession themselves, concerning free 
will, we shall, first of all, show exactly the points in controversy.
2] For since man with [respect to] his free will is found and can be considered 
in four distinct, dissimilar states, the question at present is not what was the 
condition of the same before the Fall, or what he is able to do since the Fall and 
before his conversion in external things which pertain to this temporal life; 
The Lutheran Confessions
492
also not what sort of a free will he will have in spiritual things after he has been 
regenerated and is controlled by God’s Spirit, or when he rises from the dead. But 
the principal question is only and alone, what the intellect and will of the unregen-
erate man is able to do in his conversion and regeneration from his own powers 
remaining after the Fall; whether he is able, when the Word of God is preached, 
and the grace of God is offered us, to prepare himself for grace, accept the same, 
and assent thereto. This is the question upon which, for quite a number of years 
now, there has been a controversy among some theologians in the churches of the 
Augsburg Confession.
3] For the one side has held and taught that, although man cannot from his own 
powers fulfil God’s command, or truly trust in God, fear and love Him, without 
the grace of the Holy Ghost, nevertheless he still has so much of natural powers 
left before regeneration as to be able to prepare himself to a certain extent for 
grace, and to assent, although feebly; however, that he cannot accomplish anything 
by them, but must succumb in the struggle, if the grace of the Holy Ghost is not 
added thereto.
4] Moreover [On the other side], both the ancient and modern enthusiasts have 
taught that God converts men, and leads them to the saving knowledge of Christ 
through His Spirit, without any created means and instrument, that is, without the 
external preaching and hearing of God’s Word.
5] Against both these parties the pure teachers of the Augsburg Confession have 
taught and contended that by the fall of our first parents man was so corrupted 
that in divine things pertaining to our conversion and the salvation of our souls he 
is by nature blind, that, when the Word of God is preached, he neither does nor 
can understand it, but regards it as foolishness; also, that he does not of himself 
draw nigh to God, but is and remains an enemy of God, until he is converted, be-
comes a believer [is endowed with faith], is regenerated and renewed, by the power 
of the Holy Ghost through the Word when preached and heard, out of pure grace, 
without any cooperation of his own.
6] In order to explain this controversy in a Christian manner, according to the 
guidance of God’s Word, and by His grace to decide it, our doctrine, faith, and 
confession are as follows:
7] Namely, that in spiritual and divine things the intellect, heart, and will of the 
unregenerate man are utterly unable, by their own natural powers, to understand, 
believe, accept, think, will, begin, effect, do, work, or concur in working anything, 
but they are entirely dead to what is good, and corrupt, so that in man’s nature

493
since the Fall, before regeneration, there is not the least spark of spiritual power 
remaining, nor present, by which, of himself, he can prepare himself for God’s 
grace, or accept the offered grace, nor be capable of it for and of himself, or apply 
or accommodate himself thereto, or by his own powers be able of himself, as of 
himself, to aid, do, work, or concur in working anything towards his conversion, 
either wholly, or half, or in any, even the least or most inconsiderable part; but that 
he is the servant [and slave] of sin, John 8:34, and a captive of the devil, by whom he 
is moved, Eph. 2:2; 2 Tim. 2:26. Hence the natural free will according to its pervert-
ed disposition and nature is strong and active only with respect to what is displeas-
ing and contrary to God.
8] This declaration and principal [general] reply to the chief question and 
statement of the controversy presented in the introduction to this article is 
confirmed and substantiated by the following arguments from God’s Word, and 
although they are contrary to proud reason and philosophy, yet we know that the 
wisdom of this perverted world is only foolishness before God, and that articles of 
faith must be judged only from God’s Word.
9] For, first, although man’s reason or natural intellect indeed has still a dim spark 
of the knowledge that there is a God, as also of the doctrine of the Law, Rom. 
1:19ff, yet it is so ignorant, blind, and perverted that when even the most ingenious 
and learned men upon earth read or hear the Gospel of the Son of God and the 
promise of eternal salvation, they cannot from their own powers perceive, ap-
prehend, understand, or believe and regard it as true, but the more diligence and 
earnestness they employ, wishing to comprehend these spiritual things with their 
reason, the less they understand or believe, and before they become enlightened 
and are taught by the Holy Ghost, they regard all this only as foolishness or fic-
tions. 10] 1 Cor. 2:14: The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; 
for they are foolishness unto him. 1 Cor. 1:21: For after that, in the wisdom of God, 
the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching 
to save them that believe. Eph. 4:17f.: They (that is, those not born again of God’s 
Spirit) walk in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being 
alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the 
blindness of their heart. Matt. 13:11ff; Luke 8:18: Seeing they see not, and hearing 
they hear not, neither do they understand; but it is given unto you to know the 
mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. Rom. 3:11. 12: There is none that understan-
deth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they 
are all together become unprofitable, there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 
Accordingly, the Scriptures flatly call natural man in spiritual and divine things 
darkness, Eph. 5:8, Acts 26:18. John 1:5: The light shineth in darkness (that is, in the 
dark, blind world, which does not know or regard God), and the darkness compre-
The Lutheran Confessions
494
hendeth it not. Likewise, the Scriptures teach that man in sins is not only weak and 
sick, but defunct and entirely dead, Eph. 2:1. 5; Col. 2:13.
11] Now, just as a man who is physically dead cannot of his own powers prepare 
or adapt himself to obtain temporal life again, so the man who is spiritually dead 
in sins cannot of his own strength adapt or apply himself to the acquisition of 
spiritual and heavenly righteousness and life, unless he is delivered and quickened 
by the Son of God from the death of sin.
12] Therefore the Scriptures deny to the intellect, heart, and will of the natural 
man all aptness, skill, capacity, and ability to think, to understand, to be able to do, 
to begin, to will, to undertake, to act, to work or to concur in working anything 
good and right in spiritual things as of himself. 2 Cor. 3:5: Not that we are suffi-
cient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God. 
Rom. 3:12: They are together become unprofitable. John 8:37: My Word hath no 
place in you. John 1:5: The darkness comprehendeth (or receiveth) it not [the light]. 
1 Cor. 2:14: The natural man receiveth not (or, as the Greek word properly signifies, 
grasps not, comprehends not, accepts not) the things of the Spirit, that is, he is not 
capable of spiritual things; for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know 
them. 13] Much less will he truly believe the Gospel, or assent thereto and regard 
it as truth. Rom. 8:7: The carnal mind, or the mind of the natural man, is enmity 
against God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. And, in 
a word, it remains eternally true what the Son of God says, John 15; 5: Without Me 
ye can do nothing. And Paul, Phil. 2:13: It is God which worketh in you both to will 
and to do of His good pleasure. 14] To all godly Christians who feel and experience 
in their hearts a small spark or longing for divine grace and eternal salvation this 
precious passage is very comforting; for they know that God has kindled in their 
hearts this beginning of true godliness, and that He will further strengthen and 
help them in their great weakness to persevere in true faith unto the end.
15] Here belong also all the prayers of the saints in which they pray that they may 
be taught, enlightened, and sanctified by God, and by this very act declare that 
they cannot obtain those things which they ask of God from their own natural 
powers; as, in Ps. 119 alone David prays more than ten times that God would 
impart to him understanding, that he might rightly comprehend and learn the 
divine doctrine. [Very many] similar prayers are in the writings of Paul, Eph. 1:17; 
Col. 1:9; Phil. 1:9. These prayers and passages concerning our ignorance and inabil-
ity have been written for us, not for the purpose of rendering us idle and remiss 
in reading, hearing, and meditating upon God’s Word, but, first, that we should 
thank God from the heart that by His Son He has delivered us from the darkness 
of ignorance and the captivity of sin and death, and through Baptism and the Holy 
Ghost regenerated and illumined us.
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
495
16] And after God through the Holy Ghost in Baptism has kindled and effected a 
beginning of the true knowledge of God and faith, we should pray Him without 
ceasing that through the same spirit and His grace, by means of the daily exercise 
of reading and practising God’s Word, He would preserve in us faith and His heav-
enly gifts, strengthen us from day to day, and keep us to the end. For unless God 
Himself be our schoolmaster, we can study and learn nothing that is acceptable to 
Him and salutary to ourselves and others.
17] Secondly, God’s Word testifies that the intellect, heart, and will of the natural, 
unregenerate man in divine things are not only turned entirely away from God, but 
also turned and perverted against God to every evil; also, that he is not only weak, 
incapable, unfit, and dead to good, but also is so lamentably perverted, infected, 
and corrupted by original sin that he is entirely evil, perverse, and hostile to God 
by his disposition and nature, and that he is exceedingly strong, alive, and active 
with respect to everything that is displeasing and contrary to God. Gen. 8:22: The 
imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth. Jer. 17:9: The heart of man is de-
ceitful and desperately wicked, or perverted and full of misery, so that it is unfath-
omable. This passage St. Paul explains Rom. 8: The carnal mind is enmity against 
God. Gal. 5:17: The flesh lusteth against the spirit; and these are contrary the one to 
the other. Rom. 7:14: We know that the Law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under 
sin. And soon after, 18:23: I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good 
thing. For I delight in the Law of God after the inward man, which is regenerate by 
the Holy Ghost; but I see another law in my members, warring against the law of 
my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin.
18] Now, if in St. Paul and in other regenerate men the natural or carnal free will 
even after regeneration strives against God’s Law, it will be much more obstinate 
and hostile to God’s Law and will before regeneration. Hence it is manifest (as it 
is further declared in the article concerning original sin, to which we now refer 
for the sake of brevity) that the free will from its own natural powers, not only 
cannot work or concur in working anything for its own conversion, righteousness, 
and salvation, nor follow [obey], believe, or assent to the Holy Ghost, who through 
the Gospel offers him grace and salvation, but from its innate, wicked, rebellious 
nature it resists God and His will hostilely, unless it be enlightened and controlled 
by God’s Spirit.
19] On this account the Holy Scriptures also compare the heart of the 
unregenerate man to a hard stone, which does not yield to the one who touches 
it, but resists, and to a rough block, and to a wild, unmanageable beast; not that 
man since the Fall is no longer a rational creature, or is converted to God without 
hearing and meditating upon the divine Word, or in external, worldly things 
The Lutheran Confessions
496
cannot understand, or of his free will do, or abstain from doing, anything good or 
evil.
20] For, as Doctor Luther says Ps. 90: In worldly and external affairs; which pertain 
to the livelihood and maintenance of the body, man is cunning, intelligent, and 
quite active; but in spiritual and divine things, which pertain to the salvation of 
the soul, man is like a pillar of salt, like Lot’s wife, yea, like a log and a stone, like a 
lifeless statue, which uses neither eyes nor mouth, neither sense nor heart. 21] For 
man neither sees nor perceives the terrible and fierce wrath of God on account of 
sin and death [resulting from it], but ever continues in his security, even knowingly 
and willingly, and thereby falls into a thousand dangers, and finally into eternal 
death and damnation; and no prayers, no supplications, no admonitions, yea, also 
no threats, no chiding, are of any avail, yea, all teaching and preaching is lost upon 
him, until he is enlightened, converted, and regenerated by the Holy Ghost, 22] for 
which [renewal of the Holy Ghost], indeed, no stone or block, but man alone, was 
created. And although God, according to His just, strict sentence, has utterly cast 
away the fallen evil spirits forever, He has nevertheless, out of special, pure mercy, 
willed that poor fallen human nature might again become and be capable and par-
ticipant of conversion, the grace of God and eternal life; not from its own natural, 
active [or effective] skill, aptness, or capacity (for the nature of man is obstinate en-
mity against God), but from pure grace, through the gracious efficacious working 
of the Holy Ghost.” 23] And this Dr. Luther calls capacitatem (non activam, sed 
passivam), which he explains thus: Quando patres liberum arbitrium defendunt, capaci-
tatem liberatatis eius praedicant, quod scilicet verti potest ad bonum per gratiam Dei et fieri 
revera liberum, ad quod creatum est. That is: When the Fathers defend the free will, they 
are speaking of this, that it is capable of freedom in this sense, that by God’s grace it can be 
converted to good, and become truly free, for which it was created in the beginning. (Tom. 
1, p. 236.) To like effect also Augustine has written, lib. 2, Contra Iulianum. Doctor 
Luther on Hosea 6; also in the Church-Postil on the Epistle for Christmas; also on 
the Gospel for the third Sunday after Epiphany.
24] But before man is enlightened, converted, regenerated, renewed, and drawn 
by the Holy Ghost, he can of himself and of his own natural powers begin, 
work, or concur in working in spiritual things and in his own conversion or 
regeneration just as little as a stone or a block or clay. For although he can control 
the outward members and hear the Gospel, and to a certain extent meditate upon 
it, also discourse concerning it, as is to be seen in the Pharisees and hypocrites, 
nevertheless he regards it as foolishness, and cannot believe it. And in this respect 
he acts even worse than a block, inasmuch as he is rebellious and hostile to God’s 
will, unless the Holy Ghost is efficacious in him, and kindles and works in him 
faith and other virtues pleasing to God, and obedience.
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
497
25] Thirdly, in this manner, too, the Holy Scriptures ascribe conversion, faith in 
Christ, regeneration, renewal, and all that belongs to their efficacious beginning 
and completion, not to the human powers of the natural free will, neither entirely 
nor half, nor in any, even the least or most inconsiderable part, but in solidum, that 
is, entirely, solely, to the divine working and the Holy Ghost, as also the Apology 
teaches.
26] Reason and free will are able to a certain extent to live an outwardly decent 
life; but to be born anew, and to obtain inwardly another heart, mind, and 
disposition, this only the Holy Ghost effects. He opens the understanding and 
heart to understand the Scriptures and to give heed to the Word, as it is written 
Luke 24:45: Then opened He their understanding that they might understand the 
Scriptures. Also Acts 16:14: Lydia heard us; whose heart the Lord opened that she 
attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul. He worketh in us both to 
will and to do of His own good pleasure, Phil. 2:13. He gives repentance, Acts 5:31; 
2 Tim. 2:25. He works faith, Phil. 1:29: For unto you it is given, in behalf of Christ, 
not only to believe on Him. Eph. 2:8: It is the gift of God. John 6:29: This is the 
work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent. He gives an understand-
ing heart, seeing eyes, and hearing ears, Deut. 29:4; Matt. 13:15. He is a Spirit of 
regeneration and renewal, Titus 3:5. 6. He takes away the hard heart of stone, and 
gives a new tender heart of flesh, that we may walk in His commands, Ezek. 11:19; 
Deut. 30:6; Ps. 51:10. He creates us in Christ Jesus to good works, Eph. 2:10, and 
makes us new creatures, 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15. And, in short, Every good gift is of 
God, Jas. 1:17. No one can come to Christ unless the Father draw him, John 6:44. No 
one knoweth the Father, save him to whom the Son will reveal Him, Matt. 11:27. No 
one can call Christ Lord except by the Holy Ghost, 1 Cor. 12:3. Without Me, says 
Christ, ye can do nothing, John 15:5. All our sufficiency is of God, 2 Cor. 3:5. What 
hast thou that thou didst not receive? Now, if thou didst receive it, why dost thou 
glory as if thou hadst not received it? 1 Cor. 4:7. 27] Accordingly, St. Augustine 
particularly writes of this passage that by it he was convinced that he must lay 
aside his former erroneous opinion, when he had maintained the following in his 
treatise De Praedestinatione, chap. 3: Gratiam Dei in eo tantum consistere, quod in prae-
conio veritatis Dei voluntas nobis revelaretur; ut autem praedicato nobis evangelio consen-
tiremus, nostrum esse proprium et ex nobis esse. Item erravi (inquit), cum dicerem, nostrum 
esse credere et velle; Dei autem, dare credentibus et volentibus facultatem operandi. That is: 
I erred in this, that I held that the grace of God consists only in this, that God in 
the preaching of the truth reveals His will; but that our consenting to the preached 
Gospel is our own work, and is within our own powers. Likewise, St. Augustine 
writes further: I erred when I said that it is within our own power to believe the 
Gospel and to will; but it is God’s work to give to them that believe and will the 
power to effect something.
The Lutheran Confessions
498
28] This doctrine is founded upon God’s Word, and conformable to the Augsburg 
Confession and other writings above mentioned, as the following testimonies prove.
29] In Article XX the Confession says as follows: Because through faith the Holy 
Ghost is given, the heart thus becomes fit for doing good works. For before, 
because it is without the Holy Ghost, it is too weak, and, besides, is in the devil’s 
power, who drives poor human nature into many sins. [Without Christ, without 
faith, and without the Holy Ghost men are in the power of the devil, who drives 
men to manifold and open crimes. Therefore men are first taught regarding faith, 
how the Holy Spirit is given, and that Christ aids and protects us against the devil, 
etc.] And a little afterward: For without faith and without Christ human nature 
and ability [reason and virtue] are much too weak to do good works [to resist the 
devil who drives men into sinning].
30] These passages clearly testify that the Augsburg Confession does not at all 
recognize [pronounce] the will of man in spiritual things as free, but says that he is 
the devil’s captive; how, then, is he to be able of his own powers to turn himself to 
the Gospel or Christ?
31] The Apology (Art. XVIII) teaches thus of free will: [We do not deny liberty to 
the human will.] We also say that reason has, to a certain extent, a free will; for in 
the things which are to be comprehended by reason [as such] we have a free will 
[liberty in the choice of works and things]. And a little after: For such hearts as are 
without the Holy Ghost are without the fear of God, without faith, without trust 
[in God]; they do not believe that God hears them, that He forgives their sins, and 
helps them in troubles; therefore they are godless. 32] Now, “a corrupt tree cannot 
bring forth good fruit,” and “without faith it is impossible to please God.” There-
fore, although we concede that it is within our ability to perform such an outward 
work [we concede to free will the liberty and power to perform the outward works 
of the Law], nevertheless, we say that in spiritual things [truly to fear God, truly to 
believe in God] the free will and reason have no ability, etc. Here it is clearly seen 
that the Apology ascribes no ability to the will of man, either for beginning good 
or for operating of itself.
33] In the Smalcald Articles (Of Sin) also the following errors concerning the free 
will are rejected: That man has a free will to do good and omit evil, etc. And short-
ly afterward it is also rejected as an error when men teach: That it is not founded 
upon Scripture, that for a good work the Holy Ghost with His grace is necessary.
34] Furthermore, we read in the Smalcald Articles (Of Repentance), as follows: And 
in Christians this repentance continues until death, because through the entire life 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
499
it contends with sin remaining in the flesh, as Paul, Rom. 7:23, testifies that he wars 
with the Law in his members, etc., and that not by his own powers, but by the gift 
of the Holy Ghost, which follows the remission of sins. This gift daily cleanses and 
sweeps out the remaining sins, and works so as to render man truly pure and holy. 
These words say nothing whatever of our will, or that even in regenerate men it 
works anything of itself, but ascribe it to the gift of the Holy Ghost, which cleanses 
man and makes him daily more godly and holy; and our own powers are entirely 
excluded therefrom.
36] In the Large Catechism of Dr. Luther (the Third Article of the Christian Faith) 
it is written thus: And I am also a part and member of the same, a sharer and joint 
owner of all the goods it possesses, brought to it and incorporated into it by the 
Holy Ghost, by having heard and continuing to hear the Word of God, which is 
the beginning of entering it. 37] For formerly, before we had attained to this, we 
were altogether of the devil, knowing nothing of God and of Christ. Thus, until 
the last day, the Holy Ghost abides with the holy congregation or Christendom, 
by means of which He brings us to Christ, and which He employs to teach and 
preach to us the Word, whereby He works and promotes sanctification, causing 
[this community] daily to grow and become strong in the faith and the fruits of 
the Spirit, which He produces. 38] In these words the Catechism does not mention 
our free will or cooperation with a single word, but ascribes everything to the 
Holy Ghost, namely, that through the office of the ministry He brings us into the 
Christian Church, wherein He sanctifies us, and brings it about that we daily grow 
in faith and good works.
39] And although the regenerate even in this life advance so far that they will 
what is good, and love it, and even do good and grow in it, nevertheless this (as 
above stated) is not of our will and ability, but the Holy Ghost, as Paul himself 
speaks concerning this, works such willing and doing, Phil. 2:13. As also in Eph. 2:10 
he ascribes this work to God alone, when he says: For we are His workmanship, 
created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we 
should walk therein.
40] In the Small Catechism of Dr. Luther it is thus written: I believe that I cannot by 
my own reason or strength believe in Jesus Christ, my Lord, or come to Him; but 
the Holy Ghost has called me through the Gospel, enlightened me with His gifts, 
and sanctified and kept me in the true faith; even as He calls, gathers, enlightens, 
and sanctifies the whole Christian Church on earth, and keeps it with Jesus Christ 
in the one true faith, etc.
The Lutheran Confessions
500
41] And in the explanation of the Second Petition of the Lord’s Prayer the follow-
ing words occur: How is this, done? When our Heavenly Father gives us His Holy 
Spirit, so that by His grace we believe His holy Word and live a godly life, etc.
42] These testimonies state that by our own powers we cannot come to Christ, but 
God must give us His Holy Ghost, by whom we are enlightened, sanctified, and 
thus brought to Christ through faith, and kept with Him; and no mention is made 
either of our will or cooperation.
43] To this we will add a passage in which Dr. Luther declared himself later, with 
a solemn protestation that he intended to persevere in this doctrine unto the end, 
in his Large Confession concerning the Holy Supper, where he says: Herewith I 
reject and condemn as nothing but error all dogmas which extol our free will, as 
they directly conflict with this help and grace of our Savior Jesus Christ. For since 
outside of Christ death and sin are our lords, and the devil our god and prince, 
there can be no power or might, no wisdom or understanding, whereby we can 
qualify ourselves for, or strive after, righteousness and life; but we must be blinded 
people and prisoners of sin and the devil’s own, to do and to think what pleases 
them and is contrary to God and His commandments.
44] In these words Dr. Luther, of blessed and holy memory, ascribes to our free 
will no power whatever to qualify itself for righteousness or strive after it, but says 
that man is blinded and held captive to do only the devil’s will, and that which is 
contrary to God the Lord. Therefore there is here no cooperation of our will in 
the conversion of man, and man must be drawn and born anew of God; otherwise 
there is no thought in our hearts which of itself could turn to the holy Gospel for 
the purpose of accepting it. Even so Dr. Luther wrote of this matter also in his 
book De Servo Arbitrio, i. e., Of the Captive Will of Man, in opposition to Eras-
mus, and elucidated and supported this position well and thoroughly, and after-
ward he repeated and explained it in his glorious exposition of the book of Genesis, 
especially of Gen. 26. There likewise his meaning and understanding of some other 
peculiar disputations introduced incidentally by Erasmus, as of absolute necessity, 
etc., have been secured by him in the best and most careful way against all misun-
derstanding and perversion; to which we also hereby appeal and refer others.
45] Therefore it is teaching incorrectly to assert that unregenerate man has still so 
much power as to desire to receive the Gospel and to be comforted by it, and that 
thus the natural human will cooperates somewhat [in a manner] in conversion. For 
such an erroneous opinion is contrary to the holy, divine Scripture, the Christian 
Augsburg Confession, its Apology, the Smalcald Articles, the Large and the 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
501
Small Catechisms of Luther, and other writings of this excellent, highly [divinely] 
enlightened theologian.
46] This doctrine concerning the inability and wickedness of our natural free will 
and concerning our conversion and regeneration, namely, that it is a work of God 
alone and not of our powers, is [impiously, shamefully, and maliciously] abused 
in an unchristian manner both by enthusiasts and by Epicureans; and by their 
speeches many persons have become disorderly and irregular, and idle and indolent 
in all Christian exercises of prayer, reading and devout meditation; for they say 
that, since they are unable from their own natural powers to convert themselves 
to God, they will always strive with all their might against God, or wait until God 
converts them by force against their will; or since they can do nothing in these 
spiritual things, but everything is the operation of God the Holy Ghost alone, they 
will regard, hear, or read neither the Word nor the Sacrament, but wait until God, 
without means, instils into them His gifts from heaven, so that they can truly feel 
and perceive in themselves that God has converted them.
47] Other desponding [weak and disturbed] hearts [our godly doctrine concerning 
the free will not being rightly understood] might perhaps fall into hard thoughts 
and [perilous] doubts as to whether God has elected them, and will work His 
gifts also in them through the Holy Ghost, especially when they are sensible of no 
strong, ardent faith and sincere obedience, but only of weakness, fear, and misery.
48] For this reason we shall now relate, furthermore, from God’s Word how man is 
converted to God, how and through what means (namely, through the oral Word 
and the holy Sacraments) the Holy Ghost wants to be efficacious in us, and to 
work and bestow in our hearts true repentance, faith, and new spiritual power and 
ability for good, and how we should conduct ourselves towards these means, and 
[how we should] use them.
49] It is not God’s will that any one should be damned [perish], but that all men 
should be converted to Him and be saved eternally. Ezek. 33:11: As I live, I have no 
pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and 
live. John 3:16: For God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son, that 
whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
50] Therefore God, out of His immense goodness and mercy, has His divine 
eternal Law and His wonderful plan concerning our redemption, namely, the 
holy, alone-saving Gospel of His eternal Son, our only Savior and Redeemer, Jesus 
Christ, publicly preached; and by this [preaching] collects an eternal Church for 
Himself from the human race, and works in the hearts of men true repentance 
The Lutheran Confessions
502
and knowledge of sins, and true faith in the Son of God, Jesus Christ. And by this 
means, and in no other way, namely, through His holy Word, when men hear it 
preached or read it, and the holy Sacraments when they are used according to His 
Word, God desires to call men to eternal salvation, draw them to Himself, and 
convert, regenerate, and sanctify them. 51] 1 Cor. 1:21: For after that in the wisdom 
of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of 
preaching to save them that believe. Acts 10:5. 6: Peter shall tell thee what thou 
oughtest to do. Rom. 10:17: Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of 
God. John 17:17. 20: Sanctify them by Thy truth; Thy Word is truth, etc. Neither 
pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their 
Word. Therefore the eternal Father calls down from heaven concerning His dear 
Son and concerning all who preach repentance and forgiveness of sins in His name: 
Hear ye Him, Matt. 17:5.
52] Now, all who wish to be saved ought to hear this preaching [of God’s Word]. 
For the preaching and hearing of God’s Word are instruments of the Holy Ghost, 
by, with, and through which He desires to work efficaciously, and to convert men 
to God, and to work in them both to will and to do.
53] This Word man can externally hear and read, even though he is not yet 
converted to God and regenerate; for in these external things, as said above, man 
even since the Fall has to a certain extent a free will, so that he can go to church 
and hear or not hear the sermon.
54] Through this means, namely, the preaching and hearing of His Word, God 
works, and breaks our hearts, and draws man, so that through the preaching of 
the Law he comes to know his sins and God’s wrath, and experiences in his heart 
true terrors, contrition, and sorrow, and through the preaching and consideration 
of the holy Gospel concerning the gracious forgiveness of sins in Christ a spark 
of faith is kindled in him, which accepts the forgiveness of sins for Christ’s sake, 
and comforts itself with the promise of the Gospel, and thus the Holy Ghost (who 
works all this) is sent into the heart, Gal. 4:6.
55] Now, although both, the planting and watering of the preacher, and the 
running and willing of the hearer, would be in vain, and no conversion would 
follow it if the power and efficacy of the Holy Ghost were not added thereto, who 
enlightens and converts the hearts through the Word preached and heard, so that 
men believe this Word and assent thereto, still, neither preacher nor hearer is to 
doubt this grace and efficacy of the Holy Ghost, but should be certain that when 
the Word of God is preached purely and truly, according to the command and 
will of God, and men listen attentively and earnestly and meditate upon it, God is 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
503
certainly present with His grace, and grants, as has been said, what otherwise man 
can neither accept nor give from his own powers. 56] For concerning the presence, 
operation, and gifts of the Holy Ghost we should not and cannot always judge ex 
sensu [from feeling], as to how and when they are experienced in the heart; but 
because they are often covered and occur in great weakness, we should be certain 
from, and according to, the promise, that the Word of God preached and heard is 
[truly] an office and work of the Holy Ghost, by which He is certainly efficacious 
and works in our hearts, 2 Cor. 2:14ff; 3:5ff.
57] But if a man will not hear preaching nor read God’s Word, but despises the 
Word and congregation of God, and thus dies and perishes in his sins, he neither 
can comfort himself with God’s eternal election nor obtain His mercy; for Christ, 
in whom we are chosen, offers to all men His grace in the Word and holy Sacra-
ments, and wishes earnestly that it be heard, and has promised that where two or 
three are gathered together in His name and are occupied with His holy Word, He 
will be in their midst.
58] But when such a person despises the instrument of the Holy Ghost, and will 
not hear, no injustice is done to him if the Holy Ghost does not enlighten him, but 
allows him to remain in the darkness of his unbelief and to perish; for regarding 
this matter it is written: How often would I have gathered thy children together, 
even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings; and ye would not! Matt. 
23:37.
59] And in this respect it may well be said that man is not a stone or block. For 
a stone or block does not resist the person who moves it, nor does it understand 
and is sensible of what is being done with it, as man with his will so long resists 
God the Lord until he is [has been] converted. And it is nevertheless true that man 
before his conversion is still a rational creature, having an understanding and will, 
however, not an understanding with respect to divine things, or a will to will some-
thing good and salutary. Yet he can do nothing whatever towards his conversion 
(as has also been said [frequently] above), and is in this respect much worse than a 
stone and block; for he resists the Word and will of God, until God awakens him 
from the death of sin, enlightens and renews him.
60] And although God does not force man to become godly (for those who always 
resist the Holy Ghost and persistently oppose the known truth, as Stephen says 
of the hardened Jews, Acts 7:51, are not converted), yet God the Lord draws the 
man whom He wishes [decreed] to convert, and draws him in such a way that his 
darkened understanding is turned into an enlightened one and his perverse will 
The Lutheran Confessions
504
into an obedient one. And this [just this] is what the Scriptures call creating a new 
heart, Ps. 51:10.
61] And for this reason it cannot be correctly said that man before his conversion 
has a modus agendi, or a way, namely, of working something good and salutary in 
divine things. For inasmuch as man before his conversion is dead in sins, Eph. 2:5, 
there can be in him no power to work anything good in divine things, and hence, 
too, he has no modus agendi, or way of working in divine things. 62] But when 
we treat of the matter how God works in man, God has nevertheless [it is true, 
indeed, that God has] one modus agendi, or way of working in man, as in a rational 
creature, and another way of working in some other, irrational creature, or in a 
stone and block. Nevertheless, no modus agendi, or no way whatever of working 
something good in spiritual things, can be ascribed to man before his conversion.
63] But when man has been converted, and is thus enlightened, and his will is 
renewed, it is then that man wills what is good (so far as he is regenerate or a new 
man), and delights in the Law of God after the inward man, Rom. 7:22, and hence-
forth does good to such an extent and as long as he is impelled by God’s Spirit, as 
Paul says, Rom. 8:14: For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons 
of God. 64] And this impulse of the Holy Ghost is not a coactio, or coercion, but 
the converted man does good spontaneously, as David says, Ps. 110:4: Thy people 
shall be willing in the day of Thy power. And nevertheless that also [the strife of 
the flesh and spirit] remains in the regenerate of which St. Paul wrote, Rom. 7:22f : 
For I delight in the Law of God after the inward man; but I see another law in my 
members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to 
the law of sin which is in my members. Also, v. 25: So, then, with my mind I myself 
serve the Law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin. Also, Gal. 5:17: For the flesh 
lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the 
one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
65] From this, then, it follows that as soon as the Holy Ghost, as has been 
said, through the Word and holy Sacraments, has begun in us this His work of 
regeneration and renewal, it is certain that through the power of the Holy Ghost 
we can and should cooperate, although still in great weakness. But this [that we 
cooperate] does not occur from our carnal natural powers, but from the new 
powers and gifts which the Holy Ghost has begun in us in conversion, 66] as St. 
Paul expressly and earnestly exhorts that as workers together with Him we receive 
not the grace of God in vain, 2 Cor. 6:1. But this is to be understood in no other 
way than that the converted man does good to such an extent and so long as God 
by His Holy Spirit rules, guides, and leads him, and that as soon as God would 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
505
withdraw His gracious hand from him, he could not for a moment persevere in 
obedience to God. But if this were understood thus [if any one would take the ex-
pression of St. Paul in this sense], that the converted man cooperates with the Holy 
Ghost in the manner as when two horses together draw a wagon, this could in no 
way be conceded without prejudice to the divine truth. (2 Cor. 6:1: Sunergou’te” 
parakalou’men: We who are servants or coworkers with God beseech you who are 
God’s husbandry and God’s building, 1 Cor. 3:9, to imitate our example, that the 
grace of God may not be among you in vain, 1 Cor. 15:10, but that ye may be the 
temple of God, living and dwelling in you, 2 Cor. 6:16.)
67] Therefore there is a great difference between baptized and unbaptized men. For 
since, according to the doctrine of St. Paul, Gal. 3:27, all who have been baptized 
have put on Christ, and thus are truly regenerate, they have now arbitrium libera-
tum (a liberated will), that is, as Christ says, they have been made free again, John 
8:36; whence they are able not only to hear the Word, but also to assent to it and 
accept it, although in great weakness.
68] For since we receive in this life only the first-fruits of the Spirit, and the new 
birth is not complete, but only begun in us, the combat and struggle of the flesh 
against the spirit remains even in the elect and truly regenerate men; for there is 
a great difference perceptible among Christians not only in this, that one is weak 
and another strong in the spirit, but each Christian, moreover, experiences in 
himself that at one time he is joyful in spirit, and at another fearful and alarmed; at 
one time ardent in love, strong in faith and hope, and at another cold and weak.
69] But when the baptized have acted against their conscience, allowed sin to rule 
in them, and thus have grieved and lost the Holy Ghost in them, they need not be 
rebaptized, but must be converted again, as has been sufficiently said before.
70] For this is certainly true that in genuine conversion a change, new emotion 
[renewal], and movement in the intellect, will, and heart must take place, namely, 
that the heart perceive sin, dread God’s wrath, turn from sin, perceive and accept 
the promise of grace in Christ, have good spiritual thoughts, a Christian purpose 
and diligence, and strive against the flesh. For where none of these occurs or is 
present, there is also no true conversion. 71] But since the question is de causa 
efficiente (concerning the efficient cause), that is, who works this in us, and 
whence man has this, and how he attains it, this doctrine informs us that, since 
the natural powers of man cannot do anything or help towards it, 1 Cor. 2:14; 2 
Cor. 3:5, God, out of His infinite goodness and mercy, comes first to us [precedes 
us], and causes His holy Gospel to be preached, whereby the Holy Ghost desires 
to work and accomplish in us this conversion and renewal, and through preaching 
The Lutheran Confessions
506
and meditation upon His Word kindles in us faith and other godly virtues, so that 
they are gifts and operations of the Holy Ghost alone. 72] This doctrine, therefore, 
directs us to the means whereby the Holy Ghost desires to begin and work this 
[which we have mentioned], also instructs us how those gifts are preserved, 
strengthened, and increased, and admonishes us that we should not let this grace of 
God be bestowed on us in vain, but diligently exercise it [those gifts], and ponder 
how grievous a sin it is to hinder and resist such operations of the Holy Ghost.
73] From this thorough explanation of the entire doctrine concerning free will we 
can now judge, lastly, also the questions upon which, for quite a number of years, 
there has been controversy in the churches of the Augsburg Confession (An homo 
ante, in, post conversionem Spiritui Sancto repugnet, vel pure passive se habeat; 
an homo convertatur ut truncus; an Spiritus Sanctus detur repugnantibus, et an 
conversio hominis fiat per modum coactionis; that is, Whether man before, in, or 
after his conversion resists the Holy Ghost, and whether he does nothing whatever, 
but only suffers what God works in him [or is purely passive]; likewise, whether 
in conversion man acts and is like a block; likewise, whether the Holy Ghost is 
given to those who resist Him; likewise, whether conversion occurs by coercion, so 
that God coerces men to conversion by force against their wills), and can perceive, 
expose, censure, and reject the opposite dogmas and errors, namely:
74] 1. First, the folly of the Stoics and Manicheans [who asserted] that everything 
that happens must so happen, et hominem coactum omnia facere, that is, that man 
does everything from coercion, and that even in outward works the will of man 
has no freedom or ability to render to a certain extent external righteousness and 
respectable deportment, and to avoid external sins and vices, or that the will of 
man is coerced to external wicked deeds, inchastity, robbery, murder, etc.
75] 2. Secondly, the error of the gross Pelagians, that the free will, from its own 
natural powers, without the Holy Ghost, can turn to God, believe the Gospel; and 
be obedient to God’s Law from the heart, and by this its voluntary obedience can 
merit the forgiveness of sins and eternal life.
76] 3. Thirdly, the error of the Papists and scholastics, who have proceeded in a 
somewhat more subtile manner, and have taught that man from his own natural 
powers can make a beginning of doing good and of his own conversion, and that 
then the Holy Ghost, because man is too weak to bring it to completion, comes to 
the aid of the good begun from a person’s own natural powers.
77] 4. Fourthly, the doctrine of the Synergists, who pretend that man is not 
absolutely dead to good in spiritual things, but is badly wounded and half dead. 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
507
Therefore, although the free will is too weak to make a beginning, and to convert 
itself to God by its own powers, and to be obedient to God’s Law from the heart, 
nevertheless, when the Holy Ghost makes a beginning, and calls us through the 
Gospel, and offers His grace, the forgiveness of sins, and eternal salvation, that 
then the free will, from its own natural powers, can meet God, and to a certain 
extent, although feebly, do something towards it, help and cooperate thereto, can 
qualify itself for, and apply itself to, grace, and apprehend accept it, and believe 
the Gospel, and can also cooperate, by its own powers, with the Holy Ghost, in the 
continuation and maintenance of this work.
78] Over against this, however, it has been shown at length above that such power, 
namely, facultas applicandi se ad gratiam, that is, to qualify one’s self by nature for 
grace, does not proceed from our own natural powers, but alone from the opera-
tion of the Holy Ghost.
79] 5. Likewise, the following doctrine of the Popes and monks, that after his 
regeneration man can completely fulfil the Law of God in this life, and that 
through this fulfilment of the Law he is righteous before God and merits eternal 
life.
80] 6. On the other hand, the enthusiasts should be rebuked with great earnestness 
and zeal, and should in no way be tolerated in the Church of God, who imagine 
[dream] that God, without any means, without the hearing of the divine Word, 
and without the use of the holy Sacraments, draws men to Himself, and enlightens, 
justifies, and saves them.
81] 7. Also those who imagine that in conversion and regeneration God creates 
a new heart and new man in such a way that the substance and essence of the 
old Adam, and especially the rational soul, are completely destroyed, and a new 
essence of the soul is created out of nothing. This error St. Augustine expressly 
rebukes in [his exposition of] Psalm 25, where he quotes the passage from Paul, Eph. 
4:22: Put off the old man, etc., and explains it in the following words: Ne aliquis 
arbitretur deponendam esse aliquam substantiam, exposuit, quid esset: “Deponite 
veterem hominem et induite novum”, cum dicit in consequentibus: “Quapropter 
deponentes mendacium, loquimini veritatem.” Ecce, hoc est deponere veterem ho-
minem et induere novum etc.; that is, Lest any one might think that the substance 
or essence of man is to be laid aside, he has himself explained what it is to lay aside 
the old man, and to put on the new, when he says in the succeeding words: “Putting 
away lying, speak the truth.” Behold, that is to put off the old man and to put on 
the new.
The Lutheran Confessions
508
82] 8. Likewise, if the following expressions are used without being explained, 
namely, that the will of man before, in, and after conversion resists the Holy Ghost, 
and that the Holy Ghost is given to those who resist Him.
83] For from the preceding explanation it is manifest that where no change 
whatever in intellect, will, and heart occurs through the Holy Ghost to that which 
is good, and man does not at all believe the promise, and is not rendered fit by God 
for grace, but entirely resists the Word, there no conversion takes place or can be. 
For conversion is such a change through the operation of the Holy Ghost in the 
intellect, will, and heart of man that by this operation of the Holy Ghost man can 
accept the offered grace. And, indeed, all those who obstinately and persistently 
resist the operations and movements of the Holy Ghost, which take place through 
the Word, do not receive, but grieve and lose, the Holy Ghost.
84] Now, there remains, nevertheless, also in the regenerate, an obstinacy [a certain 
rebelliousness] of which the Scriptures speak, namely, that the flesh lusteth against 
the spirit, Gal. 5:17, likewise, that fleshly lusts war against the soul, 1 Pet. 2:11, and 
that the law in the members wars against the law of the mind, Rom. 7:23.
85] Accordingly, the man who is not regenerate resists God altogether, and is 
entirely a servant of sin, John 8:34; Rom. 6:16. The regenerate person, however, 
delights in the Law of God after the inward man, but nevertheless sees in his 
members the law of sin, which wars against the law of the mind; on this account he 
serves the Law of God with his mind, but with the flesh the law of sin, Rom. 7:25. 
In this way the correct opinion can and should be thoroughly, clearly, and discreet-
ly explained and taught.
86] As to the expressions of Chrysostom and Basil: Trahit Deus, sed volentem 
trahit; tantum velis, et Deus praeoccurrit, likewise, the saying of the Scholastics 
[and Papists], Hominis voluntas in conversione non est otiosa, sed agit aliquid, 
that is, God draws, but He draws the willing; likewise: Only be willing, and God 
will anticipate you; likewise: In conversion the will of man is not idle, but effects 
something (expressions which have been introduced for confirming the natural free 
will in man’s conversion, against the doctrine concerning God’s grace), it is mani-
fest from the explanation heretofore presented that they are not in harmony with 
the form of sound doctrine, but contrary to it, and therefore ought to be avoided 
when we speak of conversion to God.
87] For the conversion of our corrupt will, which is nothing else than a 
resuscitation of it from spiritual death, is only and solely the work of God (just 
as also the resuscitation in the resurrection of the body must be ascribed to God 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
509
alone), as has been fully set forth above and proved by manifest testimonies of 
Holy Scripture.
88] But how God in conversion changes stubborn and unwilling into willing men 
through the drawing of the Holy Ghost, and that after such conversion, in the daily 
exercise of repentance, the regenerate will of man is not idle, but also cooperates 
in all the works of the Holy Ghost which He does through us, has already been 
sufficiently explained above.
89] So also when Luther says that with respect to his conversion man is pure 
passive (purely passive), that is, does nothing whatever towards it, but only suffers 
what God works in him, his meaning is not that conversion takes place without the 
preaching and hearing of God’s Word; nor is this his meaning, that in conversion 
no new emotion whatever is awakened in us by the Holy Ghost and no spiritual 
operation begun; but he means that man of himself, or from his natural powers, 
cannot do anything or help towards his conversion, and that conversion is not only 
in part, but altogether an operation, gift, and present, and work of the Holy Ghost 
alone, who accomplishes and effects it by His power and might, through the Word, 
in the intellect, will, and heart of man, tamquam in subiecto patiente, that is, while 
man does or works nothing, but only suffers; not as a figure is cut into stone or 
a seal impressed into wax, which knows nothing of it, neither perceives and wills 
this, but in the way which has been recounted and explained a short while ago.
90] Since also the youths in the schools have been greatly perplexed de tribus 
causis efficientibus, concurrentibus in conversione hominis non renati, that is, by 
the doctrine of the three efficient causes of the conversion of unregenerate man 
to God, as to the manner in which they, namely, the Word of God preached and 
heard, the Holy Ghost, and the will of man, concur, it is again manifest from the 
explanation above presented that conversion to God is a work of God the Holy 
Ghost alone, who is the true Master that alone works this in us, for which He uses 
the preaching and hearing of His Holy Word as His ordinary [and lawful] means 
and instrument. But the intellect and will of the unregenerate man are nothing 
else than subiectum convertendum, that is, that which is to be converted, it being 
the intellect and will of a spiritually dead man, in whom the Holy Ghost works 
conversion and renewal, towards which work man’s will that is to be converted 
does nothing, but suffers God alone to work in him, until he is regenerate; and 
then he works also with the Holy Ghost [cooperates] that which is pleasing to God 
in other good works that follow, in the way and to the extent fully set forth above.

510
III. The Righteousness of Faith
1] The third controversy which has arisen among some theologians of the Augsburg 
Confession is concerning the righteousness of Christ or of faith, which God 
imputes by grace, through faith, to poor sinners for righteousness.
2] For one side has contended that the righteousness of faith, which the apostle 
calls the righteousness of God, is God’s essential righteousness, which is Christ 
Himself as the true, natural, and essential Son of God, who dwells in the elect by 
faith and impels them to do right, and thus is their righteousness, compared with 
which righteousness the sins of all men are as a drop of water compared with the 
great ocean.
3] Over against this, others have held and taught that Christ is our righteousness 
according to His human nature alone.
4] In opposition to both these parties it has been unanimously taught by the 
other teachers of the Augsburg Confession that Christ is our righteousness not 
according to His divine nature alone, nor according to His human nature alone, 
but according to both natures; for He has redeemed, justified, and saved us from 
our sins as God and man, through His complete obedience; that therefore the 
righteousness of faith is the forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God, and our 
adoption as God’s children only on account of the obedience of Christ, which 
through faith alone, out of pure grace, is imputed for righteousness to all true be-
lievers, and on account of it they are absolved from all their unrighteousness.
5] Besides this [controversy] there have been still other disputes caused and 
excited on account of the Interim [on occasion of the formula of the Interim or 
of Interreligion], and otherwise, concerning the article of justification, which will 
hereafter be explained in antithesi, that is, in the enumeration of those errors 
which are contrary to the pure doctrine in this article.
6] This article concerning justification by faith (as the Apology says) is the chief 
article in the entire Christian doctrine, without which no poor conscience can 
have any firm consolation, or can truly know the riches of the grace of Christ, as 
Dr. Luther also has written: If this only article remains pure on the battlefield, the 
Christian Church also remains pure, and in goodly harmony and without any sects; 
but if it does not remain pure, it is not possible that any error or fanatical spirit 
can be resisted. (Tom. 5, Jena, p. 159.) 7] And concerning this article especially 
Paul says that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. Therefore, in this article he 
urges with so much zeal and earnestness the particulas exclusivas, that is, the words 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
511
whereby the works of men are excluded (namely, without Law, without works, by 
grace [freely], Rom. 3:28; 4:5; Eph. 2:8-9), in order to indicate how highly necessary 
it is that in this article, aside from [the presentation of] the pure doctrine, the 
antithesis, that is, all contrary dogmas, be stated separately, exposed, and rejected 
by this means.
8] Therefore, in order to explain this controversy in a Christian way by means of 
God’s Word, and, by His grace, to settle it, our doctrine, faith, and confession are 
as follows:
9] Concerning the righteousness of faith before God we believe, teach, and confess 
unanimously, in accordance with the comprehensive summary of our faith and 
confession presented above, that poor sinful man is justified before God, that is, 
absolved and declared free and exempt from all his sins, and from the sentence of 
well-deserved condemnation, and adopted into sonship and heirship of eternal 
life, without any merit or worth of our own, also without any preceding, present, 
or any subsequent works, out of pure grace, because of the sole merit, complete 
obedience, bitter suffering, death, and resurrection of our Lord Christ alone, 
whose obedience is reckoned to us for righteousness.
10] These treasures are offered us by the Holy Ghost in the promise of the holy 
Gospel; and faith alone is the only means by which we lay hold upon, accept, and 
apply, and appropriate them to ourselves. 11] This faith is a gift of God, by which 
we truly learn to know Christ, our Redeemer, in the Word of the Gospel, and trust 
in Him, that for the sake of His obedience alone we have the forgiveness of sins 
by grace, are regarded as godly and righteous by God the father, and are eternally 
saved. 12] Therefore it is considered and understood to be the same thing when 
Paul says that we are justified by faith, Rom. 3:28, or that faith is counted to us for 
righteousness, Rom. 4:5, and when he says that we are made righteous by the obe-
dience of One, Rom. 5:19, or that by the righteousness of One justification of faith 
came to all men, Rom. 5:18. 13] For faith justifies, not for this cause and reason 
that it is so good a work and so fair a virtue, but because it lays hold of and accepts 
the merit of Christ in the promise of the holy Gospel; for this must be applied 
and appropriated to us by faith, if we are to be justified thereby. 14] Therefore the 
righteousness which is imputed to faith or to the believer out of pure grace is the 
obedience, suffering, and resurrection of Christ, since He has made satisfaction 
for us to the Law, and paid for [expiated] our sins. 15] For since Christ is not man 
alone, but God and man in one undivided person, He was as little subject to the 
Law, because He is the Lord of the Law, as He had to suffer and die as far as His 
person is concerned. For this reason, then, His obedience, not only in suffering 
and dying, but also in this, that He in our stead was voluntarily made under the 
The Lutheran Confessions
512
Law, and fulfilled it by this obedience, is imputed to us for righteousness, so that, 
on account of this complete obedience, which He rendered His heavenly Father 
for us, by doing and suffering, in living and dying, God forgives our sins, regards 
us as godly and righteous, and eternally saves us. 16] This righteousness is offered 
us by the Holy Ghost through the Gospel and in the Sacraments, and is applied, 
appropriated, and received through faith, whence believers have reconciliation 
with God, forgiveness of sins, the grace of God, sonship, and heirship of eternal 
life.
17] Accordingly, the word justify here means to declare righteous and free from 
sins, and to absolve one from eternal punishment for the sake of Christ’s righteous-
ness, which is imputed by God to faith, Phil. 3:9. For this use and understanding of 
this word is common in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and the New Testament. 
Prov. 17:15: He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even 
they both are abomination to the Lord. Is. 5:23: Woe unto them which justify the 
wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him! 
Rom. 8:33: Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justi-
fieth, that is, absolves from sins and acquits.
18] However, since the word regeneratio, regeneration, is sometimes employed 
for the word iustificatio, justification, it is necessary that this word be properly 
explained, in order that the renewal which follows justification of faith may not be 
confounded with the justification of faith, but that they may be properly distin-
guished from one another.
19] For, in the first place, the word regeneratio, that is, regeneration, is used so as to 
comprise at the same time the forgiveness of sins for Christ’s sake alone, and the 
succeeding renewal which the Holy Ghost works in those who are justified by faith. 
Then, again, it is [sometimes] used pro remissione peccatorum et adoptione in filios Dei, 
that is, so as to mean only the remission of sins, and that we are adopted as sons 
of God. And in this latter sense the word is much and often used in the Apology, 
where it is written: Iustificatio est regeneratio, that is, Justification before God is 
regeneration. St. Paul, too, has employed these words as distinct from one anoth-
er, Titus 3:5: He saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy 
Ghost. 20] As also the word vivificatio, that is, making alive, has sometimes been 
used in a like sense. For when man is justified through faith (which the Holy Ghost 
alone works), this is truly a regeneration, because from a child of wrath he becomes 
a child of God, and thus is transferred from death to life, as it is written: When we 
were dead in sins, He hath quickened us together with Christ, Eph. 2:5. Likewise: 
The just shall live by faith, Rom. 1:17; Hab. 2:4. In this sense the word is much and 
often used in the Apology.
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
513
21] But again, it is often taken also for sanctification and renewal, which succeeds 
the righteousness of faith, as Dr. Luther has thus used it in his book concerning the 
Church and the Councils, and elsewhere.
22] But when we teach that through the operation of the Holy Ghost we are born 
anew and justified, the sense is not that after regeneration no unrighteousness 
clings any more to the justified and regenerate in their being and life, but that 
Christ covers all their sins which nevertheless in this life still inhere in nature with 
His complete obedience. But irrespective of this they are declared and regarded 
godly and righteous by faith and for the sake of Christ’s obedience (which Christ 
rendered the Father for us from His birth to His most ignominious death upon the 
cross), although, on account of their corrupt nature, they still are and remain sin-
ners to the grave [while they bear about this mortal body]. Nor, on the other hand, 
is this the meaning, that without repentance, conversion, and renewal we might or 
should yield to sins, and remain and continue in them.
23] For true [and not feigned] contrition must precede; and to those who, in the 
manner stated, out of pure grace, for the sake of the only Mediator, Christ, without 
any works and merit, are righteous before God, that is, are received into grace, the 
Holy Ghost is also given, who renews and sanctifies them, and works in them love 
to God and to their neighbor. But since the incipient renewal is imperfect in this 
life, and sin still dwells in the flesh, even in the regenerate, the righteousness of 
faith before God consists in the gracious imputation of the righteousness of Christ, 
without the addition of our works, so that our sins are forgiven us and covered, 
and are not imputed, Rom. 4:6ff
24] But here very good attention must be given with especial diligence, if the 
article of justification is to remain pure, lest that which precedes faith, and 
that which follows after it, be mingled together or inserted into the article of 
justification as necessary and belonging to it, because it is not one or the same 
thing to speak of conversion and of justification.
25] For not everything that belongs to conversion belongs likewise to the article 
of justification, in and to which belong and are necessary only the grace of God, 
the merit of Christ, and faith, which receives this in the promise of the Gospel, 
whereby the righteousness of Christ is imputed to us, whence we receive and have 
forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God, sonship, and heirship of eternal life.
26] Therefore true, saving faith is not in those who are without contrition and 
sorrow, and have a wicked purpose to remain and persevere in sins; but true 
The Lutheran Confessions
514
contrition precedes, and genuine faith is in or with true repentance [justifying 
faith is in those who repent truly, not feignedly].
27] Love is also a fruit which surely and necessarily follows true faith. For the 
fact that one does not love is a sure indication that he is not justified, but is still 
in death, or has lost the righteousness of faith again, as John says, 1 John 3:14. But 
when Paul says, Rom. 3:28: We are justified by faith without works, he indicates 
thereby that neither the contrition that precedes, nor the works that follow, belong 
in the article or transaction of justification by faith. For good works do not pre-
cede justification, but follow it, and the person must first be justified before he can 
do good works.
28] In like manner also renewal and sanctification, although it is also a benefit of 
the Mediator, Christ, and a work of the Holy Ghost, does not belong in the article 
or affair of justification before God, but follows the same since, on account of 
our corrupt flesh, it is not entirely perfect and complete in this life, as Dr. Luther 
writes well concerning this in his beautiful and large exposition of the Epistle to 
the Galatians, in which he says as follows: 29] We concede indeed that instruction 
should be given also concerning love and good works, yet in such a way that this be done 
when and where it is necessary, namely, when otherwise and outside of this matter of 
justification we have to do with works. But here the chief matter dealt with is the question, 
not whether we should also do good works and exercise love, but by what means we can 
be justified before God, and saved. And here we answer thus with St. Paul: that we are 
justified by faith in Christ alone, and not by the deeds of the Law or by love. Not that we 
hereby entirely reject works and love, as the adversaries falsely slander and accuse us, but 
that we do not allow ourselves to be led away, as Satan desires, from the chief matter with 
which we have to do here to another and foreign affair which does not at all belong to this 
matter. Therefore, whereas, and as long as we are occupied with this article of justification, 
we reject and condemn works, since this article is so constituted that it can admit of no 
disputation or treatment whatever regarding works; therefore in this matter we cut short all 
Law and works of the Law. So far Luther.
30] In order, therefore, that troubled hearts may have a firm, sure consolation, 
also, that due honor be given to the merit of Christ and the grace of God, the 
Scriptures teach that the righteousness of faith before God consists alone in the 
gracious [gratuitous] reconciliation or the forgiveness of sins, which is presented 
to us out of pure grace, for the sake of the only merit of the Mediator, Christ, and 
is received through faith alone in the promise of the Gospel. In like manner, too, 
in justification before God faith relies neither upon contrition nor upon love or 
other virtues, but upon Christ alone, and in Him upon His complete obedience by 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
515
which He has fulfilled the Law for us, which [obedience] is imputed to believers for 
righteousness.
31] Moreover, neither contrition nor love or any other virtue, but faith alone is the 
sole means and instrument by which and through which we can receive and accept 
the grace of God, the merit of Christ, and the forgiveness of sins, which are offered 
us in the promise of the Gospel.
32] It is also correctly said that believers who in Christ through faith have been 
justified, have in this life first the imputed righteousness of faith, and then also the 
incipient righteousness of the new obedience or of good works. But these two must 
not be mingled with one another or be both injected at the same time into the 
article of justification by faith before God. For since this incipient righteousness or 
renewal in us is incomplete and impure in this life because of the flesh, the person 
cannot stand with and by it [on the ground of this righteousness] before God’s tri-
bunal, but before God’s tribunal only the righteousness of the obedience, suffering, 
and death of Christ, which is imputed to faith, can stand, so that only for the sake 
of this obedience is the person (even after his renewal, when he has already many 
good works and lives the best [upright and blameless] life) pleasing and acceptable 
to God, and is received into adoption and heirship of eternal life.
33] Here belongs also what St. Paul writes Rom. 4:3, that Abraham was justified 
before God by faith alone, for the sake of the Mediator, without the cooperation 
of his works, not only when he was first converted from idolatry and had no good 
works, but also afterwards, when he had been renewed by the Holy Ghost, and 
adorned with many excellent good works, Gen. 15:6; Heb. 11:8. And Paul puts the 
following question, Rom. 4:1ff : On what did Abraham’s righteousness before God 
for everlasting life, by which he had a gracious God, and was pleasing and accept-
able to Him, rest at that time?
34] This he answers: To him who worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth 
the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness; as David also, Ps. 32:1, speaks of 
the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness without works. 35] 
Hence, even though the converted and believing [in Christ] have incipient renewal, 
sanctification, love, virtue, and good works, yet these neither can nor should be 
drawn into, or mingled with, the article of justification before God, in order that 
the honor due Him may remain with Christ the Redeemer, and tempted conscienc-
es may have a sure consolation, since our new obedience is incomplete and impure.
36] And this is the meaning of the Apostle Paul when in this article he urges so 
diligently and zealously the particulas exclusivas, that is, the words by which works 
The Lutheran Confessions
516
are excluded from the article of justification: absque operibus, sine lege, gratis, 
non ex operibus, that is, by grace, without merit, without works, not of works. 
These exclusivae are all comprised in the expression: By faith alone in Christ we are 
justified before God and saved. For thereby works are excluded, not in the sense 
that a true faith can exist without contrition, or that good works should, must, 
and dare not follow true faith as sure and indubitable fruits, or that believers dare 
not nor must do anything good; but good works are excluded from the article 
of justification before God, so that they must not be drawn into, woven into, or 
mingled with the transaction of the justification of the poor sinner before God 
as necessary or belonging thereto. And the true sense of the particulae exclusivae 
in articulo iustificationis, that is, of the aforementioned terms, in the article of 
justification, consists in the following, and they should also be urged in this article 
with all diligence and earnestness [on account of these reasons]:
37] 1. That thereby [through these particles] all our own works, merit, worthiness, 
glory, and confidence in all our works are entirely excluded in the article of 
justification so that our works shall not be constituted or regarded as either the 
cause or the merit of justification, neither entirely, nor half, nor in the least part, 
upon which God could or ought to look, or we to rely in this article and action.
38] 2. That this remain the office and property of faith alone, that it alone, and 
nothing else whatever, is the means or instrument by and through which God’s 
grace and the merit of Christ in the promise of the Gospel are received, appre-
hended, accepted, applied to us, and appropriated; and that from this office and 
property of such application or appropriation love and all other virtues or works 
are excluded.
39] 3. That neither renewal, sanctification, virtues nor good works are tamquam 
forma aut pars aut causa iustificationis, that is, our righteousness before God, nor 
are they to be constituted and set up as a part or cause of our righteousness, or 
otherwise under any pretext, title, or name whatever to be mingled in the article of 
justification as necessary and belonging thereto; but that the righteousness of faith 
consists alone in the forgiveness of sins out of pure grace, for the sake of Christ’s 
merit alone; which blessings are offered us in the promise of the Gospel, and are 
received, accepted, applied, and appropriated by faith alone.
40] In the same manner the order also between faith and good works must 
abide and be maintained, and likewise between justification and renewal, or 
sanctification.
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
517
41] For good works do not precede faith, neither does sanctification precede 
justification. But first faith is kindled in us in conversion by the Holy Ghost from 
the hearing of the Gospel. This lays hold of God’s grace in Christ, by which the per-
son is justified. Then, when the person is justified, he is also renewed and sanctified 
by the Holy Ghost, from which renewal and sanctification the fruits of good works 
then follow. Et haec non ita divelluntur, quasi vera fides aliquando et aliquamdiu stare 
possit cum malo proposito, sed ordine causarum et effectuum, antecedentium et consequenti-
um, ita distribuuntur. Manet enim, quod Lutherus recte dicit: Bene conveniunt et sunt con-
nexa inseparabiliter fides et opera; sed sola fides est, quae apprehendit benedictionem sine 
operibus, et tamen nunquam est sola. That is: This should not be understood as though 
justification and renewal were sundered from one another in such a manner that a 
genuine faith sometimes could exist and continue for a time together with a wick-
ed intention, but hereby only the order [of causes and effects, of antecedents and 
consequents] is indicated, how one precedes or succeeds the other. For what Luther 
has correctly said remains true nevertheless: Faith and good works well agree and 
fit together [are inseparably connected]; but it is faith alone, without works, which 
lays hold of the blessing; and yet it is never and at no time alone. This has been set 
forth above.
42] Many disputations also are usefully and well explained by means of this true 
distinction, of which the Apology treats in reference to the passage James 2:20. For 
when we speak of faith, how it justifies, the doctrine of St. Paul is that faith alone, 
without works, justifies, Rom. 3:28, inasmuch as it applies and appropriates to us 
the merit of Christ, as has been said. But if the question is, wherein and whereby a 
Christian can perceive and distinguish, either in himself or in others, a true living 
faith from a feigned and dead faith, (since many idle, secure Christians imagine 
for themselves a delusion in place of faith, while they nevertheless have no true 
faith,) the Apology gives this answer: James calls that dead faith where good works 
and fruits of the Spirit of every kind do not follow. And to this effect the Latin 
edition of the Apology says: Iacobus recte negat, nos tali fide iustificari, quae est 
sine operibus, hoc est, quae mortua est. That is: St. James teaches correctly when he 
denies that we are justified by such a faith as is without works, which is dead faith.
43] But James speaks, as the Apology says, concerning the works of those who 
have already been justified through Christ, reconciled with God, and obtained 
forgiveness of sins through Christ. But if the question is, whereby and whence 
faith has this, and what appertains to this that it justifies and saves, it is false and 
incorrect to say: Fidem non posse iustificare sine operibus; vel fidem, quatenus 
caritatem, qua formatur, coniunctam habet, iustificare; vel fidei, ut iustificet, 
necessariam esse praesentiam bonorum operum; vel bona opera esse causam sine 
qua non, quae per particulas exclusivas ex articulo iustificationis non excludantur. 
The Lutheran Confessions
518
That is: That faith cannot justify without works; or that faith justifies or makes 
righteous, inasmuch as it has love with it, for the sake of which love this is ascribed 
to faith [it has love with it, by which it is formed]; or that the presence of works 
with faith is necessary if otherwise man is to be justified thereby before God; or 
that the presence of good works in the article of justification, or for justification, 
is needful, so that good works are a cause without which man cannot be justified, 
and that they are not excluded from the article of justification by the particulae 
exclusivae: absque operibus etc., that is, when St. Paul says: without works. For 
faith makes righteous only inasmuch as and because, as a means and instrument, it 
lays hold of, and accepts, the grace of God and the merit of Christ in the promise 
of the Gospel.
44] Let this suffice, according to the plan of this document, as a summary 
explanation of the doctrine of justification by faith, which is treated more at length 
in the above-mentioned writings. From these, the antithesis also, that is, the false 
contrary dogmas, are manifest, namely, that in addition to the errors recounted 
above also the following and similar ones, which conflict with the explanation now 
published, must be censured, exposed, and rejected, as when it is taught:
45] 1. That our love or good works are a merit or cause of justification before God, 
either entirely or at least in part.
46] 2. Or that by good works man must render himself worthy and fit that the mer-
it of Christ may be imparted to him.
47] 3. Vel formalem nostram iustitiam coram Deo esse inhaerentem nostram 
novitatem seu caritatem; that is, that our real righteousness before God is the love 
or renewal which the Holy Ghost works in us, and which is in us.
48] 4. Or that two things or parts belong to the righteousness of faith before God 
in which it consists, namely, the gracious forgiveness of sins, and then, secondly, 
also renewal or sanctification.
49] 5. Item, fidem iustificare tantum initialiter, vel partialiter, vel principaliter; 
et novitatem vel caritatem nostram iustificare etiam coram Deo vel completive, 
vel minus principaliter (that is, that faith justifies only initially, either in part 
or primarily, and that our newness or love justifies even before God, either 
completively or secondarily).
50] 6. Item, credentes coram Deo iustificari vel coram Deo iustos esse simul et 
imputatione et inchoatione, vel partim imputatione, partim inchoatione novae 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
519
obedientiae (that is, also that believers are justified before God, or are righteous 
before God, both by imputation and by inchoation at the same time, or partly 
by the imputation of Christ’s righteousness and partly by the beginning of new 
obedience).
51] 7. Item, applicationem promissionis gratiae fieri et fide cordis et confessione 
oris ac reliquis virtutibus (that is, also that the application of the promise of 
grace occurs both by faith of the heart and confession of the mouth, and by other 
virtues). That is: Faith makes righteous for this reason alone, that righteousness is 
begun in us by faith, or in this way, that faith takes the precedence in justification; 
nevertheless, renewal and love also belong to our righteousness before God, 
however, in such a way that it is not the chief cause of our righteousness, but that 
our righteousness before God is not entire and complete without such love and 
renewal. Likewise, that believers are justified and righteous before God at the same 
time by the imputed righteousness of Christ and the incipient new obedience, or 
in part by the imputation of Christ’s righteousness and in part by the incipient 
new obedience. Likewise, that the promise of grace is appropriated to us by faith in 
the heart, and confession which is made with the mouth, and by other virtues.
52] Also this is incorrect, when it is taught that man must be saved in some other 
way or through something else than as he is justified before God, so that we are 
indeed justified before God by faith alone, without works, but that it is impossible 
to be saved without works or obtain salvation without works.
53] This is false, for the reason that it is directly opposed to the declaration of Paul, 
Rom. 4:6: The blessedness is of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness 
without works. And Paul’s reason [the basis of Paul’s argument] is that we obtain 
both, salvation as well as righteousness, in one and the same way; yea, that by: this 
very means, when we are justified by faith, we receive at the same time adoption 
and heirship of eternal life and salvation; and on this account Paul employs and 
emphasizes the particulas exclusivas, that is, those words by which works and our 
own merits are entirely excluded, namely, by grace, without works, as forcibly in 
the article concerning salvation as in the article concerning righteousness.
54] Likewise also the disputation concerning the indwelling in us of the essential 
righteousness of God must be correctly explained. For although in the elect, who 
are justified by Christ and reconciled with God, God the Father, Son, and Holy 
Ghost, who is the eternal and essential righteousness, dwells by faith (for all 
Christians are temples of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who also impels 
them to do right), yet this indwelling of God is not the righteousness of faith of 
which St. Paul treats and which he calls iustitiam Dei, that is, the righteousness of 
The Lutheran Confessions
520
God, for the sake of which we are declared righteous before God; but it follows the 
preceding righteousness of faith, which is nothing else than the forgiveness of sins 
and the gracious adoption of the poor sinner, for the sake of Christ’s obedience and 
merit alone.
55] Accordingly, since in our churches it is acknowledged [established beyond 
controversy] among the theologians of the Augsburg Confession that all our 
righteousness is to be sought outside the merits, works, virtues, and worthiness of 
ourselves and of all men, and rests alone upon Christ the Lord, it must be carefully 
considered in what respect Christ is called our Righteousness in this affair of 
justification, namely, that our righteousness rests not upon one or the other nature, 
but upon the entire person of Christ, who as God and man is our Righteousness in 
His only, entire, and complete obedience.
56] For even though Christ had been conceived and born without sin by the Holy 
Ghost, and had fulfilled all righteousness in His human nature alone, and yet had 
not been true and eternal God, this obedience and suffering of His human nature 
could not be imputed to us for righteousness. As also, if the Son of God had not 
become man, the divine nature alone could not be our righteousness. Therefore we 
believe, teach, and confess that the entire obedience of the entire person of Christ, 
which He has rendered the Father for us even to His most ignominious death upon 
the cross, is imputed to us for righteousness. For the human nature alone, without 
the divine, could neither by obedience nor suffering render satisfaction to eternal 
almighty God for the sins of all the world; however, the divinity alone, without the 
humanity, could not mediate between God and us.
57] But, since it is the obedience as above mentioned [not only of one nature, but] 
of the entire person, it is a complete satisfaction and expiation for the human 
race, by which the eternal, immutable righteousness of God, revealed in the Law, 
has been satisfied, and is thus our righteousness, which avails before God and 
is revealed in the Gospel, and upon which faith relies before God, which God 
imputes to faith, as it is written, Rom. 5:19: For as by one man’s disobedience many 
were made sinners, so by the obedience of One shall many be made righteous; 
and 1 John 1:7: The blood of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, cleanseth us from all sin. 
Likewise: The just shall live by his faith, Hab. 2:4; Rom. 1:17.
58] Thus neither the divine nor the human nature of Christ by itself is imputed 
to us for righteousness, but only the obedience of the person who is at the same 
time God and man. And faith thus regards the person of Christ as it was made 
under the Law for us, bore our sins, and in His going to the Father offered to His 
heavenly Father for us poor sinners His entire, complete obedience, from His holy 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
521
birth even unto death, and has thereby covered all our disobedience which inheres 
in our nature, and its thoughts, words, and works, so that it is not imputed to 
us for condemnation, but is pardoned and forgiven out of pure grace, alone for 
Christ’s sake.
59] Therefore we unanimously reject and condemn, besides the above-mentioned, 
also the following and all similar errors, as contrary to God’s Word, the doctrine of 
the prophets and apostles, and our Christian faith:
60] 1. When it is taught that Christ is our righteousness before God according to 
His divine nature alone.
61] 2. That Christ is our righteousness according to His human nature alone.
62] 3. That in the passages from the prophets and apostles, when the righteousness 
of faith is spoken of, the words justify and to be justified are not to signify to declare 
free from sins and to obtain the forgiveness of sins, but to be made actually and 
really righteous because of love infused by the Holy Ghost, virtues, and the works 
following from it.
63] 4. That faith looks not only to the obedience of Christ, but to His divine nature 
as it dwells and works in us, and that by this indwelling our sins are covered before 
God.
64] 5. That faith is such a trust in the obedience of Christ as can be and remain 
in a person notwithstanding he has no genuine repentance, in whom also no love 
follows, but who persists in sins against his conscience.
65] 6. That not God dwells in the believers, but only the gifts of God.
66] These and like errors, one and all, we unanimously reject as contrary to the 
clear Word of God, and by God’s grace abide firmly and constantly in the doctrine 
of the righteousness of faith before God, as it is embodied, expounded, and proved 
from God’s Word in the Augsburg Confession, and the Apology issued after it.
67] Concerning what is needful furthermore for the proper explanation of this 
profound and chief article of justification before God, upon which depends the 
salvation of our souls, we direct, and for the sake of brevity herewith refer, every 
one to Dr. Luther’s beautiful and glorious exposition of the Epistle of St. Paul to 
the Galatians.
The Lutheran Confessions
522
IV. Good Works
1] A disagreement has also occurred among the theologians of the Augsburg 
Confession concerning good works, one part employing the following words and 
manner in speaking of them: Good works are necessary for salvation; it is impossible 
to be saved without good works; likewise, no one has been saved without good works; be-
cause, they say, good works are required of true believers as fruits of faith, and faith 
without love is dead, although such love is no cause of salvation.
2] The other part, however, contended, on the contrary, that good works are 
indeed necessary; however, not for salvation, but for other reasons; and that on 
this account the aforecited propositiones, or expressions, which have been used (as 
they are not in accord with the form of sound doctrine and with the Word, and 
have been always and are still set by the Papists in opposition to the doctrine of 
our Christian faith, in which we confess that faith alone justifies and saves) are not 
to be tolerated in the Church, in order that the merit of Christ, our Savior, be not 
diminished, and the promise of salvation may be and remain firm and certain to 
believers.
3] In this controversy also the following controverted proposition, or expression, 
was employed by some few, that good works are injurious to salvation. It has also been 
argued by some that good works are not necessary, but are voluntary[free and spon-
taneous], because they are not extorted by fear and the penalty of the Law, but are 
to be done from a voluntary spirit and a joyful heart. Over against this the other 
side contended that good works are necessary.
4] This [latter] controversy was originally occasioned by the words necessitasand 
libertas, that is, necessary and free, because especially the word necessitas, necessary, 
signifies not only the eternal, immutable order according to which all men are 
obliged and in duty bound to obey God, but sometimes also a coercion, by which 
the Law forces men to good works.
5] But afterwards there was a disputation not only concerning the words, but the 
doctrine itself was attacked in the most violent manner, and it was contended 
that the new obedience in the regenerate is not necessary because of the above-
mentioned divine order.
6] In order to explain this disagreement in a Christian way and according to the 
guidance of God’s Word, and by His grace to settle it completely, our doctrine, 
faith, and confession are as follows:
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
523
7] First, there is no controversy among our theologians concerning the following 
points in this article, namely: that it is God’s will, order, and command that be-
lievers should walk in good works; and that truly good works are not those which 
every one contrives himself from a good intention, or which are done according to 
traditions of men, but those which God Himself has prescribed and commanded in 
His Word; also, that truly good works are done, not from our own natural powers, 
but in this way: when the person by faith is reconciled with God and renewed by 
the Holy Ghost, or, as Paul says, is created anew in Christ Jesus to good works, 
Eph. 2:10.
8] Nor is there a controversy as to how and why the good works of believers, 
although in this flesh they are impure and incomplete, are pleasing and acceptable 
to God, namely, for the sake of the Lord Christ, by faith, because the person 
is acceptable to God. For the works which pertain to the maintenance of 
external discipline, which are also done by, and required of, the unbelieving and 
unconverted, although commendable before the world, and besides rewarded 
by God in this world with temporal blessings, are nevertheless, because they do 
not proceed from true faith, in God’s sight sins, that is, stained with sin, and are 
regarded by God as sins and impure on account of the corrupt nature and because 
the person is not reconciled with God. For a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good 
fruit, Matt. 7:18, as it is also written Rom. 14:23: Whatsoever is not of faith is sin. 
For the person must first be accepted of God, and that for the sake of Christ alone, 
if also the works of that person are to please Him.
9] Therefore, of works that are truly good and well-pleasing to God, which God 
will reward in this world and in the world to come, faith must be the mother and 
source; and on this account they are called by St. Paul true fruits of faith, as also 
of the Spirit. 10] For, as Dr. Luther writes in the Preface to St. Paul’s Epistle to the 
Romans: Thus faith is a divine work in us, that changes us and regenerates us of 
God, and puts to death the old Adam, makes us entirely different men in heart, 
spirit, mind, and all powers, and brings with it [confers] the Holy Ghost. Oh, it is 
a living, busy, active, powerful thing that we have in faith, so that it is impossible 
for it not to do good without ceasing. 11] Nor does it ask whether good works are 
to be done; but before the question is asked, it has wrought them, and is always 
engaged in doing them. But he who does not do such works is void of faith, and 
gropes and looks about after faith and good works, and knows neither what faith 
nor what good works are, yet babbles and prates with many words concerning 
faith and good works. 12] [Justifying] faith is a living, bold [firm] trust in God’s 
grace, so certain that a man would die a thousand times for it [rather than suffer 
this trust to be wrested from him]. And this trust and knowledge of divine grace 
The Lutheran Confessions
524
renders joyful, fearless, and cheerful towards God and all creatures, which [joy and 
cheerfulness] the Holy Ghost works through faith; and on account of this, man 
becomes ready and cheerful, without coercion, to do good to every one, to serve 
every one, and to suffer everything for love and praise to God, who has conferred 
this grace on him, so that it is impossible to separate works from faith, yea, just as 
impossible as it is for heat and light to be separated from fire.
13] But since there is no controversy on these points among our theologians, we 
will not treat them here at length, but only explain ourselves, part against part, in a 
simple and plain manner regarding the controverted points.
14] And first, as regards the necessity or voluntariness of good works, it is manifest 
that in the Augsburg Confession and its Apology these expressions are often 
used and repeated that good works are necessary. Likewise, that it is necessary 
to do good works, which also are necessarily to follow faith and reconciliation. 
Likewise, that we necessarily are to do and must do such good works as God has 
commanded. Thus also in the Holy Scriptures themselves the words necessity, 
needful, and necessary, likewise, ought and must, are used concerning what we are 
bound to do because of God’s ordinance, command, and will, as Rom. 13:5; 1 Cor. 
9:9; Acts 5:29; John 15:12; 1 John 4:21.
15] Therefore the expressions or propositions mentioned [that good works are 
necessary, and that it is necessary to do good] are unjustly censured and rejected in 
this Christian and proper sense, as has been done by some; for they are employed 
and used with propriety to rebuke and reject the secure, Epicurean delusion, by 
which many fabricate for themselves a dead faith or delusion which is without 
repentance and without good works, as though there could be in a heart true faith 
and at the same time the wicked intention to persevere and continue in sins, which 
is impossible; or, as though one could, indeed, have and retain true faith, righteous-
ness, and salvation even though he be and remain a corrupt and unfruitful tree, 
whence no good fruits whatever come, yea, even though he persist in sins against 
conscience, or purposely engages again in these sins, all of which is incorrect and 
false.
16] But in this connection the following distinction must also be noted, namely, 
that the meaning must be: necessitas ordinis, mandati et voluntatis Christi ac debiti 
nostri, non autem necessitas coactionis (a necessity of Christ’s ordinance, command, 
and will, and of our obligation, but not a necessity of coercion). That is: When this 
word necessary is employed, it should be understood not of coercion, but only of 
the ordinance of the immutable will of God, whose debtors we are; thither also 
17] His commandment points that the creature should be obedient to its Creator. 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
525
For in other places, as 2 Cor. 9:7, and in the Epistle of St. Paul to Philemon 14, 
also 1 Pet. 5:2, that is termed of necessity which is wrung from one against his will, 
by force or otherwise, so that he acts externally for appearance, but nevertheless 
without and against his will. For such specious [hypocritical] works God does not 
want [does not approve], but the people of the New Testament are to be a willing 
people, Ps. 110:3, and sacrifice freely, Ps. 54:6, not grudgingly or of necessity, but are 
to be obedient from the heart, 2 Cor. 9:7; Rom. 6:17. 18] For God loveth a cheerful 
giver, 2 Cor. 9:7. In this understanding and in such sense it is correctly said and 
taught that truly good works should be done willingly or from a voluntary spirit by 
those whom the Son of God has made free, even as it was especially for [confirm-
ing] this opinion that the disputation concerning the voluntariness of good works 
was engaged in by some.
19] But here, again, it is well to note also the distinction of which St. Paul says, 
Rom. 7:22f.: [I am willing] and delight in the Law of God after the inward man. But 
I see another law in my members, that is not only unwilling or disinclined, but also 
warring against the law of my mind. And as regards the unwilling and rebellious 
flesh, Paul says, 1 Cor. 9:27: I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection, and 
Gal. 5:24; Rom. 8:13: They that are Christ’s have crucified, yea, slain, the flesh with 
its affections and lusts. 20] But it is false, and must be censured, when it is asserted 
and taught as though good works were free to believers in the sense that it were 
optional with them to do or to omit them, or that they might or could act contrary 
thereto [to the Law of God], and none the less could retain faith and God’s favor 
and grace.
21] Secondly, when it is taught that good works are necessary, it must also 
be explained why and for what reasons they are necessary, which reasons are 
enumerated in the Augsburg Confession and Apology.
22] But here we must be well on our guard lest works are drawn and mingled 
into the article of justification and salvation. Therefore the propositions are justly 
rejected, that to believers good works are necessary for salvation, so that it is impossible 
to be saved without good works. For they are directly contrary to the doctrine de 
particulis exclusivis in articulo iustificationis et salvationis (concerning the exclusive 
particles in the article of justification and salvation), that is, they conflict with 
the words by which St. Paul has entirely excluded our works and merits from the 
article of justification and salvation, and ascribed everything to the grace of God 
and the merit of Christ alone, as explained in the preceding article. 23] Again, they 
[these propositions concerning the necessity of good works for salvation] take from 
afflicted, troubled consciences the comfort of the Gospel, give occasion for doubt, 
are in many ways dangerous, strengthen presumption in one’s own righteousness 
The Lutheran Confessions
526
and confidence in one’s own works; besides, they are accepted by the Papists, 
and in their interest adduced against the pure doctrine of the alone-saving faith. 
24] Moreover, they are contrary to the form of sound words, as it is written that 
blessedness is only of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without 
works, Rom. 4:6. Likewise, in the Sixth Article of the Augsburg Confession it is 
written that we are saved without works, by faith alone. Thus Dr. Luther, too, has 
rejected and condemned these propositions:
25] 1. In the false prophets among the Galatians [who led the Galatians into error].
26] 2. In the Papists, in very many places.
27] 3. In the Anabaptists, when they present this interpretation: We should not 
indeed rest faith upon the merit of works, but we must nevertheless have them as 
things necessary to salvation.
28] 4. Also in some others among his own followers, who wished to interpret this 
proposition thus: Although we require works as necessary to salvation, yet we do 
not teach to place trust in works. On Gen. 22.
29] Accordingly, and for the reasons now enumerated, it is justly to remain settled 
in our churches, namely, that the aforesaid modes of speech should not be taught, 
defended, or excused, but be thrown out of our churches and repudiated as false 
and incorrect, and as expressions which were renewed in consequence of the Inter-
im, originated from it, and were [again] drawn into discussion in times of persecu-
tion, when there was especial need of a clear, correct confession against all sorts of 
corruptions and adulterations of the article of justification.
30] Thirdly, since it is also disputed whether good works preserve salvation, or 
whether they are necessary for preserving faith, righteousness, and salvation, and 
this again is of high and great importance,–for he that shall endure unto the end, 
the same shall be saved, Matt. 24:13; also Heb. 3:6-14: We are made partakers of 
Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end,–we must 
also explain well and precisely how righteousness and salvation are preserved in us, 
lest it be lost again.
31] Above all, therefore, the false Epicurean delusion is to be earnestly censured 
and rejected, namely, that some imagine that faith and the righteousness and 
salvation which they have received can be lost through no sins or wicked deeds, not 
even through wilful and intentional ones, but that a Christian although he indulges 
his wicked lusts without fear and shame, resists the Holy Ghost, and purposely 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
527
engages in sins against conscience, yet none the less retains faith, God’s grace, righ-
teousness, and salvation.
32] Against this pernicious delusion the following true, immutable, divine threats 
and severe punishments and admonitions should be often repeated and impressed 
upon Christians who are justified by faith: 1 Cor. 6:9: Be not deceived: neither 
fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, etc., shall inherit the kingdom of God. 
Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5: They which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 
Rom. 8:13: If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die. Col. 3:6: For which thing’s sake the 
wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedience.
33] But when and in what way the exhortations to good works can be earnestly 
urged from this basis without darkening the doctrine of faith and of the article of 
justification, the Apology shows by an excellent model, when in Article XX, on the 
passage 2 Pet. 1:10: Give diligence to make your calling and election sure, it says 
as follows: Peter teaches why good works should be done, namely, that we may 
make our calling sure, that is, that we may not fall from our calling if we again sin. 
“Do good works,” he says, “that you may persevere in your heavenly calling, that 
you may not fall away again, and lose the Spirit and the gifts, which come to you, 
not on account of works that follow, but of grace, through Christ, and are now 
retained by faith. But faith does not remain in those who lead a sinful life, lose the 
Holy Ghost, and reject repentance.” Thus far the Apology.
34] But, on the other hand, the sense is not that faith only in the beginning 
lays hold of righteousness and salvation, and then resigns its office to the works 
as though thereafter they had to sustain faith, the righteousness received, and 
salvation; but in order that the promise, not only of receiving, but also of retaining 
righteousness and salvation, may be firm and sure to us, St. Paul, Rom. 5:2, ascribes 
to faith not only the entrance to grace, but also that we stand in grace and boast 
of the future glory, that is, the beginning, middle, and end he ascribes all to faith 
alone. Likewise, Rom. 11:20: Because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou 
standest by faith. Col. 1:22: He will present you holy and unblamable and unreprov-
able in His sight, if ye continue in the faith. 1 Pet. 1:5. 9: By the power of God we 
are kept through faith unto salvation. Likewise: Receiving the end of your faith, 
even the salvation of your souls.
35] Since, then, it is manifest from God’s Word that faith is the proper and only 
means by which righteousness and salvation are not only received, but also pre-
served by God, the decree of the Council of Trent, and whatever elsewhere is set 
forth in the same sense, is justly to be rejected, namely, that our good works pre-
The Lutheran Confessions
528
serve salvation, or that the righteousness of faith which has been received, or even 
faith itself, is either entirely or in part kept and preserved by our works.
36] For although before this controversy quite a few pure teachers employed 
such and similar expressions in the exposition of the Holy Scriptures, in no way, 
however, intending thereby to confirm the above-mentioned errors of the Papists, 
still, since afterwards a controversy arose concerning such expressions, from which 
all sorts of offensive distractions [debates, offenses, and dissensions] followed, it is 
safest of all, according to the admonition of St. Paul, 2 Tim. 1:13, to hold fast as well 
to the form of sound words as to the pure doctrine itself, whereby much unneces-
sary wrangling may be cut off and the Church preserved from many scandals.
37] Fourthly, as regards the proposition that good works are said to be injurious 
to salvation, we explain ourselves clearly as follows: If any one should wish to drag 
good works into the article of justification, or rest his righteousness or trust for 
salvation upon them, to merit God’s grace and be saved by them, to this not we say, 
but St. Paul himself says, and repeats it three times, Phil. 3:7ff , that to such a man 
his works are not only useless and a hindrance, but also injurious. But this is not the 
fault of the good works themselves, but of the false confidence placed in the works, 
contrary to the express Word of God.
38] However, it by no means follows thence that we are to say simpliciter and flatly: 
Good works are injurious to believers for or as regards their salvation; for in believers 
good works are indications of salvation when they are done propter veras causas et 
ad veros fines (from true causes and for true ends), that is, in the sense in which God 
requires them of the regenerate, Phil. 1:20; for it is God’s will and express command 
that believers should do good works, which the Holy Ghost works in believers, and 
with which God is pleased for Christ’s sake, and to which He promises a glorious 
reward in this life and the life to come.
39] For this reason, too, this proposition is censured and rejected in our churches, 
because as a flat statement it is false and offensive, by which discipline and decency 
might be impaired, and a barbarous, dissolute, secure, Epicurean life be introduced 
and strengthened. For what is injurious to his salvation a person should avoid with 
the greatest diligence.
40] However, since Christians should not be deterred from good works, but should 
be admonished and urged thereto most diligently, this bare proposition cannot and 
must not be tolerated, employed, nor defended in the Church [of Christ].

V. Law and Gospel
1] As the distinction between the Law and the Gospel is a special brilliant light, 
which serves to the end that God’s Word may be rightly divided, and the Scriptures 
of the holy prophets and apostles may be properly explained and understood, we 
must guard it with especial care, in order that these two doctrines may not be 
mingled with one another, or a law be made out of the Gospel, whereby the merit 
of Christ is obscured and troubled consciences are robbed of their comfort, which 
they otherwise have in the holy Gospel when it is preached genuinely and in its pu-
rity, and by which they can support themselves in their most grievous trials against 
the terrors of the Law.
2] Now, here likewise there has occurred a dissent among some theologians of the 
Augsburg Confession; for the one side asserted that the Gospel is properly not only 
a preaching of grace, but at the same time also a preaching of repentance, which 
rebukes the greatest sin, namely, unbelief. But the other side held and contended 
that the Gospel is not properly a preaching of repentance or of reproof [preach-
ing of repentance, convicting sin], as that properly belongs to God’s Law, which 
reproves all sins, and therefore unbelief also; but that the Gospel is properly a 
preaching of the grace and favor of God for Christ’s sake, through which the unbe-
lief of the converted, which previously inhered in them, and which the Law of God 
reproved, is pardoned and forgiven.
3] Now, when we consider this dissent aright, it has been caused chiefly by this, 
that the term Gospel is not always employed and understood in one and the same 
sense, but in two ways, in the Holy Scriptures, as also by ancient and modern 
church teachers. 4] For sometimes it is employed so that there is understood by 
it the entire doctrine of Christ, our Lord, which He proclaimed in His ministry 
upon earth, and commanded to be proclaimed in the New Testament, and hence 
comprised in it the explanation of the Law and the proclamation of the favor 
and grace of God, His heavenly Father, as it is written, Mark 1:1: The beginning 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And shortly afterwards the chief 
heads are stated: Repentance and forgiveness of sins. Thus, when Christ after His 
resurrection commanded the apostles to preach the Gospel in all the world, Mark 
16:15, He compressed the sum of this doctrine into a few words, when He said, 
Luke 24:46,47: Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise 
from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be 
preached in His name among all nations. So Paul, too, calls his entire doctrine the 
Gospel, Acts 20:21; but he embraces the sum of this doctrine under the two heads: 
Repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 5] And in this 
sense the generalis definitio, that is, the description of the word Gospel, when 
The Lutheran Confessions
530
employed in a wide sense and without the proper distinction between the Law and 
the Gospel is correct, when it is said that the Gospel is a preaching of repentance 
and the remission of sins. For John, Christ, and the apostles began their preaching 
with repentance and explained and urged not only the gracious promise of the 
forgiveness of sins, but also the Law of God. 6] Furthermore the term Gospel is 
employed in another, namely, in its proper sense, by which it comprises not the 
preaching of repentance, but only the preaching of the grace of God, as follows 
directly afterwards, Mark 1:15, where Christ says: Repent, and believe the Gospel.
7] Likewise the term repentance also is not employed in the Holy Scriptures in 
one and the same sense. For in some passages of Holy Scripture it is employed and 
taken for the entire conversion of man, as Luke 13:5: Except ye repent, ye shall all 
likewise perish. And in 15:7: Likewise joy shalt be in heaven over one sinner that 
repenteth. 8] But in this passage, Mark 1:15, as also elsewhere, where repentance 
and faith in Christ, Acts 20:21, or repentance and remission of sins, Luke 24:46-47, 
are mentioned as distinct, to repent means nothing else than truly to acknowledge 
sins, to be heartily sorry for them, and to desist from them. 9] This knowledge 
comes from the Law, but is not sufficient for saving conversion to God, if faith in 
Christ be not added, whose merits the comforting preaching of the holy Gospel 
offers to all penitent sinners who are terrified by the preaching of the Law. For the 
Gospel proclaims the forgiveness of sins, not to coarse and secure hearts, but to the 
bruised or penitent, Luke 4:18. And lest repentance or the terrors of the Law turn 
into despair, the preaching of the Gospel must be added, that it may be a repen-
tance unto salvation, 2 Cor. 7:10.
10] For since the mere preaching of the Law, without Christ, either makes 
presumptuous men, who imagine that they can fulfill the Law by outward works, 
or forces them utterly to despair, Christ takes the Law into His hands, and explains 
it spiritually, Matt. 5:21ff ; Rom. 7:14 and Rom 1:18, and thus reveals His wrath from 
heaven upon all sinners, and shows how great it is; whereby they are directed to 
the Law, and from it first learn to know their sins aright-a knowledge which Moses 
never could extort from them. For as the apostle testifies, 2 Cor. 3:14f, even though 
Moses is read, yet the veil which he put over his face is never lifted, so that they 
cannot understand the Law spiritually, and how great things it requires of us, and 
how severely it curses and condemns us because we cannot observe or fulfil it. Nev-
ertheless, when it shalt turn to the Lord, the veil shalt be taken away, 2 Cor. 3:16.
11] Therefore the Spirit of Christ must not only comfort, but also through the 
office of the Law reprove the world of sin, John 16:8, and thus must do in the New 
Testament, as the prophet says, Is. 28:21, opus alienum, ut faciat opus proprium, 
that is, He must do the work of another (reprove), in order that He may [after-
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
531
wards] do His own work, which is to comfort and preach of grace. For to this end 
He was earned [from the Father] and sent to us by Christ, and for this reason, too, 
He is called the Comforter, as Dr. Luther has explained in his exposition of the 
Gospel for the Fifth Sunday after Trinity, in the following words:
12] Anything that preaches concerning our sins and God’s wrath, let it be done 
how or when it will, that is all a preaching of the Law. Again, the Gospel is such 
a preaching as shows and gives nothing else than grace and forgiveness in Christ, 
although it is true and right that the apostles and preachers of the Gospel (as 
Christ Himself also did) confirm the preaching of the Law, and begin it with those 
who do not yet acknowledge their sins nor are terrified at [by the sense of] God’s 
wrath; as He says, John 16:8: 13] “The Holy Ghost will reprove the world of sin 
because they believe not on Me.” Yea, what more forcible, more terrible declaration 
and preaching of God’s wrath against sin is there than just the suffering and death 
of Christ, His Son? But as long as all this preaches God’s wrath and terrifies men, 
it is not yet the preaching of the Gospel nor Christ’s own preaching, but that 
of Moses and the Law against the impenitent. For the Gospel and Christ were 
never ordained and given for the purpose of terrifying and condemning, but of 
comforting and cheering those who are terrified and timid. And again: Christ says, 
John 16:8: “The Holy Ghost will reprove the world of sin”; which cannot be done 
except through the explanation of the Law. Jena, Tom. 2, fol. 455.
14] So, too, the Smalcald Articles say: The New Testament retains and urges the 
office of the Law, which reveals sins and God’s wrath; but to this office it immedi-
ately adds the promise of grace through the Gospel.
15] And the Apology says: To a true and salutary repentance the preaching of the 
Law alone is not sufficient, but the Gospel should be added thereto. Therefore the 
two doctrines belong together, and should also be urged by the side of each other, 
but in a definite order and with a proper distinction; and the Antinomians or 
assailants of the Law are justly condemned, who abolish the preaching of the Law 
from the Church, and wish sins to be reproved, and repentance and sorrow to be 
taught, not from the Law, but from the Gospel.
16] But in order that every one may see that in the dissent of which we are treating 
we conceal nothing, but present the matter to the eyes of the Christian reader 
plainly and clearly:
17] Therefore [we shall set forth our meaning:] we unanimously believe, teach, 
and confess that the Law is properly a divine doctrine, in which the righteous, 
immutable will of God is revealed, what is to be the quality of man in his nature, 
The Lutheran Confessions
532
thoughts, words, and works, in order that he may be pleasing and acceptable 
to God; and it threatens its transgressors with God’s wrath and temporal and 
eternal punishments. For as Luther writes against the law-stormers [Antinomians]: 
Everything that reproves sin is and belongs to the Law, whose peculiar office it is 
to reprove sin and to lead to the knowledge of sins, Rom. 3:20,7:7; and as unbelief 
is the root and well-spring of all reprehensible sins [all sins that must be censured 
and reproved], the Law reproves unbelief also.
18] However, this is true likewise that the Law with its doctrine is illustrated and 
explained by the Gospel; and nevertheless it remains the peculiar office of the Law 
to reprove sins and teach concerning good works.
19] Thus, the Law reproves unbelief, [namely,] when men do not believe the Word 
of God. Now, since the Gospel, which alone properly teaches and commands to 
believe in Christ, is God’s Word, the Holy Ghost, through the office of the Law, 
also reproves unbelief, that men do not believe in Christ, although it is properly 
the Gospel alone which teaches concerning saving faith in Christ.
20] However, now that man has not kept the Law of God, but transgressed it, his 
corrupt nature, thoughts, words, and works fighting against it, for which reason he 
is under God’s wrath, death, all temporal calamities, and the punishment of hell-
fire, the Gospel is properly a doctrine which teaches what man should believe, that 
he may obtain forgiveness of sins with God, namely, that the Son of God, our Lord 
Christ, has taken upon Himself and borne the curse of the Law, has expiated and 
paid for all our sins, through whom alone we again enter into favor with God, ob-
tain forgiveness of sins by faith, are delivered from death and all the punishments 
of sins, and eternally saved.
21] For everything that comforts, that offers the favor and grace of God to 
transgressors of the Law, is, and is properly called, the Gospel, a good and joyful 
message that God will not punish sins, but forgive them for Christ’s sake.
22] Therefore every penitent sinner ought to believe, that is, place his confidence in 
the Lord Christ alone, that He was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again 
for our justification, Rom. 4:25, that He was made sin for us who knew no sin, that 
we might be made the righteousness of God in Him, 2 Cor. 5:21, who of God is 
made unto us Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification, and Redemption, 
1 Cor. 1:30, whose obedience is counted to us for righteousness before God’s strict 
tribunal, so that the Law, as above set forth, is a ministration that kills through the 
letter and preaches condemnation, 2 Cor. 3:7, but the Gospel is the power of God 
unto salvation to every one that believeth, Rom. 1:16, that preaches righteousness 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
533
and gives the Spirit, 1 Cor. 1:18; Gal. 3:2. As Dr. Luther has urged this distinction 
with especial diligence in nearly all his writings, and has properly shown that the 
knowledge of God derived from the Gospel is far different from that which is 
taught and learned from the Law, because even the heathen to a certain extent had 
a knowledge of God from the natural law, although they neither knew Him aright 
nor glorified Him aright, Rom. 1:20f.
23] From the beginning of the world these two proclamations [kinds of doctrines] 
have been ever and ever inculcated alongside of each other in the Church of God, 
with a proper distinction. For the descendants of the venerated patriarchs, as also 
the patriarchs themselves, not only called to mind constantly how in the beginning 
man had been created righteous and holy by God, and through the fraud of the 
Serpent had transgressed God’s command, had become a sinner, and had corrupted 
and precipitated himself with all his posterity into death and eternal condemna-
tion, but also encouraged and comforted themselves again by the preaching con-
cerning the Seed of the Woman, who would bruise the Serpent’s head, Gen. 3:15; 
likewise, concerning the Seed of Abraham, in whom all the nations of the earth 
shall be blessed, Gen. 22:18; likewise, concerning David’s Son, who should restore 
again the kingdom of Israel and be a light to the heathen, Ps. 110:1; Is. 49:6; Luke 
2:32, who was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities, by 
whose stripes we are healed, Is. 53:5.
24] These two doctrines, we believe and confess, should ever and ever be diligently 
inculcated in the Church of God even to the end of the world, although with the 
proper distinction of which we have heard, in order that, through the preaching 
of the Law and its threats in the ministry of the New Testament the hearts of 
impenitent men may be terrified, and brought to a knowledge of their sins and to 
repentance; but not in such a way that they lose heart and despair in this process, 
but that (since the Law is a schoolmaster unto Christ that we might be justified by 
faith, Gal. 3:24, and thus points and leads us not from Christ, but to Christ, who 
is the end of the Law, Rom. 10:4) 25] they be comforted and strengthened again 
by the preaching of the holy Gospel concerning Christ, our Lord, namely, that to 
those who believe the Gospel, God forgives all their sins through Christ, adopts 
them as children for His sake, and out of pure grace, without any merit on their 
part, justifies and saves them, however, not in such a way that they may abuse the 
grace of God, 26] and sin hoping for grace, as Paul, 2 Cor. 3:7ff , thoroughly and 
forcibly shows the distinction between the Law and the Gospel.
27] Now, in order that both doctrines, that of the Law and that of the Gospel, be 
not mingled and confounded with one another, and what belongs to the one may 
not be ascribed to the other, whereby the merit and benefits of Christ are easily 
The Lutheran Confessions
534
obscured and the Gospel is again turned into a doctrine of the Law, as has occurred 
in the Papacy, and thus Christians are deprived of the true comfort which they 
have in the Gospel against the terrors of the Law, and the door is again opened 
in the Church of God to the Papacy, therefore the true and proper distinction 
between the Law and the Gospel must with all diligence be inculcated and 
preserved, and whatever gives occasion for confusion inter legem et evangelium 
(between the Law and the Gospel), that is, whereby the two doctrines, Law and 
Gospel, may be confounded and mingled into one doctrine, should be diligently 
prevented. It is, therefore, dangerous and wrong to convert the Gospel, properly so 
called, as distinguished from the Law, into a preaching of repentance or reproof [a 
preaching of repentance, reproving sin]. For otherwise, if understood in a general 
sense of the entire doctrine, also the Apology says several times that the Gospel is a 
preaching of repentance and the forgiveness of sins. Meanwhile, however, the Apol-
ogy also shows that the Gospel is properly the promise of the forgiveness of sins 
and of justification through Christ, but that the Law is a doctrine which reproves 
sins and condemns.
VI. The Third Use of the Law
1] Since the Law of God is useful, 1. not only to the end that external discipline 
and decency are maintained by it against wild, disobedient men; 2. likewise, that 
through it men are brought to a knowledge of their sins; 3. but also that, when they 
have been born anew by the Spirit of God, converted to the Lord, and thus the veil 
of Moses has been lifted from them, they live and walk in the law, a dissension has 
occurred between some few theologians concerning this third and last use of the 
Law. 2] For the one side taught and maintained that the regenerate do not learn the 
new obedience, or in what good works they ought to walk, from the Law, and that 
this teaching [concerning good works] is not to be urged thence [from the law], 
because they have been made free by the Son of God, have become the temples of 
His Spirit, and therefore do freely of themselves what God requires of them, by 
the prompting and impulse of the Holy Ghost, just as the sun of itself, without any 
[foreign] impulse, completes its ordinary course. 3] Over against this the other side 
taught: Although the truly believing are verily moved by God’s Spirit, and thus, 
according to the inner man, do God’s will from a free spirit, yet it is just the Holy 
Ghost who uses the written law for instruction with them, by which the truly be-
lieving also learn to serve God, not according to their own thoughts, but according 
to His written Law and Word, which is a sure rule and standard of a godly life and 
walk, how to order it in accordance with the eternal and immutable will of God.
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
535
4] For the explanation and final settlement of this dissent we unanimously believe, 
teach, and confess that although the truly believing and truly converted to God 
and justified Christians are liberated and made free from the curse of the Law, yet 
they should daily exercise themselves in the Law of the Lord, as it is written, Ps. 
1:2;119:1: Blessed is the man whose delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in His Law 
doth he meditate day and night. For the Law is a mirror in which the will of God, 
and what pleases Him, are exactly portrayed, and which should [therefore] be con-
stantly held up to the believers and be diligently urged upon them without ceasing.
5] For although the Law is not made for a righteous man, as the apostle testifies 1 
Tim. 1:9, but for the unrighteous, yet this is not to be understood in the bare mean-
ing, that the justified are to live without law. For the Law of God has been written 
in their heart, and also to the first man immediately after his creation a law was 
given according to which he was to conduct himself. But the meaning of St. Paul is 
that the Law cannot burden with its curse those who have been reconciled to God 
through Christ; nor must it vex the regenerate with its coercion, because they have 
pleasure in God’s Law after the inner man.
6] And, indeed, if the believing and elect children of God were completely renewed 
in this life by the indwelling Spirit, so that in their nature and all its powers they 
were entirely free from sin, they would need no law, and hence no one to drive 
them either, but they would do of themselves, and altogether voluntarily, without 
any instruction, admonition, urging or driving of the Law, what they are in duty 
bound to do according to God’s will; just as the sun, the moon, and all the constel-
lations of heaven have their regular course of themselves, unobstructed, without 
admonition, urging, driving, force, or compulsion, according to the order of God 
which God once appointed for them, yea, just as the holy angels render an entirely 
voluntary obedience.
7] However, believers are not renewed in this life perfectly or completely, 
completive vel consummative [as the ancients say]; for although their sin is cov-
ered by the perfect obedience of Christ, so that it is not imputed to believers for 
condemnation, and also the mortification of the old Adam and the renewal in the 
spirit of their mind is begun through the Holy Ghost, nevertheless the old Adam 
clings to them still in their nature and all its internal and external powers. 8] Of 
this the apostle has written Rom. 7:18ff.: I know that in me [that is, in my flesh] 
dwelleth no good thing. And again: For that which I do I allow not; for what I 
would, that do I not; but what I hate, that I do; Likewise: I see another law in my 
members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to 
the law of sin. Likewise, Gal. 5:17: The flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit 
The Lutheran Confessions
536
against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do 
the things that ye would.
9] Therefore, because of these lusts of the flesh the truly believing, elect, and 
regenerate children of God need in this life not only the daily instruction and 
admonition, warning, and threatening of the Law, but also frequently punishments, 
that they may be roused [the old man is driven out of them] and follow the Spirit 
of God, as it is written Ps. 119:71: It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I 
might learn Thy statutes. And again, 1 Cor. 9:27: I keep under my body and bring 
it into subjection, lest that, by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself 
should be a castaway. And again, Heb. 12:8: But if ye be without chastisement, 
whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards and not sons; as Dr. Luther has fully 
explained this at greater length in the Summer Part of the Church Postil, on the 
Epistle for the Nineteenth Sunday after Trinity.
10] But we must also explain distinctively what the Gospel does, produces, and 
works towards the new obedience of believers, and what is the office of the Law in 
this matter, as regards the good works of believers.
11] For the Law says indeed that it is God’s will and command that we should walk 
in a new life, but it does not give the power and ability to begin and do it; but 
the Holy Ghost, who is given and received, not through the Law, but through the 
preaching of the Gospel, Gal. 3:14, renews the heart. 12] Thereafter the Holy Ghost 
employs the Law so as to teach the regenerate from it, and to point out and show 
them in the Ten Commandments what is the [good and] acceptable will of God, 
Rom. 12:2, in what good works God hath before ordained that they should walk, 
Eph. 2:10. He exhorts them thereto, and when they are idle, negligent, and rebel-
lious in this matter because of the flesh, He reproves them on that account through 
the Law, so that He carries on both offices together: He slays and makes alive; He 
leads into hell and brings up again. For His office is not only to comfort, but also 
to reprove, as it is written: When the Holy Ghost is come, He will reprove the 
world (which includes also the old Adam) of sin, and of righteousness, and of judg-
ment. 13] But sin is everything that is contrary to God’s Law. 14] And St. Paul says: 
All Scripture given by inspiration of God is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, 
etc., and to reprove is the peculiar office of the Law. Therefore, as often as believers 
stumble, they are reproved by the Holy Spirit from the Law, and by the same Spirit 
are raised up and comforted again with the preaching of the Holy Gospel.
15] But in order that, as far as possible, all misunderstanding may be prevented, 
and the distinction between the works of the Law and those of the Spirit be 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
537
properly taught and preserved it is to be noted with especial diligence that when 
we speak of good works which are in accordance with God’s Law (for otherwise 
they are not good works), then the word Law has only one sense, namely, the 
immutable will of God, according to which men are to conduct themselves in their 
lives.
16] The difference, however, is in the works, because of the difference in the men 
who strive to live according to this Law and will of God. For as long as man is 
not regenerate, and [therefore] conducts himself according to the Law and does 
the works because they are commanded thus, from fear of punishment or desire 
for reward, he is still under the Law, and his works are called by St. Paul properly 
works of the Law, for they are extorted by the Law, as those of slaves; and these are 
saints after the order of Cain [that is, hypocrites].
17] But when man is born anew by the Spirit of God, and liberated from the Law, 
that is, freed from this driver, and is led by the Spirit of Christ, he lives according 
to the immutable will of God comprised in the Law, and so far as he is born anew, 
does everything from a free, cheerful spirit; and these are called not properly works 
of the Law, but works and fruits of the Spirit, or as St. Paul names it, the law of the 
mind and the Law of Christ. For such men are no more under the Law, but under 
grace, as St. Paul says, Rom. 8:2 [Rom. 7:23; 1 Cor. 9:21 ].
18] But since believers are not completely renewed in this world, but the old Adam 
clings to them even to the grave, there also remains in them the struggle between 
the spirit and the flesh. Therefore they delight indeed in God’s Law according to 
the inner man, but the law in their members struggles against the law in their 
mind; hence they are never without the Law, and nevertheless are not under, but 
in the Law, and live and walk in the Law of the Lord, and yet do nothing from 
constraint of the Law.
19] But as far as the old Adam is concerned, which still clings to them, he must 
be driven not only with the Law, but also with punishments; nevertheless he does 
everything against his will and under coercion, no less than the godless are driven 
and held in obedience by the threats of the Law, 1 Cor. 9:27; Rom. 7:18. 19.
20] So, too, this doctrine of the Law is needful for believers, in order that they may 
not hit upon a holiness and devotion of their own, and under the pretext of the 
Spirit of God set up a self-chosen worship, without God’s Word and command, as 
it is written Deut. 12:8,28,32: Ye shall not do… every man whatsoever is right in his 
own eyes, etc., but observe and hear all these words which I command thee. Thou 
shalt not add thereto, nor diminish therefrom.
The Lutheran Confessions
538
21] So, too, the doctrine of the Law, in and with [the exercise of] the good works 
of believers, is necessary for the reason that otherwise man can easily imagine that 
his work and life are entirely pure and perfect. But the Law of God prescribes to 
believers good works in this way, that it shows and indicates at the same time, as 
in a mirror, that in this life they are still imperfect and impure in us, so that we 
must say with the beloved Paul, 1 Cor. 4:4: I know nothing by myself; yet am I not 
hereby justified. Thus Paul, when exhorting the regenerate to good works, presents 
to them expressly the Ten Commandments, Rom. 13:9; and that his good works are 
imperfect and impure he recognizes from the Law, Rom. 7:7ff ; and David declares 
Ps. 119:32: Viam mandatorum tuorum cucurri, I will run the way of Thy command-
ments; but enter not into judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy sight shall no man 
living be justified, Ps. 143:2.
22] But how and why the good works of believers, although in this life they are 
imperfect and impure because of sin in the flesh, are nevertheless acceptable 
and well-pleasing to God, is not taught by the Law, which requires an altogether 
perfect, pure obedience if it is to please God. But the Gospel teaches that our 
spiritual offerings are acceptable to God through faith for Christ’s sake, 1 Pet. 2:5; 
Heb. 11:4ff. 23] In this way Christians are not under the Law, but under grace, 
because by faith in Christ the persons are freed from the curse and condemnation 
of the Law; and because their good works, although they are still imperfect and 
impure, are acceptable to God through Christ; moreover, because so far as they 
have been born anew according to the inner man, they do what is pleasing to God, 
not by coercion of the Law, but by the renewing of the Holy Ghost, voluntarily and 
spontaneously from their hearts; however, they maintain nevertheless a constant 
struggle against the old Adam.
24] For the old Adam, as an intractable, refractory ass, is still a part of them, which 
must be coerced to the obedience of Christ, not only by the teaching, admonition, 
force and threatening of the Law, but also oftentimes by the club of punishments 
and troubles, until the body of sin is entirely put off, and man is perfectly renewed 
in the resurrection, when he will need neither the preaching of the Law nor its 
threatenings and punishments, as also the Gospel any longer; for these belong to 
this [mortal and] imperfect life. 25] But as they will behold God face to face, so 
they will, through the power of the indwelling Spirit of God, do the will of God 
[the heavenly Father] with unmingled joy, voluntarily, unconstrained, without any 
hindrance, with entire purity and perfection, and will rejoice in it eternally.
26] Accordingly, we reject and condemn as an error pernicious and detrimental 
to Christian discipline, as also to true godliness, the teaching that the Law, in the 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
539
above-mentioned way and degree, should not be urged upon Christians and the 
true believers, but only upon the unbelieving, unchristians, and impenitent.
VII. The Holy Supper
1] Although, in the opinion of some, the exposition of this article perhaps should 
not be inserted into this document, in which we intend to explain the articles 
which have been drawn into controversy among the theologians of the Augsburg 
Confession (from which the Sacramentarians soon in the beginning, when the 
Confession was first composed and presented to the Emperor at Augsburg in 
1530, entirely withdrew and separated, and presented their own Confession), still, 
since some theologians, and others who boast [their adherence to] the Augsburg 
Confession, have, alas! during the last years, given their assent in this article to 
the Sacramentarians no longer secretly, but partly publicly and against their 
own conscience have endeavored to wrest forcibly and to pervert the Augsburg 
Confession as being in this article in entire harmony with the doctrine of the 
Sacramentarians, we neither can nor should omit our testimony by our confession 
of the divine truth also in this document, and must repeat the true sense and 
proper understanding of the words of Christ and of the Augsburg Confession with 
reference to this article, and [for we recognize it to be our duty], so far as in us lies, 
by God’s help, preserve it [this pure doctrine] also for posterity, and faithfully warn 
our hearers, together with other godly Christians, against this pernicious error, 
which is entirely contrary to the divine Word and the Augsburg Confession, and 
has been frequently condemned.
STATUS CONTROVERSIAE. 
The Chief Controversy between Our Doctrine and that of the Sacra-
mentarians In This Article.
2] Although some Sacramentarians strive to employ words that come as close as 
possible to the Augsburg Confession and the form and mode of speech in its [our] 
churches, and confess that in the Holy Supper the body of Christ is truly received 
by believers, still, when we insist that they state their meaning properly, sincerely, 
and clearly, they all declare themselves unanimously thus: that the true essential 
body and blood of Christ is absent from the consecrated bread and wine in the 
Holy Supper as far as the highest heaven is from the earth. For thus their own 
words run: Abesse Christi corpus et sanguinem a signis tanto intervallo dicimus, quanto 
abest terra ab altissimis coelis. That is: “We say that the body and blood of Christ are 
The Lutheran Confessions
540
as far from the signs as the earth is distant from the highest heaven.”  
3] Therefore they understand this presence of the body of Christ not as a presence 
here upon earth, but only respectu fidei (with respect to faith) [when they speak 
of the presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Supper, they do not mean 
that they are present upon earth, except with respect to faith], that is, that our 
faith, reminded and excited by the visible signs, just as by the Word preached, 
elevates itself and ascends above all heavens, and receives and enjoys the body of 
Christ, which is there in heaven present, yea, Christ Himself, together with all His 
benefits, in a manner true and essential, but nevertheless spiritual only. For [they 
hold that] as the bread and wine are here upon earth and not in heaven, so the 
body of Christ is now in heaven and not upon earth, and consequently nothing else 
is received by the mouth in the Holy Supper than bread and wine.
4] Now, originally, they alleged that the Lord’s Supper is only an external sign, by 
which Christians are known, and that nothing else is offered in it than mere bread 
and wine (which are bare signs [symbols] of the absent body of Christ). When this 
[figment] would not stand the test, they confessed that the Lord Christ is truly 
present in His Supper, namely per communicationem idiomatum (by the commu-
nication of attributes), that is, according to His divine nature alone, but not with 
His body and blood.
5] Afterwards, when they were forced by Christ’s words to confess that the body 
of Christ is present in the Supper, they still understood and declared it in no other 
way than spiritually [only of a spiritual presence], that is, of partaking through 
faith of His power, efficacy, and benefits, because [they say] through the Spirit of 
Christ, who is everywhere, our bodies, in which the Spirit of Christ dwells here 
upon earth, are united with the body of Christ, which is in heaven.
6] The consequence was that many great men were deceived by these fine, plausible 
words, when they alleged and boasted that they were of no other opinion than that 
the Lord Christ is present in His [Holy] Supper truly, essentially, and as one alive; 
but they understand this according to His divine nature alone, and not of His body 
and blood, which, they say, are now in heaven, and nowhere else, and that He gives 
us with the bread and wine His true body and blood to eat, to partake of them 
spiritually through faith, but not bodily with the mouth.
7] For they understand the words of the Supper: Eat, this is My body, not properly, 
as they read, according to the letter, but figurate, as figurative expressions, so that 
eating the body of Christ means nothing else than believing, and body is equivalent 
to symbol, that is, a sign or figure of the body of Christ, which is not in the Supper 
on earth, but only in heaven. The word is they interpret sacramentaliter seu modo 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
541
significativo (sacramentally, or in a significative manner), nequis rem cum signis ita 
putet copulari, ut Christi quoque caro nunc in terris adsit modo quodam invisibili 
et incomprehensibili (in order that no one may regard the thing so joined with 
the signs that the flesh also of Christ is now present on earth in an invisible and 
incomprehensible manner); 8] that is, that the body of Christ is united with the 
bread sacramentally, or significatively, so that believing, godly Christians as surely 
partake spiritually of the body of Christ, which is above, in heaven, as they eat the 
bread with the mouth. But that the body of Christ is present here upon earth in 
the Supper essentially, although invisibly and incomprehensibly, and is received 
orally, with the consecrated bread, even by hypocrites or those who are Christians 
only in appearance [by name] this they are accustomed to execrate and condemn as 
a horrible blasphemy.
9] Over against this it is taught in the Augsburg Confession from God’s Word con-
cerning the Lord’s Supper: That the true body and blood of Christ are truly present 
in the Holy Supper under the form of bread and wine, and are there dispensed 
and received; and the contrary doctrine is rejected (namely, that of the Sacramen-
tarians, who presented their own Confession at the same time at Augsburg, that 
the body of Christ, because He has ascended to heaven, is not truly and essentially 
present here upon earth in the Sacrament [which denied the true and substantial 
presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Sacrament of the Supper adminis-
tered on earth, namely, for the reason that Christ had ascended into heaven]); 10] 
even as this opinion is clearly expressed in Luther’s Small Catechism in the follow-
ing words: The Sacrament of the Altar is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus 
Christ under the bread and wine, for us Christians to eat and to drink, instituted by 
Christ Himself; 11] and in the Apology this is not only explained still more clearly, 
but also established by the passage from Paul, 1 Cor. 10:16, and by the testimony 
of Cyril, in the following words: The Tenth Article has been approved, in which 
we confess that in the Lord’s Supper the body and blood of Christ are truly and 
substantially present, and are truly tendered with the visible elements, bread and 
wine, to those who receive the Sacrament. For since Paul says: “The bread which we 
break is the communion of the body of Christ,” etc., it would follow, if the body of 
Christ were not, but only the Holy Ghost were truly present, that the bread is not a 
communion of the body, but of the Spirit of Christ. Besides, we know that not only 
the Romish, but also the Greek Church has taught the bodily presence of Christ 
in the Holy Supper. And testimony is produced from Cyril that Christ dwells also 
bodily in us in the Holy Supper by the communication of His flesh.
12] Afterwards, when those who at Augsburg delivered their own Confession 
concerning this article had allied themselves with the Confession of our churches 
[seemed to be willing to approve the Confession of our churches], the following 
The Lutheran Confessions
542
Formula Concordiae, that is, articles of Christian agreement, between the Saxon 
theologians and those of Upper Germany was composed and signed at Wittenberg, 
in the year 1536, by Dr. Martin Luther and other theologians on both sides:
13] We have heard how Mr. Martin Bucer explained his own opinion, and that of 
the other preachers who came with him from the cities, concerning the holy Sacra-
ment of the body and blood of Christ, namely, as follows:
14] They confess, according to the words of Irenaeus, that in this Sacrament there 
are two things, a heavenly and an earthly. Accordingly, they hold and teach that 
with the bread and wine the body and blood of Christ are truly and essentially 
present, offered, and received. And although they believe in no transubstantiation, 
that is, an essential transformation of the bread and wine into the body and blood 
of Christ, nor hold that the body and blood of Christ are included in the bread 
localiter, that is, locally, or are otherwise permanently united therewith apart from 
the use of the Sacrament, yet they concede that through the sacramental union the 
bread is the body of Christ, etc. [that when the bread is offered, the body of Christ 
is at the same time present, and is truly tendered]. 15] For apart from the use, 
when the bread is laid aside and preserved in the sacramental vessel [the pyx], or 
is carried about in the procession and exhibited, as is done in popery, they do not 
hold that the body of Christ is present.
16] Secondly, they hold that the institution of this Sacrament made by Christ is 
efficacious in Christendom [the Church], and that it does not depend upon the 
worthiness or unworthiness of the minister who offers the Sacrament, or of the 
one who receives it. Therefore, as St. Paul says, that even the unworthy partake of 
the Sacrament, they hold that also to the unworthy the body and blood of Christ 
are truly offered, and the unworthy truly receive them, if [where] the institution 
and command of the Lord Christ are observed. But such persons receive them 
to condemnation, as St. Paul says; for they misuse the holy Sacrament, because 
they receive it without true repentance and without faith. For it was instituted 
for this purpose, that it might testify that to those who truly repent and comfort 
themselves by faith in Christ the grace and benefits of Christ are here applied, and 
that they are incorporated into Christ and are washed by His blood.
17] In the following year, when the chief theologians of the Augsburg Confession 
assembled from all Germany at Smalcald, and deliberated as to what to present 
in the Council concerning this doctrine of the Church, by common consent the 
Smalcald Articles were composed by Dr. Luther and signed by all the theologians, 
jointly and severally, in which the proper and true meaning is clearly expressed 
in short, plain words, which agree most accurately with the words of Christ, and 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
543
every subterfuge and loophole is barred to 18] the Sacramentarians (who had 
interpreted [perverted] the Formula of Concord, that is, the above-mentioned 
articles of union, framed the preceding year, to their advantage, as saying that 
the body of Christ is offered with the bread in no other way than as it is offered, 
together with all His benefits, by the Word of the Gospel, and that by the 
sacramental union nothing else than the spiritual presence of the Lord Christ by 
faith is meant); 19] for they [the Smalcald Articles] declare: The bread and wine 
in the Holy Supper are the true body and blood of Jesus Christ, which are offered 
and received, not only by the godly, but also by godless Christians [those who have 
nothing Christian except the name].
20] Dr. Luther has also more amply expounded and confirmed this opinion 
from God’s Word in the Large Catechism, where it is written: What, then, is the 
Sacrament of the Altar? Answer: It is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus 
Christ, in and under the bread and wine, which we Christians are commanded 
by the Word of Christ to eat and to drink. 21] And shortly after: It is the ‘Word,’ 
I say, which makes and distinguishes this Sacrament, so that it is not mere bread 
and wine, but is, and is called. the body and blood of Christ. 22] Again: With this 
Word you can strengthen your conscience and say: If a hundred thousand devils, 
together with all fanatics, should rush forward, crying, How can bread and wine 
be the body and blood of Christ? I know that all spirits and scholars together are 
not as wise as is the Divine Majesty in His little finger. Now, here stands the Word 
of Christ: “Take, eat; this is My body. Drink ye all of this; this is the new testament 
in My blood,” etc. Here we abide, and would like to see those who will constitute 
themselves His masters, and make it different from what He has spoken. 23] It is 
true, indeed, that if you take away the Word, or regard it without the Word, you 
have nothing but mere bread and wine. But if the words remain with them, as they 
shall and must, then, in virtue of the same, it is truly the body and blood of Christ. 
For as the lips of Christ say and speak, so it is, as He can never lie or deceive.
24] Hence it is easy to reply to all manner of questions about which at the present 
time men are disturbed, as, for instance, whether a wicked priest can administer 
and distribute the Sacrament, and such like other points. For here conclude and 
reply: Even though a knave take or distribute the Sacrament, he receives the true 
Sacrament, that is, the true body and blood of Christ, just as truly as he who 
receives or administers it in the most worthy manner. For it is not founded upon 
the holiness of men, but upon the Word of God. And as no saint upon earth, yea, 
no angel in heaven, can change bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, 
so also can no one change or alter it, even though it be abused.
The Lutheran Confessions
544
25] For the Word, by which it became a sacrament and was instituted, does not 
become false because of the person or his unbelief. For He does not say: If you 
believe or are worthy, you will receive My body and blood, but: “Take, eat and 
drink; this is My body and blood”; 26] likewise: “Do this” (namely, what I now do, 
institute, give, and bid you take). That is as much as to say, No matter whether 
you be worthy or unworthy, you have here His body and blood, by virtue of these 
words which are added to the bread and wine. This mark and observe well; for 
upon these words rest all our foundation, protection, and defense against all error 
and temptation that have ever come or may yet come.
27] Thus far the Large Catechism, in which the true presence of the body and 
blood of Christ in the Holy Supper is established from God’s Word; and this [pres-
ence] is understood not only of the believing and worthy, but also of the unbeliev-
ing and unworthy.
28] But inasmuch as this highly illumined man [Dr. Luther, the hero illumined with 
unparalleled and most excellent gifts of the Holy Ghost] foresaw in the Spirit that 
after his death some would endeavor to make him suspected of having receded 
from the above-mentioned doctrine and other Christian articles, he has appended 
the following protestation to his large Confession:
29] Since I see that as time wears on, sects and errors increase, and that there is 
no end to the rage and fury of Satan, in order that henceforth during my life or 
after my death some of them may not, in future, support themselves by me, and 
falsely quote my writings to strengthen their error as the Sacramentarians and 
Anabaptists begin to do, I mean by this writing to confess my faith, point by point 
[concerning all the articles of our religion], before God and all the world, in which 
I intend to abide until my death, and therein (so help me God!) to depart from 
this world and to appear before the judgment-seat of Jesus Christ. 30] And if after 
my death any one should say: If Dr. Luther were living now, he would teach and 
hold this or that article differently, for he did not sufficiently consider it, against 
this I say now as then, and then as now, that, by God’s grace, I have most diligent-
ly, compared all these articles with the Scriptures time and again [have examined 
them, not once, but very often, according to the standard of Holy Scripture], and 
often have gone over them, and would defend them as confidently as I have now 
defended the Sacrament of the Altar. 31] I am not drunk nor thoughtless; I know 
what I say; I also am sensible of what it means for me at the coming of the Lord 
Christ at the final judgment. Therefore I want no one to regard this as a jest or 
mere idle talk; it is a serious matter to me; for by God’s grace I know Satan a good 
deal; if he can pervert or confuse God’s Word, what will he not do with my words 
or those of another? Tom. 2, Wittenb., German, fol. 243.
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
545
32] After this protestation, Doctor Luther, of blessed memory, presents, among 
other articles, this also: In the same manner I also speak and confess (he says) 
concerning the Sacrament of the Altar, that there the body and blood of Christ 
are in truth orally eaten and drunk in the bread and wine, even though the priests 
[ministers] who administer it [the Lord’s Supper], or those who receive it, should 
not believe or otherwise misuse it. For it does not depend upon the faith or unbe-
lief of men, but upon God’s Word and ordinance, unless they first change God’s 
Word and ordinance and interpret it otherwise, as the enemies of the Sacrament 
do at the present day, who, of course, have nothing but bread and wine; for they 
also do not have the words and appointed ordinance of God, but have perverted 
and changed them according to their own [false] notion. Fol. 245.
33] Dr. Luther, who, above others, certainly understood the true and proper 
meaning of the Augsburg Confession, and who constantly remained steadfast 
thereto till his end, and defended it, shortly before his death repeated his faith 
concerning this article with great zeal in his last Confession, where he writes thus: 
I rate as one concoction, namely, as Sacramentarians and fanatics, which they also 
are, all who will not believe that the Lord’s bread in the Supper is His true natural 
body, which the godless or Judas received with the mouth, as well as did St. Peter 
and all [other] saints; he who will not believe this (I say) should let me alone, and 
hope for no fellowship with me; this is not going to be altered [thus my opinion 
stands, which I am not going to change]. Tom. 2, Wittenb., German, fol. 252.
34] From these explanations, and especially from that of Dr. Luther as the leading 
teacher of the Augsburg Confession, every intelligent man who loves truth and 
peace, can undoubtedly perceive what has always been the proper meaning and 
understanding of the Augsburg Confession in regard to this article.
35] For the reason why, in addition to the expressions of Christ and St. Paul (the 
bread in the Supper is the body of Christ or the communion of the body of Christ), 
also the forms: under the bread, with the bread, in the bread [the body of Christ 
is present and offered], are employed, is that by means of them the papistical 
transubstantiation may be rejected and the sacramental union of the unchanged 
essence of the bread and of the body of Christ indicated; 36] just as the expression, 
Verbum caro factum est, The Word was made flesh [ John 1:14 ], is repeated and 
explained by the equivalent expressions: The Word dwelt among us; likewise [ Col 
2:9 ]: In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily; likewise [ Acts 10:38 ]: 
God was with Him; likewise [ 2 Cor. 5:19 ]: God was in Christ, and the like; namely, 
that the divine essence is not changed into the human nature, but the two natures, 
unchanged, are personally united. [These phrases repeat and declare the expression 
of John, above mentioned, namely, that by the incarnation the divine essence is not 
The Lutheran Confessions
546
changed into the human nature, but that the two natures without confusion are 
personally united.] 37] Even as many eminent ancient teachers, Justin, Cyprian, 
Augustine, Leo, Gelasius, Chrysostom and others, use this simile concerning the 
words of Christ’s testament: This is My body, that just as in Christ two distinct, 
unchanged natures are inseparably united, so in the Holy Supper the two substanc-
es, the natural bread and the true natural body of Christ, are present together here 
upon earth in the appointed administration of the Sacrament. 38] Although this 
union of the body and blood of Christ with the bread and wine is not a personal 
union, as that of the two natures in Christ, but as Dr. Luther and our theologians, 
in the frequently mentioned Articles of Agreement [Formula of Concord] in the 
year 1536 and in other places call it sacramentatem unionem, that is, a sacramental 
union, by which they wish to indicate that, although they also employ the formas: 
in pane, sub pane, cum pane, that is, these distinctive modes of speech: in the 
bread, under the bread, with the bread, yet they have received the words of Christ 
properly and as they read, and have understood the proposition, that is, the words 
of Christ’s testament: Hoc est corpus meum, This is My body, not as a figuratam 
propositionem, but inusitatam (that is, not as a figurative, allegorical expression or 
comment, but as an unusual expression). 39] For thus Justin says: This we receive 
not as common bread and common drink; but as Jesus Christ, our Savior, through 
the Word of God became flesh, and on account of our salvation also had flesh and 
blood, so we believe that the food blessed by Him through the Word and prayer 
is the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. 40] Likewise Dr. Luther also in his 
Large and especially in his last Confession concerning the Lord’s Supper with great 
earnestness and zeal defends the very form of expression which Christ used at the 
first Supper.
41] Now, since Dr. Luther is to be regarded as the most distinguished teacher of the 
churches which confess the Augsburg Confession, whose entire doctrine as to sum 
and substance is comprised in the articles of the frequently mentioned Augsburg 
Confession, and was presented to the Emperor Charles V, the proper meaning and 
sense of the oft-mentioned Augsburg Confession can and should be derived from 
no other source more properly and correctly than from the doctrinal and polemical 
writings of Dr. Luther.
42] And, indeed, this very opinion, just cited, is founded upon the only firm, 
immovable, and indubitable rock of truth, from the words of institution, in the 
holy, divine Word, and was thus understood, taught, and propagated by the holy 
evangelists and apostles, and their disciples and hearers.
43] For since our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, concerning whom, as our only 
Teacher, this solemn command has been given from heaven to all men: Hunc 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
547
audite, Hear ye Him, who is not a mere man or angel, neither true, wise, and 
mighty only, but the eternal Truth and Wisdom itself and Almighty God, who 
knows very well what and how He is to speak, and who also can powerfully effect 
and execute everything that He speaks and promises, as He says Luke 21:33: Heaven 
and earth shalt pass away, but My words shall not pass away; also Matt. 28:18: All 
power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth,-
44] Since, now, this true, almighty Lord, our Creator and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, 
after the Last Supper, when He is just beginning His bitter suffering and death 
for our sins, in those sad last moments, with great consideration and solemnity, 
in the institution of this most venerable Sacrament, which was to be used until 
the end of the world with great reverence and obedience [and humility], and was 
to be an abiding memorial of His bitter suffering and death and all His benefits, 
a sealing [and confirmation] of the New Testament, a consolation of all distressed 
hearts, and a firm bond of union of Christians with Christ, their Head, and with 
one another, in the ordaining and institution of the Holy Supper spake these words 
concerning the bread which He blessed and gave [to His disciples]: Take, eat; this is 
My body, which is given for you, and concerning the cup, or wine: This is My blood 
of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins;-
45] [Now, since this is so,] We are certainly in duty bound not to interpret and 
explain these words of the eternal, true, and almighty Son of God, our Lord, 
Creator, and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, differently, as allegorical, figurative, tropical 
expressions, according as it seems agreeable to our reason, but with simple faith 
and due obedience to receive the words as they read, in their proper and plain 
sense, and allow ourselves to be diverted therefrom [from this express testament 
of Christ] by no objections or human contradictions spun from human reason, 
however charming they may appear to reason.
46] Even as Abraham, when he hears God’s Word concerning offering his 
son, although, indeed, he had cause enough for disputing as to whether the 
words should be understood according to the letter or with a tolerable or mild 
interpretation, since they conflicted openly not only with all reason and with 
the divine and natural law, but also with the chief article of faith concerning the 
promised Seed, Christ, who was to be born of Isaac, nevertheless, just as previously, 
when the promise of the blessed Seed from Isaac was given him, he gave God 
the honor of truth, and most confidently concluded and believed that what God 
promised He could also do, although it appeared impossible to his reason; so also 
here he understands and believes God’s Word and command plainly and simply, as 
they read according to the letter, and commits the matter to God’s omnipotence 
The Lutheran Confessions
548
and wisdom, which, he knows, has many more modes and ways to fulfil the prom-
ise of the Seed from Isaac than he can comprehend with his blind reason;-
47] Thus we, too, are simply to believe with all humility and obedience the plain, 
firm, clear, and solemn words and command of our Creator and Redeemer, 
without any doubt and disputation as to how it agrees with our reason or is 
possible. For these words were spoken by that Lord who is infinite Wisdom and 
Truth itself, and also can execute and accomplish everything which He promises.
48] Now, all the circumstances of the institution of the Holy Supper testify that 
these words of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, which in themselves are simple, 
plain, clear, firm, and indubitable, cannot and must not be understood otherwise 
than in their usual, proper, and common signification. For since Christ gives this 
command [concerning eating His body, etc.] at the table and at supper, there is 
indeed no doubt that He speaks of real, natural bread and of natural wine, also 
of oral eating and drinking, so that there can be no metaphor, that is, a change of 
meaning, in the word bread, as though the body of Christ were a spiritual bread 
or a spiritual food of souls. 49] Likewise, also Christ Himself takes care that there 
be no metonymy either, that is, that in the same manner there be no change of 
meaning in the word body, and that He does not speak concerning a sign of His 
body, or concerning an emblem [a symbol] or figurative body, or concerning the 
virtue of His body and the benefits which He has earned by the sacrifice of His 
body [for us], but of His true, essential body, which He delivered into death for 
us, and of His true, essential blood, which He shed for us on the tree [altar] of the 
cross for the remission of sins.
50] Now, surely there is no interpreter of the words of Jesus Christ as faithful 
and sure as the Lord Christ Himself, who understands best His words and His 
heart and opinion, and who is the wisest and most knowing for expounding them; 
and here, as in the making of His last will and testament and of His everabiding 
covenant and union, as elsewhere in [presenting and confirming] all articles 
of faith, and in the institution of all other signs of the covenant and of grace 
or sacraments, as [for example] circumcision, the various offerings in the Old 
Testament and Holy Baptism, He uses not allegorical, but entirely proper, simple, 
indubitable, and clear words; and in order that no misunderstanding can occur, 
He explains them more clearly with the words: Given for you, shed for you. 51] He 
also allows His disciples to rest in the simple, proper sense, and commands them 
that they should thus teach all nations to observe what He had commanded them, 
the apostles.
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
549
52] For this reason, too, all three evangelists, Matt. 26:26; Mark 14:22; Luke 22:19, 
and St. Paul, who received the same [the institution of the Lord’s Supper] after the 
ascension of Christ [from Christ Himself], 1 Cor. 11:24, unanimously and with the 
same words and syllables repeat concerning the consecrated and distributed bread 
these distinct, clear, firm, and true words of Christ: This is My body, altogether 
in one way, without any interpretation [trope, figure] and change. Therefore there 
is no doubt that also concerning 53] the other part of the Sacrament these words 
of Luke and Paul: This cup is the new testament in My blood, can have no other 
meaning than that which St. Matthew and St. Mark give: This (namely, that which 
you orally drink out of the cup) is My blood of the new testament, whereby I estab-
lish, seal, and confirm with you men this My testament and new covenant, namely, 
the forgiveness of sins.
54] So also that repetition, confirmation, and explanation of the words of Christ 
which St. Paul makes 1 Cor. 10:16, where he writes as follows: The cup of blessing 
which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which 
we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? is to be considered with 
all diligence and seriousness [accurately], as an especially clear testimony of the 
true, essential presence and distribution of the body and blood of Christ in the 
Supper. From this we clearly learn that not only the cup which Christ blessed at 
the first Supper, and not only the bread which Christ broke and distributed, but 
also that which we break and bless, is the communion of the body and blood of 
Christ, so that all who eat this bread and drink of this cup truly receive, and are 
partakers of, the true body and blood of Christ. 55] For if the body of Christ were 
present and partaken of, not truly and essentially, but only according to its power 
and efficacy, the bread would have to be called, not a communion of the body, but 
of the Spirit, power, and benefits of Christ, as the Apology argues and concludes. 
56] And if Paul were speaking only of the spiritual communion of the body of 
Christ through faith, as the Sacramentarians pervert this passage, he would not 
say that the bread, but that the spirit or faith, was the communion of the body 
of Christ. But as he says that the bread is the communion of the body of Christ, 
that all who partake of the consecrated bread also become partakers of the body 
of Christ, he must indeed be speaking, not of a spiritual, but of a sacramental or 
oral participation of the body of Christ, which is common to godly and godless 
Christians [Christians only in name].
57] This is shown also by the causes and circumstances of this entire exposition of 
St. Paul, in which he deters and warns those who ate of offerings to idols and had 
fellowship with heathen devil-worship, and nevertheless went also to the table of 
the Lord and became partakers of the body and blood of Christ, lest they receive 
the body and blood of Christ for judgment and condemnation to themselves. For 
since all those who become partakers of the consecrated and broken bread in the 
The Lutheran Confessions
550
Supper have communion also with the body of Christ, St. Paul indeed cannot 
be speaking of spiritual communion with Christ, which no man can abuse, and 
against which also no one is to be warned.
58] Therefore also our dear fathers and predecessors, as Luther and other pure 
teachers of the Augsburg Confession, explain this statement of Paul with such 
words that it accords most fully with the words of Christ when they write thus: 
The bread which we break is the distributed body of Christ, or the common 
[communicated] body of Christ, distributed to those who receive the broken bread.
59] By this simple, well-founded exposition of this glorious testimony, 1 Cor. 10, 
we unanimously abide, and we are justly astonished that some are so bold as to 
venture now to cite this passage, which they themselves previously opposed to the 
Sacramentarians, as a foundation for their error, that in the Supper the body of 
Christ is partaken of spiritually only. [For thus they speak]: Panis est communi-
catio corporis Christi, hoc est, id, quo fit societas cum corpore Christi (quod est 
ecclesia), seu est medium, per quod fideles unimur Christo, sicut verbum evangelii 
fide apprehensum est medium, per quod Christo spiritualiter unimur et corpori 
Christi, quod est ecclesia, inserimur. Translated, this reads as follows: “The bread is 
the communion of the body of Christ, that is, it is that by which we have fellow-
ship with the body of Christ, which is the Church, or it is the means by which we 
believers are united with Christ, just as the Word of the Gospel, apprehended by 
faith, is a means through which we are spiritually united to Christ and incorporat-
ed into the body of Christ, which is the Church.”
60] For that not only the godly, pious, and believing Christians, but also unworthy, 
godless hypocrites, as Judas and his ilk, who have no spiritual communion with 
Christ, and go to the Table of the Lord without true repentance and conversion to 
God, also receive orally in the Sacrament the true body and [true] blood of Christ, 
and by their unworthy eating and drinking grievously sin against the body and 
blood of Christ, St. Paul teaches expressly. For he says, 1 Cor. 11:27: Whosoever shall 
eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, sins not merely against 
the bread and wine, not merely against the signs or symbols and emblems of the 
body and blood, but shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
which, as there [in the Holy Supper] present, he dishonors, abuses, and disgraces, as 
the Jews, who in very deed violated the body of Christ and killed Him; just as the 
ancient Christian Fathers and church-teachers unanimously have understood and 
explained this passage.
61] There is, therefore, a two-fold eating of the flesh of Christ, one spiritual, of 
which Christ treats especially John 6:54, which occurs in no other way than with 
the Spirit and faith, in the preaching and meditation of the Gospel, as well as in 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
551
the Lord’s Supper, and by itself is useful and salutary, and necessary at all times for 
salvation to all Christians; without which spiritual participation also the sacra-
mental or oral eating in the Supper is not only not salutary, but even injurious and 
damning [a cause of condemnation].
62] But this spiritual eating is nothing else than faith, namely, to hear God’s Word 
(wherein Christ, true God and man, is presented to us, together with all bene-
fits which He has purchased for us by His flesh given into death for us, and by 
His blood shed for us, namely, God’s grace, the forgiveness of sins, righteousness, 
and eternal life), to receive it with faith and appropriate it to ourselves, and in 
all troubles and temptations firmly to rely, with sure confidence and trust, and 
to abide in the consolation that we have a gracious God, and eternal salvation 
on account of the Lord Jesus Christ. [He who hears these things related from the 
Word of God, and in faith receives and applies; them to himself, and relies entirely 
upon this consolation (that we have God reconciled and life eternal on account of 
the Mediator, Jesus Christ),–he, I say, who with true confidence rests in the Word 
of the Gospel in all troubles and temptations, spiritually eats the body of Christ 
and drinks His blood.]
63] The other eating of the body of Christ is oral or sacramental, when the true, 
essential body and blood of Christ are also orally received and partaken of in 
the Holy Supper, by all who eat and drink the consecrated bread and wine in 
the Supper-by the believing as a certain pledge and assurance that their sins 
are surely forgiven them, and Christ dwells and is efficacious in them, but by 
the unbelieving for their judgment and condemnation, 64] as the words of the 
institution by Christ expressly declare, when at the table and during the Supper 
He offers His disciples natural bread and natural wine, which He calls His true 
body and true blood, at the same time saying: Eat and drink. For in view of the 
circumstances this command evidently cannot be understood otherwise than of 
oral eating and drinking, however, not in a gross, carnal, Capernaitic, but in a 
supernatural, incomprehensible way; 65] to which afterwards the other command 
adds still another and spiritual eating, when the Lord Christ says further: This do 
in remembrance of Me, where He requires faith [which is the spiritual partaking of 
Christ’s body).
66] Therefore all the ancient Christian teachers expressly, and in full accord 
with the entire holy Christian Church, teach, according to these words of the 
institution of Christ and the explanation of St. Paul, that the body of Christ is 
not only received spiritually by faith, which occurs also outside of [the use of] the 
Sacrament, but also orally, not only by believing and godly, but also by unworthy, 
unbelieving, false, and wicked Christians. As this is too long to be narrated 
The Lutheran Confessions
552
here, we would, for the sake of brevity, have the Christian reader referred to the 
exhaustive writings of our theologians.
67] Hence it is manifest how unjustly and maliciously the Sacramentarian fanatics 
(Theodore Beza) deride the Lord Christ, St. Paul, and the entire Church in 
calling this oral partaking, and that of the unworthy, duos pilos caudae equinae 
et commentum, cuius vel ipsum Satanam pudeat, as also the doctrine concerning 
the majesty of Christ, excrementum Satanae, quo diabolus sibi ipsi et hominibus 
illudat, that is, they speak so horribly of it that a godly Christian man should be 
ashamed to translate it.
68] But it must [also] be carefully explained who are the unworthy guests of this 
Supper, namely, those who go to this Sacrament without true repentance and 
sorrow for their sins, and without true faith and the good intention of amending 
their lives, and by their unworthy oral eating of the body of Christ load themselves 
with damnation, that is, with temporal and eternal punishments, and become 
guilty of the body and blood of Christ.
69] For Christians who are of weak faith, diffident, troubled, and heartily terrified 
because of the greatness and number of their sins, and think that in this their great 
impurity they are not worthy of this precious treasure and the benefits of Christ, 
and who feel and lament their weakness of faith, and from their hearts desire that 
they may serve God with stronger, more joyful faith and pure obedience, they are 
the truly worthy guests for whom this highly venerable Sacrament [and sacred 
feast] has been especially instituted and appointed; 70] as Christ says, Matt. 11:28: 
Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Also 
Matt. 9:12: They that be whole need not a physician, but they that be sick. Also [ 
2 Cor. 12:9 ]: God’s strength is made perfect in weakness. Also [ Rom. 14:1 ]: Him 
that is weak in the faith receive ye [ Rom 14:3 ], for God hath received him. For 
whosoever believeth in the Son of God, be it with a strong or with a weak faith, 
has eternal life [ John 3:15f. ].
71] And worthiness does not depend upon great or small weakness or strength 
of faith, but upon the merit of Christ, which the distressed father of little faith [ 
Mark 9:24 ] enjoyed as well as Abraham, Paul, and others who have a joyful and 
strong faith.
72] Let the foregoing be said of the true presence and two-fold participation of the 
body and blood of Christ, which occurs either by faith, spiritually, or also orally, 
both by worthy and unworthy [which latter is common to worthy and unworthy].
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
553
73] Since a misunderstanding and dissension among some teachers of the 
Augsburg Confession also has occurred concerning consecration and the common 
rule, that nothing is a sacrament without the appointed use [or divinely instituted 
act], we have made a fraternal and unanimous declaration to one another also 
concerning this matter to the following purport, 74] namely, that not the word 
or work of any man produces the true presence of the body and blood of Christ 
in the Supper, whether it be the merit or recitation of the minister, or the eating 
and drinking or faith of the communicants; but all this should be ascribed alone to 
the power of Almighty God and the word, institution, and ordination of our Lord 
Jesus Christ.
75] For the true and almighty words of Jesus Christ which He spake at the first 
institution were efficacious not only at the first Supper, but they endure, are 
valid, operate, and are still efficacious [their force, power, and efficacy endure 
and avail even to the present], so that in all places where the Supper is celebrated 
according to the institution of Christ, and His words are used, the body and 
blood of Christ are truly present, distributed, and received, because of the power 
and efficacy of the words which Christ spake at the first Supper. For where His 
institution is observed and His words are spoken over the bread and cup [wine], 
and the consecrated bread and cup [wine] are distributed, Christ Himself, through 
the spoken words, is still efficacious by virtue of the first institution, through His 
word, which He wishes to be there repeated. 76] As Chrysostom says (in Serm. de 
Pass.) in his Sermon concerning the Passion: Christ Himself prepared this table 
and blesses it; for no man makes the bread and wine set before us the body and 
blood of Christ, but Christ Himself who was crucified for us. The words are spoken 
by the mouth of the priest, but by God’s power and grace, by the word, where He 
speaks: “This is My body,” the elements presented are consecrated in the Supper. 
And just as the declaration, Gen. 1:28: “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the 
earth,” was spoken only once, but is ever efficacious in nature, so that it is fruitful 
and multiplies, so also this declaration [“This is My body; this is My blood”] was 
spoken once, but even to this day and to His advent it is efficacious, and works so 
that in the Supper of the Church His true body and blood are present.
77] Luther also [writes concerning this very subject in the same manner], Tom. VI, 
Jena, Fol. 99: This His command and institution have this power and effect that 
we administer and receive not mere bread and wine, but His body and blood, as 
His words declare: “This is My body,” etc.; “This is My blood,” etc., so that it is not 
our work or speaking, but the command and ordination of Christ that makes the 
bread the body, and the wine the blood, from the beginning of the first Supper 
even to the end of the world, and that through our service and office they are daily 
distributed.
The Lutheran Confessions
554
78] Also, Tom. III, Jena, Fol. 446: Thus here also, even though I should pronounce 
over all bread the words: This is Christ’s body, nothing, of course, would result 
therefrom; but when in the Supper we say, according to His institution and com-
mand: “This is My body,” it is His body, not on account of our speaking or word 
uttered [because these words, when uttered, have this efficacy], but because of His 
command-that He has commanded us thus to speak and to do, and has united His 
command and act with our speaking.
79] Now, in the administration of the Holy Supper the words of institution are 
to be publicly spoken or sung before the congregation distinctly and clearly, and 
should in no way be omitted [and this for very many and the most important 
reasons. 80] First,] in order that obedience may be rendered to the command of 
Christ: This do [that therefore should not be omitted which Christ Himself did in 
the Holy Supper], 81] and [secondly] that the faith of the hearers concerning the 
nature and fruit of this Sacrament (concerning the presence of the body and blood 
of Christ, concerning the forgiveness of sins, and all benefits which have been 
purchased by the death and shedding of the blood of Christ, and are bestowed 
upon us in Christ’s testament) may be excited, strengthened, and confirmed by 
Christ’s Word, 82] and [besides] that the elements of bread and wine may be 
consecrated or blessed for this holy use, in order that the body and blood of Christ 
may therewith be administered to us to be eaten and to be drunk, as Paul declares 
[ 1 Cor. 10:16 ]: The cup of blessing which we bless, which indeed occurs in no other 
way than through the repetition and recitation of the words of institution.
83] However, this blessing, or the recitation of the words of institution of 
Christ alone does not make a sacrament if the entire action of the Supper, as 
it was instituted by Christ, is not observed (as when the consecrated bread is 
not distributed, received, and partaken of, but is enclosed, sacrificed, or carried 
about), but the command of Christ, This do (which embraces the entire action or 
administration in this Sacrament, 84] that in an assembly of Christians bread and 
wine are taken, consecrated, distributed, received, eaten, drunk, and the Lord’s 
death is shown forth at the same time) must be observed unseparated and invi-
olate, as also St. Paul places before our eyes the entire action of the breaking of 
bread or of distribution and reception, 1 Cor. 10:16.
85] [Let us now come also to the second point, of which mention was made a little 
before.] To preserve this true Christian doctrine concerning the Holy Supper, and 
to avoid and abolish manifold idolatrous abuses and perversions of this testament, 
the following useful rule and standard has been derived from the words of institu-
tion: Nihil habet rationem sacramenti extra usum a Christo institutum (“Nothing 
has the nature of a sacrament apart from the use instituted by Christ”) or extra 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
555
actionem divinitus institutam (“apart from the action divinely instituted”). That 
is: If the institution of Christ be not observed as He appointed it, there is no 
sacrament. This is by no means to be rejected, but can and should be urged and 
maintained with profit in the Church of God. 86] And the use or action here does 
not mean chiefly faith, neither the oral participation only, but the entire external, 
visible action of the Lord’s Supper instituted by Christ, [to this indeed is required] 
the consecration, or words of institution, the distribution and reception, or oral 
partaking [manducation] of the consecrated bread and wine, [likewise the partak-
ing] of the body and blood of Christ. 87] And apart from this use, when in the 
papistic mass the bread is not distributed, but offered up or enclosed, borne about, 
and exhibited for adoration, it is to be regarded as no sacrament; just as the water 
of baptism, when used to consecrate bells or to cure leprosy, or otherwise exhibited 
for worship, is no sacrament or baptism. For against such papistic abuses this rule 
has been set up at the beginning [of the reviving Gospel], and has been explained 
by Dr. Luther himself, Tom. IV, Jena.
88] Meanwhile, however, we must call attention also to this, that the 
Sacramentarians artfully and wickedly pervert this useful and necessary rule, in 
order to deny the true, essential presence and oral partaking of the body of Christ, 
which occurs here upon earth alike by the worthy and the unworthy, and interpret 
it as referring to the usus fidei, that is, to the spiritual and inner use of faith, as 
though it were no sacrament to the unworthy, and the partaking of the body 
occurred only spiritually, through faith, or as though faith made the body of Christ 
present in the Holy Supper, and therefore unworthy, unbelieving hypocrites did 
not receive the body of Christ as being present.
89] Now, it is not our faith that makes the sacrament, but only the true word 
and institution of our almighty God and Savior Jesus Christ, which always is and 
remains efficacious in the Christian Church, and is not invalidated or rendered 
inefficacious by the worthiness or unworthiness of the minister, nor by the 
unbelief of the one who receives it. Just as the Gospel, even though godless hearers 
do not believe it, yet is and remains none the less the true Gospel, only it does not 
work for salvation in the unbelieving; so, whether those who receive the Sacrament 
believe or do not believe, Christ remains none the less true in His words when He 
says: Take, eat: this is My body, and effects this [His presence] not by our faith, but 
by His omnipotence.
90] Accordingly, it is a pernicious, shameless error that some from a cunning 
perversion of this familiar rule ascribe more to our faith, which [in their opinion] 
alone renders present and partakes of the body of Christ, than to the omnipotence 
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
The Lutheran Confessions
556
91] Now, as regards the various imaginary reasons and futile counter-arguments 
of the Sacramentarians concerning the essential and natural attributes of a human 
body, concerning the ascension of Christ, concerning His departure from this 
world, and such like, inasmuch as these have one and all been refuted thoroughly 
and in detail, from God’s Word, by Dr. Luther in his controversial writings: 
Against the Heavenly Prophets, That These Words, “This Is My Body,” Still Stand 
Firm; likewise in his Large and his Small Confession concerning the Holy Supper 
[published some years afterwards], and in other of his writings, and inasmuch as 
since his death nothing new has been advanced by the factious spirits, we would 
for the sake of brevity have the Christian reader directed to them and have referred 
to them.
92] For that we neither will, nor can, nor should allow ourselves to be led away 
by thoughts of human wisdom, whatever outward appearance or authority they 
may have, from the simple, distinct, and clear sense of the Word and testament 
of Christ to a strange opinion, other than the words read, but that, in accordance 
with what is above stated, we understand and believe them simply, our reasons 
upon which we have rested in this matter ever since the controversy concerning 
93] this article arose, are those which Dr. Luther himself, in the very beginning, 
presented against the Sacramentarians in the following words (Dr. Luther in his 
Large Confession concerning the Holy Supper): My reasons upon which I rest in 
this matter are the following:
94] 1. The first is this article of our faith: Jesus Christ is essential, natural, true, 
perfect God and man in one person, inseparable and undivided.
95] 2. The second, that God’s right hand is everywhere.
96] 3. The third, that God’s Word is not false, nor does it lie.
97] 4. The fourth, that God has and knows of many modes of being in any place, 
and not only the single one concerning which the fanatics talk flippantly, and 
which philosophers call localem, or local.
98] Also: The one body of Christ [says Luther] has a threefold mode or all three 
modes of being anywhere.
99] First, the comprehensible, bodily mode, as He went about bodily upon earth, 
when, according to His size, He vacated and occupied space [was circumscribed 
by a fixed place]. This mode He can still use whenever He will, as He did after the 
resurrection, and will use at the last day, as Paul says, 1 Tim. 6:15: “Which in His 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
557
times He shall show, who is the blessed God [and only Potentate, the King of kings 
and Lord of lords].” And to the Colossians, 3:4: “When Christ, who is our Life, shall 
appear.” In this manner He is not in God or with the Father, neither in heaven, as 
the mad spirits dream; for God is not a bodily space or place. And this is what the 
passages how Christ leaves the world and goes to the Father refer to which the false 
spirits cite.
100] Secondly, the incomprehensible, spiritual mode, according to which He 
neither occupies nor vacates space, but penetrates all creatures wherever He pleases 
[according to His most free will]; as, to make an imperfect comparison, my sight 
penetrates and is in air, light, or water, and does not occupy or vacate space; as a 
sound or tone penetrates and is in air or water or board and wall, and also does not 
occupy or vacate space; likewise, as light and heat penetrate and are in air, water, 
glass, crystal, and the like, and also do not vacate or occupy space; and much more 
of the like [many comparisons of this matter could be adduced]. This mode He 
used when He rose from the closed [and sealed] sepulcher, and passed through the 
closed door [to His disciples], and in the bread and wine in the Holy Supper, and, 
as it is believed, when He was born of His mother [the most holy Virgin Mary].
101] Thirdly, the divine, heavenly mode, since He is one person with God, 
according to which, of course, all creatures must be far more penetrable and 
present to Him than they are according to the second mode. For if, according to 
that second mode, He can be in and with creatures in such a manner that they do 
not feel, touch, circumscribe, or comprehend Him, how much more wonderfully 
will He be in all creatures according to this sublime third mode, so that they do 
not circumscribe nor comprehend Him, but rather that He has them present 
before Himself, circumscribes and comprehends them! For you must place this 
being of Christ, who is one person with God [for you must place this mode of 
presence of Christ which He has by His personal union with God], very far, far 
outside of the creatures, as far as God is outside of them; and again as deep and 
near within all creatures as God is within them. For He is one inseparable person 
with God; where God is, there must He also be, 102] or our faith is false. But who 
will say or think how this occurs? We know indeed that it is so, that He is in God 
outside of all creatures, and one person with God, but how it occurs we do not 
know; it [this mystery] is above nature and reason, even above the reason of all 
the angels in heaven; it is understood and known only by God. Now, since it is 
unknown to us, and yet true, we should not deny His words before we know how 
to prove to a certainty that the body of Christ can by no means be where God is, 
and that this mode of being [presence] is false. This the fanatics must prove; but 
they will forego it.
The Lutheran Confessions
558
103] Now, whether God has and knows still more modes in which Christ’s body is 
anywhere, I did not intend to deny herewith, but to indicate what awkward dolts 
our fanatics are, that they concede to the body of Christ no more than the first, 
comprehensible mode; although they cannot even prove that to be conflicting with 
our meaning. For in no way will I deny that the power of God may accomplish 
this much that a body might be in many places at the same time, even in a bodily, 
comprehensible way. For who will prove that this is impossible with God? Who has 
seen an end to His power? The fanatics indeed think thus: God cannot do it. But 
who will believe their thinking? With what do they make such thinking sure? Thus 
far Luther.
104] From these words of Dr. Luther this, too, is clear in what sense the word 
spiritual is employed in our churches with reference to this matter. For to 
the Sacramentarians this word spiritual means nothing else than the spiritual 
communion, when through faith true believers are in the Spirit incorporated into 
Christ, the Lord, and become true spiritual members of His body.
105] But when Dr. Luther or we employ this word spiritual in regard to this 
matter, we understand by it the spiritual, supernatural, heavenly mode, according 
to which Christ is present in the Holy Supper, working not only consolation and 
life in the believing, but also condemnation in the unbelieving; whereby we reject 
the Capernaitic thoughts of the gross [and] carnal presence which is ascribed to 
and forced upon our churches by the Sacramentarians against our manifold public 
protestations. In this sense we also say [wish the word spiritually to be understood 
when we say] that in the Holy Supper the body and blood of Christ are spiritually 
received, eaten, and drunk, although this participation occurs with the mouth, 
while the mode is spiritual.
106] Thus our faith in this article concerning the true presence of the body and 
blood of Christ in the Holy Supper is based upon the truth and omnipotence of 
the true, almighty God, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. These foundations are 
strong and firm enough to strengthen and establish our faith in all temptations 
concerning this article, and, on the contrary, to overthrow and refute all the 
counter-arguments and objections of the Sacramentarians, however agreeable and 
plausible they may be to our reason; and upon them a Christian heart also can 
securely and firmly rest and rely.
107] Accordingly, with heart and mouth we reject and condemn as false, 
erroneous, and misleading all errors which are not in accordance with, but 
contrary and opposed to, the doctrine above mentioned and founded upon God’s 
Word, such as,
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
559
108] 1. The papistic transubstantiation, when it is taught that the consecrated 
or blessed bread and wine in the Holy Supper lose entirely their substance and 
essence, and are changed into the substance of the body and blood of Christ in 
such a way that only the mere form of bread and wine is left, or accidentia sine 
subiecto (the accidents without the object); under which form of the bread, which 
nevertheless is bread no longer, but according to their assertion has lost its natural 
essence, the body of Christ is present even apart from the administration of the 
Holy Supper, when the bread is enclosed in the pyx or is carried about for display 
and adoration. For nothing can be a sacrament without God’s command and the 
appointed use for which it is instituted in God’s Word, as was shown above.
109] 2. We likewise reject and condemn all other papistic abuses of this Sacrament, 
as the abomination of the sacrifice of the mass for the living and dead.
110] 3. Also, that contrary to the public command and institution of Christ only 
one form of the Sacrament is administered to the laity; as these papistic abuses 
have been thoroughly refuted by means of God’s Word and the testimonies of the 
ancient Church, in the common Confession and the Apology of our churches, the 
Smalcald Articles, and other writings of our theologians.
111] However, since we have undertaken in this document to present especially 
only our confession and explanation concerning the true presence of the body and 
blood of Christ against the Sacramentarians, some of whom shamelessly insinuate 
themselves into our churches under the name of the Augsburg Confession, we will 
also state and enumerate here especially the errors of the Sacramentarians, in order 
to warn our hearers to guard against and look out for them.
112] Accordingly, with heart and mouth we reject and condemn as false, erroneous, 
and misleading all Sacramentarian opiniones (opinions) and doctrines which are 
not in accordance with, but contrary and opposed to, the doctrine above presented 
and founded upon God’s Word:
113] 1. As when they assert that the words of institution are not to be understood 
simply in their proper signification, as they read, of the true, essential presence 
of the body and blood of Christ in the Supper, but are to be wrested, by means 
of tropi (tropes) or figurative interpretations, to another new, strange sense. We 
hereby reject all such Sacramentarian opiniones (opinions) and self-contradictory 
notions [of which some even conflict with each other], however manifold and 
various they may be.
The Lutheran Confessions
560
114] 2. Also, that the oral participation of the body and blood of Christ in the 
Supper is denied [by the Sacramentarians], and it is taught, on the contrary, that 
the body of Christ in the Supper is partaken of only spiritually by faith, so that in 
the Supper our mouth receives only bread and wine.
115] 3. Likewise, also, when it is taught that bread and wine in the Supper should 
be regarded as nothing more than tokens by which Christians are to recognize one 
another; or,
4. That they are only figures, similitudes, and representations (symbols, types] of 
the far-absent body of Christ, in such a manner that just as bread and wine are the 
outward food of our body, so also the absent body of Christ, with His merit, is the 
spiritual food of our souls.
116] 5. Or that they are no more than tokens or memorials of the absent body of 
Christ, by which signs, as an external pledge, we should be assured that the faith 
which turns from the Supper and ascends beyond all heavens and there above 
becomes as truly participant of the body and blood of Christ as we truly receive 
with the mouth the external signs in the Supper; and that thus the assurance and 
confirmation of our faith occur in the Supper only through the external signs, and 
not through the true, present body and blood of Christ offered to us.
117] 6. Or that in the Supper the power, efficacy, and merit of the far-absent 
body of Christ are distributed only to faith, and we thus become partakers of His 
absent body; and that, in this way just mentioned, unio sacramentalis, that is, the 
sacramental union, is to be understood de analogia signi et signati (with respect to 
the analogy of the sign and that which is signified), that is, as [far as] the bread and 
wine have a resemblance to the body and blood of Christ.
118] 7. Or that the body and blood of Christ cannot be received and partaken of 
otherwise than only spiritually, by faith.
119] 8. Likewise, when it is taught that because of His ascension into heaven Christ 
is so enclosed and circumscribed with His body in a definite place in heaven that 
with the same [His body] He cannot or will not be truly present with us in the 
Supper, which is celebrated according to the institution of Christ upon earth, but 
that He is as far and remote from it as heaven and earth are from one another, as 
some Sacramentarians have wilfully and wickedly falsified the text, Acts 3:21; opor-
tet Christum coelum accipere, that is, Christ must occupy heaven, for the confir-
mation of their error, and instead thereof have rendered it: oportet Christum coelo 
capi, that is, Christ must be received or be circumscribed and enclosed by heaven 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
561
or in heaven, in such a manner that in His human nature He can or will in no way 
be with us upon earth.
120] 9. Likewise, that Christ has not promised the true, essential presence of His 
body and blood in His Supper, and that He neither can nor will afford it, because 
the nature and property of His assumed human nature could not suffer or admit of 
it.
121] 10. Likewise, when it is taught that not only the Word and omnipotence of 
Christ, but faith, renders the body of Christ present in the Supper; on this account 
the words of institution in the administration of the Supper are omitted by some. 
For although the papistic consecration is justly rebuked and rejected, in which the 
power to produce a sacrament is ascribed to the speaking as the work of the priest, 
yet the words of institution can or should in no way be omitted in the administra-
tion of the Supper, as is shown in the preceding declaration.
122] 11. Likewise, that believers are not to seek, by reason of the words of Christ’s 
institution, the body of Christ with the bread and wine of the Supper, but are 
directed with their faith away from the bread of the Supper to heaven, to the place 
where the Lord Christ is with His body, that they should become partakers of it 
there.
123] 12. We reject also the teaching that unbelieving and impenitent, wicked 
Christians, who only bear the name of Christ, but do not have the right, true, 
living, and saving faith, receive in the Supper not the body and blood of Christ, 
but only bread and wine. And since there are only two kinds of guests found at this 
heavenly meal, the worthy and the unworthy, we reject also the distinction made 
among the unworthy [made by some who assert] that the godless Epicureans and 
scoffers at God’s Word, who are in the external fellowship of the Church, when 
using the Holy Supper, do not receive the body and blood of Christ for condemna-
tion, but only bread and wine.
124] 13. So, too, the teaching that worthiness consists not only in true faith, but in 
man’s own preparation.
125] 14. Likewise, the teaching that even true believers, who have and keep a right, 
true, living faith, and yet lack the said sufficient preparation of their own, could, 
just as the unworthy guests, receive this Sacrament to condemnation.
126] 15. Likewise, when it is taught that the elements or the visible species or forms 
of the consecrated bread and wine must be adored. However, no one, unless he be 
The Lutheran Confessions
562
an Arian heretic, can and will deny that Christ Himself, true God and man, who is 
truly and essentially present in the Supper, should be adored in spirit and in truth 
in the true use of the same, as also in all other places, especially where His congre-
gation is assembled.
127] 16. We reject and condemn also all presumptuous, frivolous [sarcastically 
colored], blasphemous questions and expressions which are presented in a gross, 
carnal, Capernaitic way regarding the supernatural, heavenly mysteries of this 
Supper.
128] Other and additional antitheses, or rejected contrary doctrines, have been 
reproved and rejected in the preceding explanation, which, for the sake of brevity, 
we will not repeat here, and whatever other condemnable opiniones or erroneous 
opinions there may be still, over and above the foregoing, can be easily gathered 
and named from the preceding explanation; for we reject and condemn everything 
that is not in accordance with, but contrary and opposed to, the doctrine recorded 
above and thoroughly grounded in God’s Word.
VIII. The Person of Christ
1] A controversy has also occurred among the theologians of the Augsburg 
Confession concerning the Person of Christ, which, however, did not first arise 
among them but sprang originally from the Sacramentarians [for which the 
Sacramentarians furnished the occasion].
2] For when Dr. Luther, in opposition to the Sacramentarians, had maintained the 
true, essential presence of the body and blood of Christ in the Supper with solid 
arguments from the words of institution, the objection was urged against him by 
the Zwinglians that, if the body of Christ were present at the same time in heaven 
and on earth in the Holy Supper, it could be no real, true human body; for such 
majesty was said to be peculiar to God alone, and the body of Christ not capable 
of it.
3] But while Dr. Luther contradicted and effectually refuted this, as his doctrinal 
and polemical writings concerning the Holy Supper show, which we hereby 
publicly confess [approve], as well as his doctrinal writings [and we wish this fact 
to be publicly attested], 4] some theologians of the Augsburg Confession after his 
death sought, though still unwilling to do so publicly and expressly, to confess 
themselves in agreement with the Sacramentarians concerning the Lord’s Supper; 
nevertheless they introduced and employed precisely the same false arguments 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
563
concerning the person of Christ whereby the Sacramentarians dared to remove the 
true, essential presence of the body and blood of Christ from His Supper, namely, 
that nothing should be ascribed to the human nature in the person of Christ which 
is above or contrary to its natural, essential property; and on this account they 
have loaded the doctrine of Dr. Luther, and all those who follow it as in conformity 
with God’s Word, with the charge of almost all the ancient monstrous heresies.
5] To explain this controversy in a Christian way, in conformity with God’s Word, 
according to the guidance [analogy] of our simple Christian faith, and by God’s 
grace entirely to settle it, our unanimous doctrine, faith, and confession are as 
follows:
6] We believe, teach, and confess that the Son of God, although from eternity He 
has been a particular, distinct, entire divine person, and thus, with the Father and 
the Holy Ghost, true, essential, perfect God, nevertheless, in the fulness of time 
assumed also human nature into the unity of His person, not in such a way that 
there now are two persons or two Christs, but that Christ Jesus is now in one 
person at the same time true, eternal God, born of the Father from eternity, and 
a true man, born of the most blessed Virgin Mary, as it is written Rom. 9:5: Of 
whom, as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever.
7] We believe, teach, and confess that now, in this one undivided person of Christ, 
there are two distinct natures, the divine, which is from eternity, and the human, 
which in time was assumed into the unity of the person of the Son of God; which 
two natures in the person of Christ are never either separated from, or mingled 
with, one another, or changed the one into the other, but each abides in its nature 
and essence in the person of Christ to all eternity.
8] We believe, teach, and confess also that, as both natures mentioned remain 
unmingled and undestroyed in their nature and essence, each retains also its 
natural, essential properties, and does not lay them aside to all eternity, neither do 
the essential properties of the one nature ever become the essential properties of 
the other nature.
9] Accordingly, we believe, teach, and confess that to be almighty, eternal, infinite, 
to be of itself everywhere present at once naturally, that is, according to the 
property of its nature and its natural essence, and to know all things, are essential 
attributes of the divine nature, which never to eternity become essential properties 
of the human nature.
The Lutheran Confessions
564
10] On the other hand, to be a corporeal creature, to be flesh and blood, to be 
finite and circumscribed, to suffer, to die, to ascend and descend, to move from 
one place to another, to suffer hunger, thirst, cold, heat, and the like, are properties 
of the human nature, which never become properties of the divine nature.
11] We believe, teach, and confess also that now, since the incarnation, each nature 
in Christ does not so subsist of itself that each is or constitutes a separate person, 
but that they are so united that they constitute one single person, in which the 
divine and the assumed human nature are and subsist at the same time, so that 
now, since the incarnation, there belongs to the entire person of Christ personally, 
not only His divine, but also His assumed human nature; and that, as without His 
divinity, so also without His humanity, the person of Christ or Filii Dei incarnati 
(of the incarnate Son of God), that is, of the Son of God who has assumed flesh and 
become man, is not entire. Hence Christ is not two distinct persons, but one single 
person, notwithstanding that two distinct natures are found in Him, unconfused 
in their natural essence and properties.
12] We believe, teach, and confess also that the assumed human nature in Christ 
not only has and retains its natural, essential properties, but that over and 
above these, through the personal union with the Deity, and afterwards through 
glorification, it has been exalted to the right hand of majesty, power, and might, 
over everything that can be named, not only in this world, but also in that which is 
to come [ Eph. 1:21 ].
13] Now as regards this majesty, to which Christ has been exalted according to His 
humanity, He did not first receive it when He arose from the dead and ascended 
into heaven, but when He was conceived in His mother’s womb and became man, 
and the divine and human natures were personally united with one another. 14] 
However, this personal union is not to be understood, as some incorrectly explain 
it, as though the two natures, the divine and the human, were united with one 
another, as two boards are glued together, so that they realiter, that is, in deed and 
truth, have no communion whatever with one another. 15] For this was the error 
and heresy of Nestorius and Samosatenus, who, as Suidas and Theodore, presbyter 
of Raithu, testify, taught and held: duvo fuvsei” ajkoinwnhvtou” prov” eJauta;” pan-
tavpasin, hoc est, naturas omni modo incommunicables esse, that is, that the two 
natures have no communion whatever with one another. Thereby the natures are 
separated from one another, and thus two Christs are constituted, so that Christ is 
one, and God the Word, who dwells in Christ, another.
16] For thus Theodore the Presbyter writes: Paulus quidam iisdem, quibus Manes 
temporibus, Samosatenus quidem ortu, sed Antiochiae Syriae antistes, Dominum 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
565
impie dixit nudum fuisse hominem, in quo Deus Verbum sicut et in singulis prophetis 
habitavit [habitaverit], ac proinde duas naturas separatas et citra omnem prorsus inter se 
communionem in Christo esse, quasi alius sit Christus, alius Deus Verbum in ipso habitans. 
That is: At the same time in which also the heretic Manes lived, one by the name 
of Paul, who, though born in Samosata, was a bishop at Antioch in Syria, wickedly 
taught that the Lord Christ was nothing else than a mere man in whom God the 
Word dwelt, just as in every prophet; therefore he also held that the divine and 
human natures are apart from one another and separate, and that in Christ they 
have no communion whatever with one another, just as though Christ were one, 
and God the Word, who dwells in Him, the other.
17] Against this condemned heresy the Christian Church always and at all times 
has simply believed and held that the divine and the human nature in the person of 
Christ are so united that they have a true communion with one another, whereby 
the natures [do not meet and] are not mingled in one essence, but, as Dr. Luther 
writes, in one person. 18] Accordingly, on account of this personal union and 
communion, the ancient teachers of the Church, before and after the Council of 
Chalcedon, frequently employed the word mixtio, mixture, in a good sense and 
with [true] discrimination. For proof of this, many testimonies of the Fathers, if 
necessary, could be adduced, which are to be found frequently also in the writings 
of our divines, and which explain the personal union and communion by the illus-
tration animae et corporis and ferri candentis, that is, of the soul and body, and 
of glowing iron. 19] For the body and soul, as also fire and iron, have communion 
with each other, not per phrasin, or modum loquendi, or verbaliter (by a phrase 
or mode of speaking, or in mere words), that is, so that it is to be a mere form of 
speech and mere words, but vere and realiter (truly and really), that is, in deed and 
truth; and, nevertheless, no confusio or exaequatio naturarum, that is, a mixing or 
equalizing of the natures, is thereby introduced, as when hydromel is made from 
honey and water, which is no longer pure water or pure honey, but a mixed drink. 
Now, in the union of the divine and the human nature in the person of Christ it 
is far different. For it is a far different, more sublime, and [altogether] ineffable 
communion and union between the divine and the human nature in the person of 
Christ, on account of which union and communion God is man and man is God, 
yet neither the natures nor their properties are thereby intermingled, but each 
nature retains its essence and properties.
20] On account of this personal union, which cannot be thought of nor exist 
without such a true communion of the natures, not the mere human nature, whose 
property it is to suffer and die, has suffered for the sins of the world, but the Son of 
God Himself truly suffered, however, according to the assumed human nature, and 
(in accordance with our simple Christian faith) [as our Apostles’ Creed testifies] 
The Lutheran Confessions
566
truly died, although the divine nature can neither suffer nor die. This Dr. Luther 
has fully explained in his Large Confession concerning the Holy Supper in opposi-
tion to the blasphemous alloeosis of Zwingli, who taught that one nature should be 
taken and understood for the other, which Dr. Luther committed, as a devil’s mask, 
to the abyss of hell.
22] For this reason, then, the ancient teachers of the Church combined both words, 
koinwniva and e{nwsi”, communio et unio, that is, communion and union, in the 
explanation of this mystery, and have explained the one by the other. Irenaeus, lib. 
4, chap. 37; Athanasius, in the Letter to Epictetus; Hilary, Concerning the Trinity, 
Book 9; Basil and Gregory of Nyssa, in Theodoret; Damascenus, Book 3, chap. 19.
23] On account of this personal union and communion of the divine and the 
human nature in Christ we believe, teach, and confess also, according to our simple 
Christian faith, what is said concerning the majesty of Christ according to His 
humanity, [by which He sits] at the right hand of the almighty power of God, and 
what is connected therewith [follows therefrom]; all of which would be naught and 
could not stand if this personal union and communion of the natures in the person 
of Christ did not exist realiter, that is, in deed and truth.
24] On account of this personal union and communion of the natures, Mary, the 
most blessed Virgin, bore not a mere man, but, as the angel [Gabriel] testifies, such 
a man as is truly the Son of the most high God, who showed His divine majesty 
even in His mother’s womb, inasmuch as He was born of a virgin, with her virgini-
ty inviolate. Therefore she is truly the mother of God, and nevertheless remained a 
virgin.
25] In virtue of this He also wrought all His miracles, and manifested this His 
divine majesty, according to His pleasure, when and as He willed, and therefore not 
first after His resurrection and ascension only, but also in His state of humiliation; 
for example, at the wedding at Cana of Galilee; also, when He was twelve years old, 
among the learned; also in the garden, when with a word He cast His enemies to 
the ground; likewise in death, when He died not simply as any other man, but in 
and with His death conquered sin, death, devil, hell, and eternal damnation; which 
the human nature alone would not have been able to do if it had not been thus 
personally united and had not had communion with the divine nature.
26] Hence also the human nature, after the resurrection from the dead, has its 
exaltation above all creatures in heaven and on earth; which is nothing else than 
that He entirely laid aside the form of a servant, and yet did not lay aside His 
human nature, but retains it to eternity, and is put in the full possession and use of 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
567
the divine majesty according to His assumed human nature. However, this majesty 
He had immediately at His conception, even in His mother’s womb, but, as the 
apostle testifies [ Phil. 2:7 ], laid it aside; and, as Dr. Luther explains, He kept it 
concealed in the state of His humiliation, and did not employ it always, but only 
when He wished.
27] But now He does, since He has ascended, not merely as any other saint, to 
heaven, but, as the apostle testifies [ Eph. 4:10 ], above all heavens, and also truly 
fills all things, and being everywhere present, not only as God, but also as man [has 
dominion and] rules from sea to sea and to the ends of the earth; as the prophets 
predict, Ps. 8:1,6; 93:1f ; Zech. 9:10, and the apostles testify, Mark 16:20, that He 
everywhere wrought with them and confirmed their word with signs following. 
28] Yet this occurred not in an earthly way, but, as Dr. Luther explains, according 
to the manner of the right hand of God, which is no fixed place in heaven, as the 
Sacramentarians assert without any ground in the Holy Scriptures, but nothing 
else than the almighty power of God, which fills heaven and earth, in [possession 
of] which Christ is installed according to His humanity, realiter, that is, in deed 
and truth, sine confusione et exaequatione naturarum, that is, without confusion 
and equalizing of the two natures in their essence and essential properties; 29] 
by this communicated [divine] power, according to the words of His testament, 
He can be and truly is present with His body and blood in the Holy Supper, to 
which He has directed us by His Word; this is possible to no other man, because 
no man is in such a way united with the divine nature, and installed in such divine 
almighty majesty and power through and in the personal union of the two natures 
in Christ, as Jesus, the Son of Mary. 30] For in Him the divine and the human 
nature are personally united with one another, so that in Christ dwelleth all the 
fulness of the Godhead bodily, Col. 2:9, and in this personal union have such a sub-
lime, intimate, ineffable communion that even the angels are astonished at it, and, 
as St. Peter testifies, have their delight and joy in looking into it [ 1 Pet. 1:12 ]; all of 
which will shortly be explained in order and somewhat more fully.
31] From this basis of the personal union, as it has been stated and explained 
above, that is, from the manner in which the divine and the human nature in the 
person of Christ are united with one another, namely, that they have not only the 
names in common, but have also in deed and truth communion with one another, 
without any commingling or equalizing of the same in their essences, flows also the 
doctrine de communicatione idiomatum, that is, concerning the true communion 
of the properties of the natures, of which more is to be said hereafter.
32] For since this is verily so, quod propria non egrediantur sua subiecta (that 
properties do not leave their subjects), that is, that each nature retains its essential 
The Lutheran Confessions
568
properties, and these are not separated from the nature and poured into the other 
nature, as water from one vessel into another, so also no communion of properties 
could be or subsist if the above-mentioned personal union or communion of the 
natures in the person of Christ were not true. 33] Next to the article of the Holy 
Trinity this is the greatest mystery in heaven and on earth, as Paul says: Without 
controversy, great is the mystery of godliness, that God was manifest in the flesh, 
1 Tim. 3:16. 34] For since the Apostle Peter in clear words testifies [ 2 Pet. 1:4 ] that 
we also, in whom Christ dwells only by grace, on account of that sublime mystery, 
are in Christ, partakers of the divine nature, what kind of communion of the 
divine nature, then, must that be of which the apostle says that in Christ dwelt all 
the fulness of the Godhead bodily, so that God and man are one person? 35] But 
since it is highly important that this doctrine de communicatione idiomatum, that 
is, of the communion of the properties of both natures, be treated and explained 
with proper discrimination,-for the propositiones or praedicationes, that is, how to 
speak of the person of Christ, and of its natures and properties, are not all of one 
kind and mode, and when they are employed without proper discrimination, the 
doctrine becomes confused and the simple reader is easily led astray,-the following 
explanation should be carefully noted, which, for the purpose of making it plainer 
and simple, may well be comprised under three heads:
36] Namely, first, since in Christ two distinct natures exist and remain unchanged 
and unconfused in their natural essence and properties, and yet of both natures 
there is only one person, hence, that which is, indeed, an attribute of only one 
nature is ascribed not to that nature alone, as separate, but to the entire person, 
which is at the same time God and man (whether it is called God or man).
37] But in hoc genere, that is, in this mode of speaking, it does not follow that 
what is ascribed to the person is at the same time a property of both natures, but it 
is distinctively explained what nature it is according to which anything is ascribed 
to the person. Thus the Son of God was born of the seed of David according to 
the flesh, Rom. 1:3. Also: Christ was put to death according to the flesh, and hath 
suffered for us in, or according to, the flesh, 1 Pet. 3:18;4:1.
38] However, since beneath the words, when it is said that what is peculiar to one 
nature is ascribed to the entire person, secret and open Sacramentarians conceal 
their pernicious error, by naming indeed the entire person, but understanding 
thereby nevertheless only the one nature, and entirely excluding the other nature, 
as though the mere human nature had suffered for us, as Dr. Luther in his Large 
Confession concerning the Holy Supper has written concerning the alloeosis of 
Zwingli, we will here set down Luther’s own words, in order that the Church of 
God may be guarded in the best way against this error. His words are as follows:
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
569
39] Zwingli calls that an alloeosis when something is said of the divinity of Christ 
which really belongs to the humanity, or vice versa. As Luke 24:26: “Ought not 
Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into His glory?” Here Zwingli 
juggles, asserting that [the word] Christ is understood of the human nature. 40]
Beware, beware, I say, of the alloeosis! For it is a devil’s mask, for at last it manufac-
tures such a Christ after whom I certainly would not be a Christian; namely, that 
henceforth Christ should be no more and do no more with His sufferings and life 
than any other mere saint. For if I believe this [permit myself to be persuaded] that 
only the human nature has suffered for me, then Christ is to me a poor Savior, then 
He Himself indeed needs a Savior. In a word, it is unspeakable what the devil seeks 
by the alloeosis.
41] And shortly afterwards: If the old weather-witch, Dame Reason, the 
grandmother of the alloeosis, would say, Yea, divinity cannot suffer nor die; you 
shall reply, That is true; yet, because in Christ divinity and humanity are one 
person, Scripture, on account of this personal union, ascribes also to divinity 
everything that happens to the humanity, and vice versa. 42] And it is so in reality; 
for you must certainly answer this, that the person (meaning Christ) suffers and 
dies. Now the person is true God; therefore it is rightly said: The Son of God 
suffers. For although the one part (to speak thus), namely, the divinity, does not 
suffer, yet the person, which is God, suffers in the other part, namely, in His 
humanity; for in truth God’s Son has been crucified for us, that is, the person 
which is God. For the person, the person, I say, was crucified according to the 
humanity.
43] And again, shortly afterwards: If the alloeosis is to stand as Zwingli teaches 
it, then Christ will have to be two persons, one divine and one human, because 
Zwingli applies the passages concerning suffering to the human nature alone, and 
diverts them entirely from the divinity. For if the works be parted and separated, 
the person must also be divided, since all the works or sufferings are ascribed 
not to the natures, but to the person. For it is the person that does and suffers 
everything, one thing according to one nature, and another according to the other 
nature, all of which the learned know well. Therefore we regard our Lord Christ as 
God and man in one person, non confundendo naturas nec dividendo personam, so 
that we neither confound the natures nor divide the person.
44] Dr. Luther says also in his book Of the Councils and the Church: We 
Christians must know that if God is not also in the balance, and gives the weight, 
we sink to the bottom with our scale. By this I mean: If it were not to be said [if 
these things were not true], God has died for us, but only a man, we would be lost. 
But if “God’s death” and “God died” lie in the scale of the balance, then He sinks 
The Lutheran Confessions
570
down, and we rise up as a light, empty scale. But indeed He can also rise again 
or leap out of the scale; yet He could not sit in the scale unless He became a man 
like us, so that it could be said: “God died,” “God’s passion,” “God’s blood,” “God’s 
death.” For in His nature God cannot die; but now that God and man are united in 
one person, it is correctly called God’s death, when the man dies who is one thing 
or one person with God. Thus far Luther.
45] Hence it is manifest that it is incorrect to say or write that the above-
mentioned expressions (God suffered, God died) are only praedicationes verbales 
(verbal assertions), that is, mere words, and that it is not so in fact. For our simple 
Christian faith proves that the Son of God, who became man, suffered for us, died 
for us and redeemed us with His blood.
46] Secondly, as to the execution of the office of Christ, the person does not act 
and work in, with, through, or according to only one nature, but in, according 
to, with, and through both natures, or, as the Council of Chalcedon expresses it, 
one nature operates in communion with the other what is a property of each. 47]
Therefore Christ is our Mediator, Redeemer, King, High Priest, Head, Shepherd, 
etc., not according to one nature only, whether it be the divine or the human, but 
according to both natures, as this doctrine has been treated more fully in other 
places.
48] Thirdly, however, it is still a much different thing when the question, 
declaration, or discussion is, whether the natures in the personal union in Christ 
have nothing else or nothing more than only their natural, essential properties; for 
that they have and retain these has been mentioned above.
49] Now, as regards the divine nature in Christ, since in God there is no change, 
Jas. 1:17, His divine nature, in its essence and properties, suffered no subtraction 
nor addition by the incarnation; was not, in or by itself, either diminished or 
increased thereby.
50] But as regards the assumed human nature in the person of Christ, some have 
indeed wished to contend that even in the personal union with divinity it has 
nothing else and nothing more than only its natural, essential properties according 
to which it is in all things like its brethren; and that, on this account, nothing 
should or could be ascribed to the human nature in Christ which is beyond, or 
contrary to, its natural properties, even though the testimony of Scripture is to 
that effect. 51] But that this opinion is false and incorrect is so clear from God’s 
Word that even their own associates rebuke and reject this error. For the Holy 
Scriptures, and the ancient Fathers from the Scriptures [in which they were fully 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
571
trained], testify forcefully that, for the reason and because of the fact that it has 
been personally united with the divine nature in Christ, the human nature in 
Christ, when it was glorified and exalted to the right hand of the majesty and 
power of God, after the form of a servant and humiliation had been laid aside, did 
receive, apart from, and over and above its natural, essential, permanent proper-
ties, also special, high, great, supernatural, inscrutable, ineffable, heavenly pre-
rogativas (prerogatives) and excellences in majesty, glory, power, and might above 
everything that can be named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to 
come [Eph. 1:21]; and that, accordingly, in the operations of the office of Christ: 
the human nature in Christ, in its measure and mode, is equally employed [at the 
same time], and has also its efficaciam, that is, power and, efficacy, not only from, 
and according to, its natural, essential attributes, or only so far as their ability 
extends, but chiefly from, and according to, the majesty, glory, power, and might 
which it has received through the personal union, glorification, and exaltation. 52] 
And nowadays even the adversaries can or dare scarcely deny this, except that they 
dispute and contend that those are only created gifts or finitae qualitates (finite 
qualities), as in the saints, with which the human nature in Christ is endowed and 
adorned; and that, according to their [crafty] thoughts or from their own [silly] 
argumentationes (argumentations) or [fictitious] proofs, they wish to measure 
and calculate of what the human nature in Christ could or should be capable or 
incapable without becoming annihilated.
53] But the best, most certain, and surest way in this controversy is this, namely, 
that what Christ has received according to His assumed human nature through 
the personal union, glorification, or exaltation, and of what His assumed human 
nature is capable beyond the natural properties, without becoming annihilated, 
no one can know better or more thoroughly than the Lord Christ Himself; and He 
has revealed it in His Word, as much as is needful for us to know of it in this life. 
Now, everything for which we have in this instance clear, certain testimonies in the 
Scriptures, we must simply believe, and in no way argue against it, as though the 
human nature in Christ could not be capable of the same.
54] Now it is indeed correct and true what has been said concerning the created 
gifts which have been given and imparted to the human nature in Christ, that it 
possesses them in or of itself. But these do not reach unto the majesty which the 
Scriptures, and the ancient Fathers from Scripture, ascribe to the assumed human 
nature in Christ.
55] For to quicken, to have all judgment and all power in heaven and on earth, to 
have all things in His hands, to have all things in subjection beneath His feet, to 
The Lutheran Confessions
572
cleanse from sin, etc., are not created gifts, but divine, infinite properties; and yet, 
according to the declaration of Scripture, these have been given and communicated 
to the man Christ, John 5:27; 6:39; Matt. 28:18; Dan. 7:14; John 3:35; 13:3; Matt. 11:27; 
Eph. 1:22; Heb. 2:8; 1 Cor. 15:27; John 1:3.
56] And that this communication is not to be understood per phrasin aut modum 
loquendi (as a phrase or mode of speaking), that is, only in words, with respect 
to the person according to the divine nature alone, but according to the assumed 
human nature, the three strong, irrefutable arguments and reasons, now following, 
show:
57] 1. First, there is a unanimously received rule of the entire ancient orthodox 
Church that what Holy Scripture testifies that Christ received in time He received 
not according to the divine nature (according to which He has everything from 
eternity), but the person has received it in time ratione et respectu humanae 
naturae, that is, as referring, and with respect to, according to the assumed human 
nature.
58] 2. Secondly, the Scriptures testify clearly, John 5:21f; 6:39f, that the power to 
quicken and to execute judgment has been given to Christ for the reason that He is 
the Son of Man, and in as far as He has flesh and blood.
59] 3. Thirdly, the Scriptures speak not merely in general of the Son of Man, but 
also indicate expressly His assumed human nature, 1 John 1:7: The blood of Jesus 
Christ, His Son, cleanseth us from all sin, not only according to the merit [of 
the blood of Christ] which was once attained on the cross; but in this place John 
speaks of this, that in the work or act of justification not only the divine nature 
in Christ, but also His blood per modum efficaciae (by mode of efficacy), that 
is, actually, cleanses us from all sins. Thus in John 6:48-58 the flesh of Christ is a 
quickening food; as also the Council of Ephesus concluded from this [statement 
of the evangelist and apostle] that the flesh of Christ has power to quicken; and as 
many other glorious testimonies of the ancient orthodox Church concerning this 
article are cited elsewhere.
60] Now, that Christ, according to His human nature, has received this, and that 
it has been given and communicated to the assumed human nature in Christ, we 
shall and must believe according to the Scriptures. But, as above said, since the 
two natures in Christ are united in such a manner that they are not mingled with 
one another or changed one into the other, and each retains its natural, essential 
property, so that the properties of one nature never become properties of the other 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
573
nature, this doctrine must also be rightly explained and diligently guarded against 
all heresies.
61] While we, then, invent nothing new of ourselves, but receive and repeat the 
explanations which the ancient orthodox Church has given hereof from the good 
foundation of Holy Scripture, namely, that this divine power, life, might, majesty, 
and glory was given to the assumed human nature in Christ, not in such a way as 
the Father from eternity has communicated to the Son, according to the divine 
nature, His essence and all divine attributes, whence He is of one essence with 
the Father and is equal to God (for Christ is equal to the Father only according 
to the divine nature, while according to the assumed human nature He is beneath 
God; from which it is manifest that we make no confusionem, exaequationem, 
abolitionem, that is, no confusion, equalization, or abolition of natures in Christ), 
so, too, the power to quicken is in the flesh of Christ not in that manner in which 
it is in His divine nature, namely, as an essential property.
62] Moreover, this communication or impartation has not occurred through an 
essential or natural infusion of the properties of the divine nature into the human, 
so that the humanity of Christ would have these by itself and apart from the divine 
essence, or as though the human nature in Christ had thereby [by this commu-
nication] entirely laid aside its natural, essential properties and were now either 
transformed into divinity, or had, with such communicated properties, in and by 
itself become equal to the same, or that there should now be for both natures iden-
tical or, at any rate, equal natural, essential properties and operations. For these 
and similar erroneous doctrines were justly rejected and condemned in the ancient 
approved councils on the basis of Holy Scripture. Nullo enim modo vel facienda 
vel admittenda est aut conversio aut confusio aut exaequatio sive naturarum in 
Christo sive essentialium proprietatum. That is: For in no way is conversion, con-
fusion, or equalization of the natures in Christ or of their essential properties to be 
maintained [made] or admitted.
63] Accordingly, we have never understood the words realis communicatio or com-
municated realiter, that is, the impartation or communion which occurs in deed 
and truth, of any physica communicatio vel essentialis transfusio, physical com-
munication or essential transfusion, that is, of an essential, natural communion or 
effusion, by which the natures would be commingled in their essence, and their es-
sential properties, as some have craftily and wickedly, against their own conscience, 
perverted these words and phrases in order to make the pure doctrine suspected; 
but we have only opposed them to verbalis communicatio (verbal communication), 
that is, to this doctrine, when such persons assert that it is only phrasis and modus 
loquendi (a phrase and mode of speaking), that is, nothing more than mere words, 
The Lutheran Confessions
574
titles, and names, upon which they have also laid so much stress that they would 
know of no other communion. Hence, for the true explanation of the majesty of 
Christ we have used such terms de reali communicatione (of real communion), and 
wished to indicate by them that this communion has occurred in deed and truth, 
however, without any confusion of natures and their essential properties.
64] We, therefore, hold and teach, in conformity with the ancient orthodox 
Church, as it has explained this doctrine from the Scriptures, that the human 
nature in Christ has received this majesty according to the manner of the personal 
union, namely, because the entire fulness of the divinity dwells in Christ, not as in 
other holy men or angels, but bodily, as in its own body, so that it shines forth with 
all its majesty, power, glory, and efficacy in the assumed human nature, voluntarily 
when and as He [Christ] wills, and in, with, and through the same manifests, 
exercises, and executes His divine power, glory, and efficacy, as the soul does in 
the body and fire in glowing iron (for by means of these illustrations, as was also 
mentioned above, the entire ancient Church has explained this doctrine). 65] This 
was concealed and withheld [for the greater part] at the time of the humiliation; 
but now, after the form of a servant [or exinanition] has been laid aside, it is fully, 
powerfully, and publicly exercised before all saints, in heaven and on earth; and in 
the life to come we shall also behold this His glory face to face, John 17:24.
66] Thus there is and remains in Christ only one divine omnipotence, power, 
majesty, and glory, which is peculiar to the divine nature alone; but it shines, 
manifests, and exercises itself fully, yet voluntarily, in, with, and through the 
assumed, exalted human nature in Christ. Just as in glowing iron there are not two 
kinds of power to shine and burn [as though the fire had a peculiar, and the iron 
also a peculiar and separate power of shining and burning], but the power to shine 
and to burn is a property of the fire; but since the fire is united with the iron, it 
manifests and exercises this its power to shine and to burn in, with, and through 
the glowing iron, so that thence and from this union also the glowing iron has the 
power to shine and to burn without conversion of the essence and of the natural 
properties of fire and iron.
67] For this reason we understand such testimonies of Scripture as speak of the 
majesty to which the human nature in Christ is exalted, not in such a way as if the 
divine majesty, which is peculiar to the divine nature of the Son of God, is in the 
person of the Son of Man to be ascribed [to Christ] simply and purely according 
to His divine nature, or that this majesty is to be in the human nature of Christ in 
such a manner only that from it His human nature should have but the mere title 
and name per phrasin et modum loquendi (by a phrase and mode of speaking), that 
is, only in words, but in deed and truth should have no communion whatever with 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
575
it. 68] For in that way (since God is a spiritual, undivided essence, and therefore 
present everywhere and in all creatures, and wherever He is, dwelling, however, 
especially in believers and saints, there He has with Him such majesty of His) it 
might also be said with truth that in all creatures in whom God is, but especially 
in believers and saints, in whom He dwells, all the fulness of the Godhead dwells 
bodily, all treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hid, all power in heaven and 
earth is given, because the Holy Ghost, who has all power, is given them. 69] In 
this way, then, no distinction would be made between Christ according to His 
human nature and other holy men, and thus Christ would be deprived of His 
majesty, which He has received above all creatures, as a man or according to His 
human nature. 70] For no other creature, neither man nor angel, can or shall say: 
All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth, since, although God, with 
all the fulness of His Godhead, which He has everywhere with Himself, is in the 
saints, He does not dwell in them bodily, nor is personally united with them as in 
Christ. For from such personal union it follows that Christ says, even according to 
His human nature, Matt. 28:18: All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. 
Also John 13:3: Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands. 
Also Col. 2:9: In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. Also: Thou 
crownedst Him with glory and honor, and didst set Him over the works of Thy 
hands; Thou hast put all things in subjection under His feet. For in that He put all 
in subjection under Him, He left nothing that is not put under Him, Heb. 2:7f ; Ps. 
8:6. He is excepted which did put all things under Him, 1 Cor. 15:27.
71] By no means, however, do we believe, teach, and confess such an infusion of the 
majesty of God and of all its properties into the human nature of Christ by which 
the divine nature is weakened [by which anything of the divine nature departs], 
or anything of its own is surrendered to another that it does not retain for itself, 
or that the human nature in its substance and essence should have received equal 
majesty, separate or distinct from the nature and essence of the Son of God, as 
when water, wine, or oil is poured from one vessel into another. For the human 
nature, as also no other creature, either in heaven or on earth, is capable of the 
omnipotence of God in such a manner that it would become in itself an almighty 
essence, or have in and by itself almighty properties; for thereby the human nature 
in Christ would be denied, and would be entirely converted into the divinity, 
which is contrary to our Christian faith, as also to the doctrine of all the prophets 
and apostles.
72] But we believe, teach, and confess that God the Father has so given His Spirit 
to Christ, His beloved Son, according to the assumed humanity (on account of 
which He is called also Messias, i.e., the Anointed), that He has not received 
His gifts by measure as other saints. For upon Christ the Lord, according to His 
The Lutheran Confessions
576
assumed human nature (because, according to His divinity, He is of one essence 
with the Holy Ghost), rests the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of 
counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge [and of the fear of the Lord, Col. 2:3; 
Is. 11:2; 61:1 ], 73] not in such a way that on this account, as a man, He knew and 
could do only some things, as other saints know and can do by the Spirit of God, 
who works in them only created gifts, but since Christ, according to His divinity, 
is the second person in the Holy Trinity, and from Him, as also from the Father, 
the Holy Ghost proceeds, and thus is and remains His and the Father’s own Spirit 
to all eternity, not separated from the Son of God, therefore (as the Fathers say) 
the entire fulness of the Spirit has been communicated by the personal union to 
Christ according to the flesh, which is personally united with the Son of God. 74] 
This voluntarily manifests and shows itself, with all its power therein, therewith 
and thereby [in, with, and through the human nature of Christ], so that He [Christ, 
according to His human nature] not only knows some things and is ignorant 
of others, can do some things and is unable to do others, but [according to the 
assumed human nature] knows and can do all things. For upon Him the Father 
poured without measure the Spirit of wisdom and power, so that, as man, He has 
received through this personal union all knowledge and all power in deed and 
truth. And thus all the treasures of wisdom are hidden in Him, thus all power is 
given to Him, and He is seated at the right hand of the majesty and power of God. 
75] From history it can be learned that at the time of the Emperor Valens there 
was among the Arians a peculiar sect which was called the Agnoetae, because they 
imagined that the Son, the Word of the Father, knew indeed all things, but that 
His assumed human nature is ignorant of many things; against whom also Gregory 
the Great wrote.
76] On account of this personal union, and the communion resulting from it, 
which the divine and the human nature have with one another in the person of 
Christ in deed and truth, there is ascribed to Christ according to the flesh what 
His flesh, according to its nature and essence, cannot be of itself, and, apart from 
this union, cannot have, namely, that His flesh is a truly quickening food and His 
blood a truly quickening drink; as the two hundred Fathers of the Council of 
Ephesus have testified, carnem Christi esse vivificam seu vivificatricem, that is, 
that the flesh of Christ is a quickening flesh [or a quickener]. Hence, too, this man 
only, and no man besides, either in heaven or on earth, can say with truth, Matt. 
18:20: Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the 
midst of them. Also Matt. 28:20: Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the 
world.
77] And these testimonies we do not understand, as though only the divinity of 
Christ were present with us in the Christian Church and congregation, and such 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
577
presence were to concern Christ according to His humanity in no way whatever; 
for in that manner Peter, Paul, and all the saints in heaven, since divinity which is 
everywhere present dwells in them, would also be with us on earth, which the Holy 
Scriptures, however, testify only of Christ, and of no other man besides. 78] But 
we hold that by these words [the above passages of Scripture] the majesty of the 
man Christ is declared, which Christ has received, according to His humanity, at 
the right hand of the majesty and power of God, namely, that also according to His 
assumed human nature and with the same, He can be, and also is, present where 
He will, and especially that in His Church and congregation on earth He is present 
as Mediator, Head, King, and High Priest, not in part, or one-half of Him only, but 
the entire person of Christ is present, to which both natures belong, the divine and 
the human; not only according to His divinity, but also according to, and with, His 
assumed human nature, according to which He is our 79] Brother, and we are flesh 
of His flesh and bone of His bone. Even as He has instituted His Holy Supper for 
the certain assurance and confirmation of this, that also according to that nature 
according to which He has flesh and blood He will be with us, and dwell, work, 
and be efficacious in us.
80] Upon this firm foundation Dr. Luther, of blessed memory, has also written 
[faithfully and clearly] concerning the majesty of Christ according to His human 
nature.
81] In the Large Confession concerning the Lord’s Supper he writes thus concern-
ing the person of Christ: Now, since He [Christ] is such a man as is supernaturally 
one person with God, and apart from this man there is no God, it must follow 
that also according to the third, supernatural mode He is and can be in every place 
where God is, and all things are through and through full of Christ, also according 
to the humanity, not according to the first corporeal, comprehensible mode, but 
according to the supernatural, divine mode. Vol. 2, Wittenb. Germ., fol. 191.
82] For here you must stand [confess] and say: Wherever Christ according to the 
divinity is, there He is a natural, divine person, and He is there also naturally and 
personally, as His conception in His mother’s womb well shows. For if He were to 
be God’s son, He must, naturally and personally be in His mother’s womb and be-
come man. Now, if He is naturally and personally wherever He is, He must also be 
man in the same place. For there are not [in Christ] two separate persons, but only 
one person: wherever it is, there it is the one undivided person; and wherever you 
can say, Here is God, there you must also say, Then Christ the man is also there. 
And if you would point out a place where God is, and not the man, the person 
would already be divided, because I could then say with truth: Here is God who is 
not man, and who never as yet has become man.

83] However, no such a God for me! For it would follow hence that space and place 
separated the two natures from one another, and divided the person, and yet even 
death and all devils could not divide or rend them from one another. 84] And there 
would remain to me a poor sort of Christ [a Christ of how much value, pray?], who 
would be a divine and human person at the same time in no more than in only one 
place, while in all other places He must be only a mere separate God and divine 
person without humanity. No, friend, wherever you place God, there you must also 
place with Him humanity; they do not allow themselves to be separated or divided 
from one another. There has been made [in Christ] one person, and it [the Son of 
God] does not separate from itself the [assumed] humanity.
85] In the little book concerning the Last Words of David, which Dr. Luther wrote 
shortly before his death, he says as follows: According to the other, the temporal, 
human birth, also the eternal power of God has been given Him; however, in time, 
and not from eternity. For the humanity of Christ has not been from eternity, like 
the divinity; but, as we reckon and write, Jesus, the Son of Mary, is 1543 years old 
this year. But from the instant when divinity and humanity were united in one 
person, the man, the Son of Mary, is and is called almighty, eternal God, who has 
eternal might, and has created and sustains all things per communicationem idio-
matum for the reason that He is one person with the divinity, and is also true God. 
Of this He speaks Matt. 11:27: “All things are delivered unto Me of My Father”; and 
Matt. 28:18: “All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.” To which Me? 
To Me, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Mary, and born man. From eternity I have it 
of the Father, before I became man. But when I became man, I received it in time, 
according to humanity, and kept it concealed until My resurrection and ascen-
sion; when it was to be manifested and declared, as St. Paul says, Rom. 1:4: “He is 
declared and proved to be a Son of God with power.” John 17:10 calls it “glorified.” 
Vol. 5, Wittenb. Germ., fol. 545.
86] Similar testimonies are found in Dr. Luther’s writings, but especially in the 
book That These Words Still Stand Firm, and in the Large Confession concerning 
the Holy Supper; to which writings, as well-grounded explanations of the majesty 
of Christ at the right hand of God, and of His testament, we would be understood 
as having referred, for the sake of brevity, in this article, as well as in the Holy 
Supper, as has been heretofore mentioned.
87] Therefore we regard it as a pernicious error when such majesty is denied 
to Christ according to His humanity. For thereby the very great consolation is 
taken from Christians which they have in the aforecited promise concerning the 
presence and dwelling with them of their Head, King, and High Priest, who has 
promised them that not only His mere divinity would be with them, which to us 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
579
poor sinners is as a consuming fire to dry stubble, but that He, He, the man who 
has spoken with them, who has tried all tribulations in His assumed human nature, 
and who can therefore have sympathy with us, as with men and His brethren,-He 
will be with us in all our troubles also according to the nature according to which 
He is our brother and we are flesh of His flesh.
88] Therefore we unanimously reject and condemn, with mouth and heart, all 
errors not in accordance with the doctrine presented, as contrary to the prophetic 
and apostolic Scriptures, the pure [received and approved] symbols, and our 
Christian Augsburg Confession
89] 1. As, when it is believed or taught by any one that on account of the personal 
union the human nature is mingled with the divine or is changed into it.
90] 2. Also, that the human nature in Christ is everywhere present in the same 
mode as the divinity, as an infinite essence, by essential power and property of its 
nature.
91] 3. Also, that the human nature in Christ has become equal to and like the 
divine nature in its substance and essence or in its essential properties.
92] 4. Also, that the humanity of Christ is locally extended in all places of heaven 
and earth; which is to be ascribed not even to the divinity. But that Christ, by His 
divine omnipotence can be present with His body, which He has placed at the 
right hand of the majesty and power of God, wherever He will, especially where 
He has, in His Word, promised this His presence, as in the Holy Supper, this His 
omnipotence and wisdom can well accomplish without change or abolition of His 
true human nature.
93] 5. Also, that the mere human nature of Christ has suffered for us and redeemed 
us, with which the Son of God is said to have had no communion whatever in 
suffering.
94] 6. Also, that Christ is present with us on earth in the Word preached and in 
the right use of the holy Sacraments only according to His divinity, and that this 
presence of Christ does not in any way pertain to His assumed human nature.
95] 7. Also, that the assumed human nature in Christ has in deed and truth no 
communion whatever with the divine power, might, wisdom, majesty, and glory, 
but has in common only the mere title and name.
The Lutheran Confessions
580
96] These errors, and all that are contrary and opposed to the [godly and pure] 
doctrine presented above, we reject and condemn as contrary to the pure Word of 
God, the Scriptures of the holy prophets and apostles, and our Christian faith and 
confession. And we admonish all Christians, since in the Holy Scriptures Christ 
is called a mystery upon which all heretics dash their heads, not to indulge in a 
presumptuous manner in subtile inquiries, concerning such mysteries, with their 
reason, but with the venerated apostles simply to believe, to close the eyes of their 
reason, and bring into captivity their understanding to the obedience of Christ, 
2 Cor. 10:5, and to take comfort [seek most delightful and sure consolation], and 
hence to rejoice without ceasing in the fact that our flesh and blood is placed so 
high at the right hand of the majesty and almighty power of God. Thus we shall 
assuredly find constant consolation in every adversity, and remain well guarded 
from pernicious error.
IX. Christ’s Descent to Hell
1] And since even in the ancient Christian teachers of the Church, as well as in 
some among our teachers, dissimilar explanations of the article concerning the 
descent of Christ to hell are found, we abide in like manner by the simplicity of 
our Christian faith [comprised in the Creed], to which Dr. Luther in his sermon, 
which was delivered in the castle at Torgau in the year 1533, concerning the descent 
of Christ to hell, has pointed us, where we confess: I believe in the Lord Christ, 
God’s Son, our Lord, dead, buried, and descended into hell. For in this [Confes-
sion] the burial and descent of Christ to hell are distinguished as different articles; 
2] and we simply believe that the entire person, God and man, after the burial 
descended into hell, conquered the devil, destroyed the power of hell, and took 
from the devil all his might. 3] We should not, however, trouble ourselves with 
high and acute thoughts as to how this occurred; for with our reason and our five 
senses this article can be comprehended as little as the preceding one, how Christ 
is placed at the right hand of the almighty power and majesty of God; but we are 
simply to believe it and adhere to the Word [in such mysteries of faith]. Thus we 
retain the substance [sound doctrine] and [true] consolation that neither hell nor 
the devil can take captive or injure us and all who believe in Christ.
X. Church Rites, Commonly Called Adiaphora.
1] Concerning ceremonies and church rites which are neither commanded 
nor forbidden in God’s Word, but are introduced into the Church with a good 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
581
intention, for the sake of good order and propriety, or otherwise to maintain 
Christian discipline, a dissension has likewise arisen among some theologians of 
the Augsburg Confession: 2] the one side holding that also in time of persecution 
and in case of confession [when confession of faith is to be made], even though the 
enemies of the Gospel do not come to an agreement with us in doctrine, yet some 
ceremonies, abrogated [long since], which in themselves are adiaphora, and neither 
commanded nor forbidden by God, may, without violence to conscience, be 
reestablished in compliance with the pressure and demand of the adversaries, and 
thus in such [things which are of themselves] adiaphora, or matters of indifference, 
we may indeed come to an agreement [have conformity] with them. 3] But the 
other side contended that in time of persecution, in case of confession, especially 
when it is the design of the adversaries, either through force and compulsion, or 
in an insidious manner, to suppress the pure doctrine, and gradually to introduce 
again into our churches their false doctrine, this, also in adiaphora, can in no way 
be done, as has been said, without violence to conscience and prejudice to the 
divine truth.
4] To explain this controversy, and by God’s grace finally to settle it, we present 
to the Christian reader this simple statement regarding the matter [in conformity 
with the Word of God]:
5] Namely, when under the title and pretext of external adiaphora such things are 
proposed as are in principle contrary to God’s Word (although painted another 
color), these are not to be regarded as adiaphora, in which one is free to act as he 
will, but must be avoided as things prohibited by God. In like manner, too, such 
ceremonies should not be reckoned among the genuine free adiaphora, or matters 
of indifference, as make a show or feign the appearance, as though our religion 
and that of the Papists were not far apart, thus to avoid persecution, or as though 
the latter were not at least highly offensive to us; or when such ceremonies are 
designed for the purpose, and required and received in this sense, as though by and 
through them both contrary religions were reconciled and became one body; or 
when a reentering into the Papacy and a departure from the pure doctrine of the 
Gospel and true religion should occur or gradually follow therefrom [when there 
is danger lest we seem to have reentered the Papacy, and to have departed, or to be 
on the point of departing gradually, from the pure doctrine of the Gospel].
6] For in this case what Paul writes, 2 Cor. 6:14-17, shall and must obtain: Be ye 
not unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what communion hath light 
with darkness?Wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the 
Lord.
The Lutheran Confessions
582
7] Likewise, when there are useless, foolish displays, that are profitable neither for 
good order nor Christian discipline, nor evangelical propriety in the Church, these 
also are not genuine adiaphora, or matters of indifference.
8] But as regards genuine adiaphora, or matters of indifference (as explained 
before), we believe, teach, and confess that such ceremonies, in and of themselves, 
are no worship of God, nor any part of it, but must be properly distinguished from 
such as are, as it is written: In vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the 
commandments of men, Matt. 15:9.
9] Therefore we believe, teach, and confess that the congregation of God of every 
place and every time has, according to its circumstances, the good right, power, 
and authority [in matters truly adiaphora] to change, to diminish, and to increase 
them, without thoughtlessness and offense, in an orderly and becoming way, 
as at any time it may be regarded most profitable, most beneficial, and best for 
[preserving] good order, [maintaining] Christian discipline [and for eujtaxiva 
worthy of the profession of the Gospel], and the edification of the Church. 
Moreover, how we can yield and give way with a good conscience to the weak 
in faith in such external adiaphora, Paul teaches Rom. 14, and proves it by his 
example, Acts 16:3; 21:26; 1 Cor. 9:19.
10] We believe, teach, and confess also that at the time of confession [when a 
confession of the heavenly truth is required], when the enemies of God’s Word 
desire to suppress the pure doctrine of the holy Gospel, the entire congregation 
of God, yea, every Christian, but especially the ministers of the Word, as the 
leaders of the congregation of God [as those whom God has appointed to rule 
His Church], are bound by God’s Word to confess freely and openly the [godly] 
doctrine, and what belongs to the whole of [pure] religion, not only in words, but 
also in works and with deeds; and that then, in this case, even in such [things truly 
and of themselves] adiaphora, they must not yield to the adversaries, or permit 
these [adiaphora] to be forced upon them by their enemies, whether by violence 
or cunning, to the detriment of the true worship of God and the introduction and 
sanction of idolatry. 11] For it is written, Gal. 5:1: Stand fast, therefore, in the liber-
ty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not again entangled in the yoke of 
bondage. Also Gal. 2:4f : And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, 
who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they 
might bring us into bondage; to whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an 
hour, that the truth of the Gospel might continue with you. 12] [Now it is manifest 
that in that place Paul speaks concerning circumcision, which at that time had 
become an adiaphoron (1 Cor. 7:18f.), and which at other occasions was observed by 
Paul (however, with Christian and spiritual freedom, Acts 16:3). But when the false 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
583
apostles urged circumcision for establishing their false doctrine, (that the works 
of the Law were necessary for righteousness and salvation,) and misused it for con-
firming their error in the minds of men, Paul says that he would not yield even for 
an hour, in order that the truth of the Gospel might continue unimpaired.]
13] Thus Paul yields and gives way to the weak as to food and [the observance of] 
times or days, Rom. 14:6. But to the false apostles, who wished to impose these 
upon the conscience as necessary things, he will yield not even in such things as in 
themselves are adiaphora, Col. 2:16: Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in 
drink, or in respect of an holy day. And when Peter and Barnabas yielded some-
what [more than they ought] in such an emergency, Paul openly reproves them as 
those who in this matter were not walking aright, according to the truth of the 
Gospel, Gal. 2:11ff
14] For here it is no longer a question concerning external matters of indifference, 
which in their nature and essence are and remain of themselves free, and 
accordingly can admit of no command or prohibition that they be employed or 
omitted; but it is a question, in the first place, concerning the eminent article of 
our Christian faith, as the apostle testifies, that the truth of the Gospel might 
continue, which is obscured and perverted by such compulsion or command, 
because such adiaphora are then either publicly required for the sanction of false 
doctrine, superstition, and idolatry, and for the suppression of pure doctrine and 
Christian liberty, or at least are abused for this purpose by the adversaries, and are 
thus viewed [and are believed to be restored for this abuse and wicked end].
15] Likewise, the article concerning Christian liberty also is here at stake, which 
the Holy Ghost through the mouth of the holy apostle so earnestly charged His 
Church to preserve, as we have just heard. For as soon as this is weakened and the 
ordinances of men [human traditions] are forced upon the Church with coercion, 
as though it were wrong and a sin to omit them, the way is already prepared for 
idolatry, and by this means ordinances of men [human traditions] are afterwards 
multiplied and regarded as a divine worship, not only equal to the ordinances of 
God, but are even placed above them.
16] Moreover, by such [untimely] yielding and conformity in external things, where 
there has not been previously Christian union in doctrine, idolaters are confirmed 
in their idolatry; on the other hand, the true believers are grieved, offended, and 
weakened in their faith [their faith is grievously shaken, and made to totter as 
though by a battering-ram]; both of which every Christian for the sake of his 
soul’s welfare and salvation is bound to avoid, as it is written: Woe unto the world 
because of offenses! Also: Whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe 
The Lutheran Confessions
584
in Me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that 
he were drowned in the depth of the sea [Matt. 18:6, 7].
17] But it is to be especially remembered what Christ says: Whosoever therefore 
shalt confess Me before men, him will I confess also before My Father which is in 
heaven, Matt. 10:32.
18] However, that this has always and everywhere been the faith and confession, 
concerning such indifferent matters, of the chief teachers of the Augsburg 
Confession, into whose footsteps we have entered, and in whose Confession we 
intend by God’s grace to persevere, is shown [most clearly] by the following testi-
monies drawn from the Smalcald Articles, which were composed and subscribed in 
the year 1537:
From the Smalcald Articles, in the Year 1537, etc.
19] The Smalcald Articles (Of the Church) say concerning this as follows: We do 
not concede to them (the papal bishops) that they are the Church, and indeed they 
are not; nor will we listen to those things which, under the name of Church, they 
enjoin and forbid. For, thank God, [today] a child seven years old knows what the 
Church is, namely, the saints, believers, and lambs, who hear the voice of their 
Shepherd. And shortly before (Of Ordination and Vocation): If the bishops would 
be true bishops, and would devote themselves to the Church and the Gospel, it 
might be granted to them, for the sake of love and unity, but not from necessity, 
to ordain and confirm us and our preachers; omitting, however, all comedies and 
spectacular doings of an unchristian nature and display. But, because they neither 
are, nor wish to be, true bishops, but worldly lords and princes, who will neither 
preach, nor teach, nor baptize, nor administer the Lord’s Supper, nor perform any 
work or office of the Church, and, moreover, persecute and condemn those who, 
having been called to do so, discharge these functions, the Church ought not on 
their account to remain without ministers.
20] And in the article Of the Papacy, the Smalcald Articles say (475:14): Therefore, 
just as little as we can worship the devil himself as Lord and God, we can endure 
his apostle, the Pope, or Antichrist, in his rule as head or lord. For to lie and to kill 
and to destroy body and soul eternally, that is wherein his papal government really 
consists.
21] And in the treatise Concerning the Power and Primacy of the Pope, which is 
appended to the Smalcald Articles, and was also subscribed by the theologians 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
585
then present with their own hands, are these words: No one is to burden the 
Church with his own traditions, but here the rule is to be that nobody’s power or 
authority is to avail more than the Word of God.
22] And shortly afterwards (517:41): This being the case, all Christians ought most 
diligently to beware of becoming partakers of the godless doctrine, blasphemies, 
and unjust cruelties of the Pope; but ought to desert and execrate the Pope with his 
members, or adherents, as the kingdom of Antichrist, just as Christ has command-
ed (Matt. 7:15): “Beware of false prophets.” And Paul commands us to avoid false 
teachers and execrate them as an abomination. And in 2 Cor. 6:14 he says: “Be ye 
not unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what communion hath light 
with darkness?”
23] It is a grave matter wanting to separate one’s self from so many lands and 
nations, and to profess a separate doctrine; but here stands God’s command, that 
every one should beware and not agree with those who maintain false doctrine, or 
who think of supporting it by means of cruelty.
24] So Dr. Luther, too, has amply instructed the Church of God in a special treatise 
concerning what should be thought of ceremonies in general, and especially of 
adiaphora, Vol. 3, Jena, p. 523; as was also done in 1530, and can be seen in Tom. 3, 
Jena, German.
25] From this explanation every one can understand what every Christian 
congregation and every Christian man, especially in time of confession [when a 
confession of faith should be made], and, most of all, preachers, are to do or to 
leave undone, without injury to conscience, with respect to adiaphora, in order 
that God may not be angered [provoked to just indignation], love may not be 
injured, the enemies of God’s Word be not strengthened, nor the weak in faith 
offended.
26] 1. Therefore we reject and condemn as wrong when the ordinances of men in 
themselves are regarded as a service or part of the service of God.
27] 2. We reject and condemn also as wrong when these ordinances are by coercion 
forced upon the congregation of God as necessary.
28] 3. We reject and condemn also as wrong the opinion of those who hold (what 
tends to the detriment of the truth) that at a time of persecution we may comply 
with the enemies of the holy Gospel in [restoring] such adiaphora, or come to an 
agreement with them.
The Lutheran Confessions
586
29] 4. We likewise regard it as a sin that deserves to be rebuked when in time of 
persecution anything is done either in indifferent matters or in doctrine, and in 
what otherwise pertains to religion, for the sake of the enemies of the Gospel, in 
word and act, contrary and opposed to the Christian confession.
30] 5. We reject and condemn also [the madness] when these adiaphora are abrogat-
ed in such a manner as though it were not free to the congregation [church] of God 
at any time and place to employ one or more in Christian liberty, according to its 
circumstances, as may be most useful to the Church.
31] Thus [According to this doctrine] the churches will not condemn one another 
because of dissimilarity of ceremonies when, in Christian liberty, one has less or 
more of them, provided they are otherwise agreed with one another in the doctrine 
and all its articles, also in the right use of the holy Sacraments, according to the 
well-known saying: Dissonantia ieiunii non dissolvit consonantiam fidei; “Disagree-
ment in fasting does not destroy agreement in the faith.”
XI. Election
1] Although among the theologians of the Augsburg Confession there has not 
occurred as yet any public dissension whatever concerning the eternal election 
of the children of God that has caused offense, and has become wide-spread, yet 
since this article has been brought into very painful controversy in other places, 
and even among our theologians there has been some agitation concerning it; 
moreover, since the same expressions were not always employed concerning it 
by the theologians; therefore, in order, by the aid of divine grace, to prevent 
disagreement and separation on its account in the future among our successors, we, 
as much as in us lies, have desired also to present an explanation of the same here, 
so that every one may know what is our unanimous doctrine, faith, and confession 
also concerning this article. 2] For the doctrine concerning this article, if taught 
from, and according to, the pattern of the divine Word [and analogy of God’s 
Word and of faith], neither can nor should be regarded as useless or unnecessary, 
much less as offensive or injurious, because the Holy Scriptures not only in but one 
place and incidentally, but in many places, thoroughly treat and urge [explain] the 
same. 3] Moreover, we should not neglect or reject the doctrine of the divine Word 
on account of abuse or misunderstanding, but precisely on that account, in order 
to avert all abuse and misunderstanding, the true meaning should and must be 
explained from the foundation of the Scriptures; and the plain sum and substance 
[of the heavenly doctrine] concerning this article, accordingly, consists in the 
following points:
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
587
4] First, the distinction between the eternal foreknowledge of God and the eternal 
election of His children to eternal salvation, is carefully to be observed. For 
praescientia vel praevisio (foreknowledge or prevision), that is, that God sees and 
knows everything before it happens, which is called God’s foreknowledge [pre-
science], extends over all creatures, good and bad; namely, that He foresees and 
foreknows everything that is or will be, that is occurring or will occur, whether 
it be good or bad, since before God all things, whether they be past or future, are 
manifest and present. Thus it is written, Matt. 10:29: Are not two sparrows sold for 
a farthing? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. And 
Ps. 139:16: Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; and in Thy book all 
my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there 
were none of them. Also Is. 37:28: I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy 
coming in, and thy rage against Me.
5] The eternal election of God, however, vel praedestinatio (or predestination), 
that is, God’s ordination to salvation, does not extend at once over the godly and 
the wicked, but only over the children of God, who were elected and ordained to 
eternal life before the foundation of the world was laid, as Paul says, Eph. 1:4. 5: He 
hath chosen us in Him, having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by 
Jesus Christ.
6] The foreknowledge of God (praescientia) foresees and foreknows also that which 
is evil; however, not in such a manner as though it were God’s gracious will that it 
should happen; but all that the perverse, wicked will of the devil and of men wills 
and desires to undertake and do, God sees and knows before; and His praescientia, 
that is, foreknowledge, observes its order also in wicked acts or works, inasmuch as 
a limit and measure is fixed by God to the evil which God does not will, how far it 
should go, and how long it should last, when and how He will hinder and punish 
it; for all of this God the Lord so overrules that it must redound to the glory of 
the divine name and to the salvation of His elect, and the godless, on that account, 
must be put to confusion.
7] However, the beginning and cause of evil is not God’s foreknowledge (for God 
does not create and effect [or work] evil, neither does He help or promote it); 
but the wicked, perverse will of the devil and of men [is the cause of evil], as it is 
written Hos. 13:9: O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in Me is thy help. Also: 
Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness. Ps. 5:4.
8] The eternal election of God, however, not only foresees and foreknows the 
salvation of the elect, but is also, from the gracious will and pleasure of God in 
Christ Jesus, a cause which procures, works, helps, and promotes our salvation 
The Lutheran Confessions
588
and what pertains thereto; and upon this [divine predestination] our salvation is 
so founded that the gates of hell cannot prevail against it, Matt. 16:18, as is written 
John 10:28: Neither shall any man pluck My sheep out of My hand. And again, Acts 
13:48: And as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.
9] Nor is this eternal election or ordination of God to eternal life to be considered 
in God’s secret, inscrutable counsel in such a bare manner as though it comprised 
nothing further, or as though nothing more belonged to it, and nothing more were 
to be considered in it, than that God foresaw who and how many were to be saved, 
who and how many were to be damned, or that He only held a [sort of military] 
muster, thus: “This one shall be saved, that one shall be damned; this one shall 
remain steadfast [in faith to the end], that one shall not remain steadfast.”
10] For from this [notion] many derive and conceive strange, dangerous, 
and pernicious thoughts, which occasion and strengthen either security and 
impenitence or despondency and despair, so that they fall into troublesome 
thoughts and [for thus some think, with peril to themselves, nay, even sometimes] 
say: Since, before the foundation of the world was laid, Eph. 1:4, God has fore-
known [predestinated] His elect to salvation, and God’s foreknowledge [election] 
cannot fail nor be hindered or changed by any one, Is. 14:27; Rom. 9:19, therefore, 
if I am foreknown [elected] to salvation, nothing can injure me with respect to it, 
even though I practise all sorts of sin and shame without repentance, have no re-
gard for the Word and Sacraments, concern myself neither with repentance, faith, 
prayer, nor godliness; but I shall and must be saved nevertheless, because God’s 
foreknowledge [election] must come to pass. If, however, I am not foreknown [pre-
destinated], it helps me nothing anyway, even though I would occupy myself with 
the Word, repent, believe, etc.; for I cannot hinder or change God’s foreknowledge 
[predestination].
11] And indeed also to godly hearts, even when, by God’s grace they have repen-
tance, faith, and a good purpose [of living in a godly manner], such thoughts occur 
as these: If you are not foreknown [predestinated or elected] from eternity to 
salvation, everything [your every effort and entire labor] is of no avail. This occurs 
especially when they view their weakness and the examples of those who have not 
persevered [in faith to the end], but have fallen away again [from true godliness to 
ungodliness, and have become apostates].
12] To this false delusion and [dangerous] thought we should oppose the following 
clear argument, which is sure and cannot fail, namely: Since all Scripture, given by 
inspiration of God, is to serve, not for [cherishing] security and impenitence, but 
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 2 Tim. 3:16; also, since 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
589
everything in God’s Word has been prescribed to us, not that we should thereby 
be driven to despair, but that we, through patience and comfort of the Scriptures, 
might have hope, Rom. 15:4, therefore it is without any doubt in no way the sound 
sense or right use of the doctrine concerning the eternal foreknowledge of God 
that either impenitence or despair should be occasioned or strengthened thereby. 
Accordingly, the Scriptures teach this doctrine in no other way than to direct us 
thereby to the [revealed] Word, Eph. 1:13; 1 Cor. 1:7; exhort to repentance, 2 Tim. 
3:16; urge to godliness, Eph. 1:14; John 15:3; strengthen faith and assure us of our 
salvation, Eph. 1:13; John 10:27f ; 2 Thess. 2:13f.
13] Therefore, if we wish to think or speak correctly and profitably concerning 
eternal election, or the predestination and ordination of the children of God 
to eternal life, we should accustom ourselves not to speculate concerning the 
bare, secret, concealed, inscrutable foreknowledge of God, but how the counsel, 
purpose, and ordination of God in Christ Jesus, who is the true Book of Life, is 
revealed to us through the Word, 14] namely, that the entire doctrine concerning 
the purpose, counsel, will, and ordination of God pertaining to our redemption, 
call, justification, and salvation should be taken together; as Paul treats and has 
explained this article Rom. 8:29f ; Eph. 1:4f , as also Christ in the parable, Matt. 
22:1ff , namely, that God in His purpose and counsel ordained [decreed]:
15] 1. That the human race is truly redeemed and reconciled with God through 
Christ, who, by His faultless [innocency] obedience, suffering, and death, has 
merited for us the righteousness which avails before God, and eternal life.
16] 2. That such merit and benefits of Christ shall be presented, offered, and 
distributed to us through His Word and Sacraments.
17] 3. That by His Holy Ghost, through the Word, when it is preached, heard, 
and pondered, He will be efficacious and active in us, convert hearts to true 
repentance, and preserve them in the true faith.
18] 4. That He will justify all those who in true repentance receive Christ by a true 
faith, and will receive them into grace, the adoption of sons, and the inheritance of 
eternal life.
19] 5. That He will also sanctify in love those who are thus justified, as St. Paul says, 
Eph. 1:4.
20] 6. That He also will protect them in their great weakness against the devil, the 
world, and the flesh, and rule and lead them in His ways, raise them again [place

His hand beneath them], when they stumble, comfort them under the cross and in 
temptation, and preserve them [for life eternal].
21] 7. That He will also strengthen, increase, and support to the end the good work 
which He has begun in them, if they adhere to God’s Word, pray diligently, abide 
in God’s goodness [grace], and faithfully use the gifts received.
22] 8. That finally He will eternally save and glorify in life eternal those whom He 
has elected, called, and justified.
23] And [indeed] in this His counsel, purpose, and ordination God has prepared 
salvation not only in general, but has in grace considered and chosen to salvation 
each and every person of the elect who are to be saved through Christ, also 
ordained that in the way just mentioned He will, by His grace, gifts, and efficacy, 
bring them thereto [make them participants of eternal salvation], aid, promote, 
strengthen, and preserve them.
24] All this, according to the Scriptures, is comprised in the doctrine concerning 
the eternal election of God to adoption and eternal salvation, and is to be 
understood by it, and never excluded nor omitted, when we speak of God’s pur-
pose, predestination, election, and ordination to salvation. And when our thoughts 
concerning this article are thus formed according to the Scriptures, we can by 
God’s grace simply [and correctly] adapt ourselves to it [and advantageously treat 
of it].
25] This also belongs to the further explanation and salutary use of the doctrine 
concerning God’s foreknowledge [predestination] to salvation: Since only the elect, 
whose names are written in the book of life, are saved, how, we can know, whence 
and whereby we can perceive who are the elect that can and should receive this 
doctrine for comfort.
26] And of this we should not judge according to our reason, nor according to the 
Law or from any external appearance. Neither should we attempt to investigate 
the secret, concealed abyss of divine predestination, but should give heed to the 
revealed will of God. For He has made known unto us the mystery of His will, and 
made it manifest through Christ that it might be preached, Eph. 1:9ff ; 2 Tim. 1:9f.
27] This, however, is revealed to us in the manner as Paul says, Rom. 8:29f : Whom 
God predestinated, elected, and foreordained, He also called. Now, God does not 
call without means, but through the Word, as He has commanded repentance and

remission of sins to be preached in His name, Luke 24:47. St. Paul also testifies 
to like effect when he writes: We are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did 
beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ’s stead, Be ye reconciled to God. 2 Cor. 
5:20. And the guests whom the King will have at the wedding of His Son He calls 
through His ministers sent forth, Matt. 22:2ff , some at the first and some at the 
second, third, sixth, ninth, and even at the eleventh hour, Matt. 20:3ff
28] Therefore, if we wish to consider our eternal election to salvation with profit, 
we must in every way hold sturdily and firmly to this, that, as the preaching of 
repentance, so also the promise of the Gospel is universalis (universal), that is, it 
pertains to all men, Luke 24:47. For this reason Christ has commanded that repen-
tance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations. For 
God loved the world and gave His Son, John 3:16. Christ bore the sins of the world, 
John 1:29, gave His flesh for the life of the world, John 6:51; His blood is the propiti-
ation for the sins of the whole world, 1 John 1:7; 2:2. Christ says: Come unto Me, 
all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest, Matt. 11:28. God hath 
concluded them all in unbelief, that He might have mercy upon all, Rom. 11:32. The 
Lord is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance, 
2 Pet. 3:9. The same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon Him, Rom. 10:12. 
The righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all 
them that believe, Rom. 3:22. This is the will of Him that sent Me, that every one 
that seeth the Son and believeth on Him may have everlasting life, John 6:40. Like-
wise it is Christ’s command that to all in common to whom repentance is preached 
this promise of the Gospel also should be offered Luke 24:47; Mark 16:15.
29] And this call of God, which is made through the preaching of the Word, we 
should not regard as jugglery, but know that thereby God reveals His will, that 
in those whom He thus calls He will work through the Word, that they may be 
enlightened, converted, and saved. For the Word, whereby we are called, is a 
ministration of the Spirit, that gives the Spirit, or whereby the Spirit is given, 2 
Cor. 3:8, and a power of God unto salvation, Rom. 1:16. And since the Holy Ghost 
wishes to be efficacious through the Word, and to strengthen and give power and 
ability, it is God’s will that we should receive the Word, believe and obey it.
30] For this reason the elect are described thus, John 10:27f : My sheep hear My 
voice, and I know them, and they follow Me, and I give unto them eternal life. And 
Eph. 1:11. 13: Those who according to the purpose are predestinated to an inher-
itance hear the Gospel, believe in Christ, pray and give thanks, are sanctified in 
love, have hope, patience, and comfort under the cross, Rom. 8:25; and although all 
this is very weak in them, yet they hunger and thirst after righteousness, Matt. 5:6.
The Lutheran Confessions
592
31] Thus the Spirit of God gives to the elect the testimony that they are children 
of God, and when they do not know for what they should pray as they ought, He 
intercedes for them with groanings that cannot be uttered, Rom. 8:16. 26.
32] Thus, also, Holy Scripture testifies that God, who has called us, is so faithful 
that, when He has begun the good work in us, He also will preserve it to the end 
and perfect it, if we ourselves do not turn from Him, but firmly retain to the end 
the work begun, for which He has promised His grace, 1 Cor. 1:9; Phil. 1:6 [ 1 Pet. 
5:10 ]; 2 Pet. 3:9; Heb. 3:2.
33] With this revealed will of God we should concern ourselves, follow and be 
diligently engaged upon [eagerly con] it, because through the Word, whereby He 
calls us, the Holy Ghost bestows grace, power, and ability to this end, and should 
not [attempt to] sound the abyss of God’s hidden predestination, as it is written in 
Luke 13:24, where one asks: Lord, are there few that be saved? and Christ answers: 
Strive to enter in at the strait gate. Accordingly, Luther says [in the Preface to the 
Epistle to the Romans]: Follow the Epistle to the Romans in its order, concern 
yourself first with Christ and His Gospel, that you may recognize your sins and 
His grace; next, that you contend with sin, as Paul teaches from the first to the 
eighth chapter; then, when in the eighth chapter you will come into [will have been 
exercised by] temptation under the cross and afflictions, this will teach you in the 
ninth, tenth, and eleventh chapters how consolatory predestination is, etc.
34] However, that many are called and few chosen is not owing to the fact that 
the call of God, which is made through the Word, had the meaning as though God 
said: Outwardly, through the Word, I indeed call to My kingdom all of you to 
whom I give My Word; however, in My heart I do not mean this with respect to 
all, but only with respect to a few; for it is My will that the greatest part of those 
whom I call through the Word shall not be enlightened nor converted, but be and 
remain damned, although through the Word, in the call, I declare Myself to them 
otherwise. Hoc enim esset Deo contradictorias voluntates affingere, that is: 35] For 
this would be to assign contradictory wills to God. That is, in this way it would 
be taught that God, who surely is Eternal Truth, would be contrary to Himself 
[or say one thing, but revolve another in His heart], while, on the contrary, God 
[rebukes and] punishes also in men this wickedness [this wantonness, this dishones-
ty] when a person declares himself to one purpose, and thinks and means another 
in the heart, Ps. 5:9; 12:2f. 36] Thereby also the necessary consolatory foundation is 
rendered altogether uncertain and void, as we are daily reminded and admonished 
that only from God’s Word, through which He treats with us and calls us, we are to 
learn and conclude what His will towards us is, and that we should believe and not 
doubt what it affirms to us and promises.
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
593
37] For this reason also Christ causes the promise of the Gospel not only to be 
offered in general, but He seals it through the Sacraments which He attaches as 
seals of the promise, and thereby confirms it [the certainty of the promise of the 
Gospel] to every believer in particular.
38] On this account, as the Augsburg Confession in Art. 11 says, we also retain 
private absolution, and teach that it is God’s command that we believe such abso-
lution, and should regard it as sure that, when we believe the word of absolution, 
we are as truly reconciled to God as though we had heard a voice from heaven, as 
the Apology explains this article. This consolation would be entirely taken from 
us if we were not to infer the will of God towards us from the call which is made 
through the Word and through the Sacraments.
39] There would also be overthrown and taken from us the foundation that 
the Holy Ghost wishes certainly to be present with the Word preached, heard, 
considered, and to be efficacious and operate through it. Therefore the meaning is 
not at all the one referred to above, namely, that the elect are to be such [among 
the elect are to be numbered such] as even despise the Word of God, thrust it from 
them, blaspheme and persecute it, Matt. 22:6; Acts 13:46; or, when they hear it, 
harden their hearts, Heb. 4:2. 7; resist the Holy Ghost, Acts 7:51; without repen-
tance persevere in sins, Luke 14:18; do not truly believe in Christ, Mark 16:16; only 
make [godliness] an outward show, Matt. 7:22; 22:12; or seek other ways to righ-
teousness and salvation outside of Christ, Rom. 9:31. 40] Moreover, even as God 
has ordained in His [eternal] counsel that the Holy Ghost should call, enlighten, 
and convert the elect through the Word, and that He will justify and save all those 
who by true faith receive Christ, so He also determined in His counsel that He will 
harden, reprobate, and condemn those who are called through the Word, if they 
reject the Word and resist the Holy Ghost, who wishes to be efficacious and to 
work in them through the Word and persevere therein. And in this manner many 
are called, but few are chosen.
41] For few receive the Word and follow it; the greatest number despise the Word, 
and will not come to the wedding, Matt. 22:3ff The cause for this contempt for 
the Word is not God’s foreknowledge [or predestination], but the perverse will of 
man, which rejects or perverts the means and instrument of the Holy Ghost, which 
God offers him through the call, and resists the Holy Ghost, who wishes to be 
efficacious, and works through the Word, as Christ says: How often would I have 
gathered you together, and ye would not! Matt. 23:37.
42] Thus many receive the Word with joy, but afterwards fall away again, Luke 8:13. 
But the cause is not as though God were unwilling to grant grace for perseverance 
The Lutheran Confessions
594
to those in whom He has begun the good work, for that is contrary to St. Paul, 
Phil. 1:6; but the cause is that they wilfully turn away again from the holy com-
mandment [of God], grieve and embitter the Holy Ghost, implicate themselves 
again in the filth of the world, and garnish again the habitation of the heart for the 
devil. With them the last state is worse than the first, 2 Pet. 2:10. 20; Eph. 4:30; Heb. 
10:26; Luke 11:25.
43] Thus far is the mystery of predestination revealed to us in God’s Word, and if 
we abide thereby and cleave thereto, it is a very useful, salutary, consolatory doc-
trine; for it establishes very effectually the article that we are justified and saved 
without all works and merits of ours, purely out of grace alone, for Christ’s sake. 
For before the time of the world, before we existed, yea, before the foundation of 
the world was laid, when, of course, we could do nothing good, we were according 
to God’s purpose chosen by grace in Christ to salvation, Rom. 9:11; 2 Tim. 1:9. 44] 
Moreover, all opiniones (opinions) and erroneous doctrines concerning the powers 
of our natural will are thereby overthrown, because God in His counsel, before 
the time of the world, decided and ordained that He Himself, by the power of His 
Holy Ghost, would produce and work in us, through the Word, everything that 
pertains to our conversion.
45] Thus this doctrine affords also the excellent, glorious consolation that God 
was so greatly concerned about the conversion, righteousness, and salvation of 
every Christian, and so faithfully purposed it [provided therefor] that before 
the foundation of the world was laid, He deliberated concerning it, and in His 
[secret] purpose ordained how He would bring me thereto [call and lead me to 
salvation], and preserve me therein. Also, that He wished to secure my salvation 
so well and certainly that, since through the weakness and wickedness of our flesh 
it could easily be lost from our hands, or through craft and might of the devil and 
the world be snatched and taken from us, He ordained it in His eternal purpose, 
which cannot fail or be overthrown, and placed it for preservation in the almighty 
hand of our Savior Jesus Christ, from which no one can pluck us, John 10:28. 46]
Hence Paul also says, Rom. 8:28. 39: Because we have been called according to the 
purpose of God, who will separate us from the love of God in Christ? [Paul builds 
the certainty of our blessedness upon the foundation of the divine purpose, when, 
from our being called according to the purpose of God, he infers that no one can 
separate us, etc.]
48] Moreover, this doctrine affords glorious consolation under the cross and 
amid temptations, namely, that God in His counsel, before the time of the world, 
determined and decreed that He would assist us in all distresses [anxieties and 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
595
perplexities], grant patience [under the cross], give consolation, excite [nourish 
and encourage] hope, and produce such an outcome as would contribute to our 
salvation. Also, as Paul in a very consolatory way treats this, Rom. 8:28. 29. 35. 38. 
39, that God in His purpose has ordained before the time of the world by what 
crosses and sufferings He would conform every one of His elect to the image of 
His Son, and that to every one His cross shall and must work together for good, 
because they are called according to the purpose, whence Paul has concluded that 
it is certain and indubitable that neither tribulation, nor distress, nor death, nor 
life, etc., shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus, 
our Lord.
50] This article also affords a glorious testimony that the Church of God will 
exist and abide in opposition to all the gates of hell, and likewise teaches which is 
the true Church of God, lest we be offended by the great authority [and majestic 
appearance] of the false Church, Rom. 9:24. 25.
51] From this article also powerful admonitions and warnings are derived, as Luke 
7:30: They rejected the counsel of God against themselves. Luke 14:24: I say unto 
you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper. Also Matt. 
20:16: Many be called, but few chosen. Also Luke 8:8. 18: He that hath ears to hear, 
let him hear, and: Take heed how ye hear. Thus the doctrine concerning this article 
can be employed profitably, comfortingly, and savingly [and can be transferred in 
many ways to our use].
52] But a distinction must be observed with especial care between that which is 
expressly revealed concerning it in God’s Word, and what is not revealed. For, in 
addition to what has been revealed in Christ concerning this, of which we have 
hitherto spoken, God has still kept secret and concealed much concerning this 
mystery, and reserved it for His wisdom and knowledge alone, which we should 
not investigate, nor should we indulge our thoughts in this matter, nor draw 
conclusions, nor inquire curiously, but should adhere [entirely] to the revealed 
Word [of God]. This admonition is most urgently needed.
53] For our curiosity has always much more pleasure in concerning itself with 
these matters [with investigating those things which are hidden and abstruse] 
than with what God has revealed to us concerning this in His Word, because we 
cannot harmonize it, which, moreover, we have not been commanded to do [since 
certain things occur in this mystery so intricate and involved that we are not able 
by the penetration of our natural ability to harmonize them; but this has not been 
demanded of us by God].
The Lutheran Confessions
596
54] Thus there is no doubt that God most exactly and certainly foresaw before the 
time of the world, and still knows, which of those that are called will believe or 
will not believe; also which of the converted will persevere [in faith] and which will 
not persevere; which will return after a fall [into grievous sins], and which will fall 
into obduracy [will perish in their sins]. So, too, the number, how many there are 
of these on either side, is beyond all doubt perfectly known to God. 55] However, 
since God has reserved this mystery for His wisdom, and has revealed nothing to 
us concerning it in His Word, much less commanded us to investigate it with our 
thoughts, but has earnestly discouraged us therefrom, Rom. 11:33ff , we should not 
reason in our thoughts, draw conclusions, nor inquire curiously into these matters, 
but should adhere to His revealed Word, to which He points us.
56] Thus without any doubt God also knows and has determined for every one the 
time and hour of his call and conversion [and when He will raise again one who has 
lapsed]. But since this has not been revealed to us, we have the command always 
to keep urging the Word, but to entrust the time and hour [of conversion] to God, 
Acts 1:7.
57] Likewise, when we see that God gives His Word at one place [to one kingdom 
or realm], but not at another [to another nation]; removes it from one place 
[people], and allows it to remain at another; also, that one is hardened, blinded, 
given over to a reprobate mind, while another, who is indeed in the same guilt, is 
converted again, etc.,-in these and similar questions Paul [Rom. 11:22ff ] 58] fixes 
a certain limit to us how far we should go, namely, that in the one part we should 
recognize God’s judgment [for He commands us to consider in those who perish 
the just judgment of God and the penalties of sins]. For they are well-deserved pen-
alties of sins when God so punishes a land or nation for despising His Word that 
the punishment extends also to their posterity, as is to be seen in the Jews. And 
thereby [by the punishments] God in some lands and persons exhibits His severity 
to those that are His [in order to indicate] what we all would have well deserved, 
and would be worthy and worth, since we act wickedly in opposition to God’s 
Word [are ungrateful for the revealed Word, and live unworthily of the Gospel] and 
often grieve the Holy Ghost sorely, in order that we may live in the fear of God, 
and acknowledge and praise God’s goodness, to the exclusion of, and contrary to, 
our merit in and with us, to whom He gives His Word, and with whom He leaves 
it, and whom He does not harden and reject.
60] For inasmuch as our nature has been corrupted by sin, and is worthy of, and 
subject to, God’s wrath and condemnation, God owes to us neither the Word, the 
Spirit, nor grace; and when He bestows these gifts out of grace, we often thrust 
them from us, and make ourselves unworthy of everlasting life, Acts 13:46. And this 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
597
His righteous, well-deserved judgment He displays in some countries, nations, and 
persons, in order that, when we are placed alongside of them and compared with 
them [and found to be most similar to them], we may learn the more diligently 
to recognize and praise God’s pure [immense], unmerited grace in the vessels of 
mercy.
61] For no injustice is done those who are punished and receive the wages of their 
sins; but in the rest, to whom God gives and preserves His Word, by which men are 
enlightened, converted, and preserved, God commends His pure [immense] grace 
and mercy, without their merit.
62] When we proceed thus far in this article, we remain on the right [safe and 
royal] way, as it is written Hos. 13:9: O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in Me 
is thy help.
63] However, as regards these things in this disputation which would soar too high 
and beyond these limits, we should, with Paul, place the finger upon our lips, and 
remember and say, Rom. 9:20: O man, who art thou that repliest against God?
64] For that we neither can nor should investigate and fathom everything in 
this article, the great Apostle Paul declares [teaches by his own example], who, 
after having argued much concerning this article from the revealed Word of 
God, as soon as he comes to the point where he shows what God has reserved 
for His hidden wisdom concerning this mystery, suppresses and cuts it off with 
the following words, Rom. 11:33f : O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom 
and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past 
finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord? that is, outside of and 
beyond that which He has revealed to us in His Word.
65] Accordingly, this eternal election of God is to be considered in Christ, and 
not outside of or without Christ. For in Christ, the Apostle Paul testifies, Eph. 1:4f 
, He hath chosen us before the foundation of the world, as it is written: He hath 
made us accepted in the Beloved. This election, however, is revealed from heaven 
through the preaching of His Word, when the Father says, Matt. 17:6: This is My 
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him. And Christ says, Matt. 11:28: 
Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. And 
concerning the Holy Ghost Christ says, John 16:14: He shalt glorify Me; for He shall 
receive of Mine, and shall show it unto you. 66] Thus the entire Holy Trinity, God 
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, directs all men to Christ, as to the Book of Life, in 
whom they should seek the eternal election of the Father. For this has been decided 
by the Father from eternity, that whom He would save He would save through 
The Lutheran Confessions
598
Christ, as He [Christ] Himself says, John 14:6: No man cometh unto the Father but 
by Me. And again, John 10:9: I am the Door; by Me, if any man enter in, he shall be 
saved.
67] However, Christ, as the only-begotten Son of God, who is in the bosom of 
the Father, has announced to us the will of the Father, and thus also our eternal 
election to eternal life, namely, when He says, Mark 1:15: Repent ye, and believe 
the Gospel; the kingdom of God is at hand. Likewise He says, John 6:40: This is 
the will of Him that sent Me, that every one which seeth the Son and believeth on 
Him may have everlasting life. And again [John 3:16]: God so loved the world, etc. 
[that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not 
perish, but have everlasting life].
68] This proclamation the Father wishes all men to hear and desires that they come 
to Christ; and these Christ does not drive from Him, as it is written John 6:37: Him 
that cometh to Me I will in no wise cast out.
69] And in order that we may come to Christ, the Holy Ghost works true faith 
through the hearing of the Word, as the apostle testifies when he says, Rom. 10:17: 
Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God, [namely] when it is 
preached in its truth and purity.
70] Therefore, whoever would be saved should not trouble or harass himself with 
thoughts concerning the secret counsel of God, as to whether he also is elected and 
ordained to eternal life, with which miserable Satan usually attacks and annoys 
godly hearts. But they should hear Christ [and look upon Him as the Book of Life 
in which is written the eternal election], who is the Book of Life and of God’s eter-
nal election of all of God’s children to eternal life: He testifies to all men without 
distinction that it is God’s will that all men should come to Him who labor and 
are heavy laden with sin, in order that He may give them rest and save them, Matt. 
11:28.
71] According to this doctrine of His they should abstain from their sins, repent, 
believe His promise, and entirely trust in Him; and since we cannot do this by 
ourselves, of our own powers, the Holy Ghost desires to work these things, namely, 
repentance and faith, in us through the Word and Sacraments. 72] And in order 
that we may attain this, persevere in it, and remain steadfast, we should implore 
God for His grace, which He has promised us in Holy Baptism, and, no doubt, He 
will impart it to us according to His promise, as He has said, Luke 11:11ff : If a son 
shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a 
fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
599
a scorpion? If ye, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, 
how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask 
Him!
73] And since the Holy Ghost dwells in the elect, who have become believers, as in 
His temple, and is not idle in them, but impels the children of God to obedience 
to God’s commands, believers, likewise, should not be idle, and much less resist the 
impulse of God’s Spirit, but should exercise themselves in all Christian virtues, in 
all godliness, modesty, temperance, patience, brotherly love, and give all diligence 
to make their calling and election sure, in order that they may doubt the less con-
cerning it, the more they experience the power and strength of the Spirit within 
them. 74] For the Spirit bears witness to the elect that they are God’s children, 
Rom. 8:16. And although they sometimes fall into temptation so grievous that 
they imagine they perceive no more power of the indwelling Spirit of God, and 
say with David, Ps. 31:22: I said in my haste, I am cut off from before Thine eyes, 
yet they should, without regard to what they experience in themselves, again [be 
encouraged and] say with David, as is written ibidem, in the words immediately 
following: Nevertheless Thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried 
unto Thee.
75] And since our election to eternal life is founded not upon our godliness or 
virtue, but alone upon the merit of Christ and the gracious will of His Father, who 
cannot deny Himself, because He is unchangeable in will and essence, therefore, 
when His children depart from obedience and stumble, He has them called 
again to repentance through the Word, and the Holy Ghost wishes thereby to 
be efficacious in them for conversion; and when they turn to Him again in true 
repentance by a right faith, He will always manifest the old paternal heart to all 
those who tremble at His Word and from their heart turn again to Him, as it is 
written, Jer. 3:1: If a man put away his wife, and she go from him and become an-
other man’s, shall he return unto her again? Shall not that land be greatly polluted? 
But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to Me, saith the 
Lord.
76] Moreover, the declaration, John 6:44, that no one can come to Christ except 
the Father draw him, is right and true. However, the Father will not do this with-
out means, but has ordained for this purpose His Word and Sacraments as ordinary 
means and instruments; and it is the will neither of the Father nor of the Son that 
a man should not hear or should despise the preaching of His Word, and wait for 
the drawing of the Father without the Word and Sacraments. For the Father draws 
indeed by the power of His Holy Ghost, however, according to His usual order [the 
order decreed and instituted by Himself], by the hearing of His holy, divine Word, 
The Lutheran Confessions
600
as with a net, by which the elect are plucked from the jaws of the devil. 77] Every 
poor sinner should therefore repair thereto [to holy preaching], hear it attentively, 
and not doubt the drawing of the Father. For the Holy Ghost will be with His 
Word in His power, and work by it; and that is the drawing of the Father.
78] But the reason why not all who hear it believe, and some are therefore 
condemned the more deeply [eternally to severer punishments], is not because God 
had begrudged them their salvation; but it is their own fault, as they have heard 
the Word in such a manner as not to learn, but only to despise, blaspheme, and 
disgrace it, and have resisted the Holy Ghost, who through the Word wished to 
work in them, as was the case at the time of Christ with the Pharisees and their 
adherents. 79] Hence the apostle distinguishes with especial care the work of God, 
who alone makes vessels of honor, and the work of the devil and of man, who by 
the instigation of the devil, and not of God, has made himself a vessel of dishonor. 
For thus it is written, Rom. 9:22f : God endured with much longsuffering the 
vessels of wrath fitted to destruction, that He might make known the riches of His 
glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had afore prepared unto glory.
80] Here, then, the apostle clearly says that God endured with much long-suffering 
the vessels of wrath, but does not say that He made them vessels of wrath; for if 
this had been His will, He would not have required any great long-suffering for it. 
The fault, however, that they are fitted for destruction belongs to the devil and to 
men themselves, and not to God.
81] For all preparation for condemnation is by the devil and man, through sin, 
and in no respect by God, who does not wish that any man be damned; how, then, 
should He Himself prepare any man for condemnation? For as God is not a cause 
of sins, so, too, He is no cause of punishment, of damnation; but the only cause 
of damnation is sin; for the wages of sin is death, Rom. 6:23. And as God does not 
will sin, and has no pleasure in sin, so He does not wish the death of the sinner 
either, Ezek. 33:11, nor has He pleasure in his condemnation. For He is not willing 
that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance, 2 Pet. 3:9. So, too, 
it is written in Ezek. 18:23; 33:11: As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in 
the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. 82] And 
St. Paul testifies in clear words that from vessels of dishonor vessels of honor may 
be made by God’s power and working, when he writes thus, 2 Tim. 2:21: If a man, 
therefore, purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified and 
meet for the Master’s use, and prepared unto every good work. For he who is to 
purge himself must first have been unclean, and hence a vessel of dishonor. But 
concerning the vessels of mercy he says clearly that the Lord Himself has prepared 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
601
them for glory, which he does not say concerning the damned, who themselves, and 
not God, have prepared themselves as vessels of damnation.
83] Moreover, it is to be diligently considered that when God punishes sin with 
sins, that is, when He afterwards punishes with obduracy and blindness those who 
had been converted, because of their subsequent security, impenitence, and wilful 
sins, this should not be interpreted to mean that it never had been God’s good 
pleasure that such persons should come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved. 
For both these facts are God’s revealed will:
First, that God will receive into grace all who repent and believe in Christ.
Secondly, that He also will punish those who wilfully turn away from the holy com-
mandment, and again entangle themselves in the filth of the world, 2 Pet. 2:20, and 
garnish their hearts for Satan, Luke 11:25f , and do despite unto the Spirit of God, 
Heb. 10:29, and that they shall be hardened, blinded, and eternally condemned if 
they persist therein.
84] Accordingly, even Pharaoh (of whom it is written, Ex. 9:16; Rom. 9:17: In very 
deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to show in thee My power, and that 
My name may be declared throughout all the earth) perished, not because God had 
begrudged him salvation, or because it had been His good pleasure that he should 
be damned and lost. For God is not willing that any should perish, 2 Pet. 3:9; He 
also has no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his 
way and live, Ezek. 33:11.
85] But that God hardened Pharaoh’s heart, namely, that Pharaoh always sinned 
again and again, and became the more obdurate, the more he was admonished, 
that was a punishment of his antecedent sin and horrible tyranny, which in many 
and manifold ways he practised inhumanly and against the accusations of his heart 
towards the children of Israel. And since God caused His Word to be preached 
and His will to be proclaimed to him, and Pharaoh nevertheless wilfully reared up 
straightway against 
all admonitions and warnings, God withdrew His hand from him, and thus his 
heart became hardened and obdurate, and God executed His judgment upon him; 
for he was guilty of nothing else than hell-fire. 86] Accordingly, the holy apostle 
also introduces the example of Pharaoh for no other reason than to prove by it 
the justice of God which He exercises towards the impenitent and despisers of 
His Word; by no means, however, has he intended or understood it to mean that 
God begrudged salvation to him or any person, but had so ordained him to eternal 
The Lutheran Confessions
602
damnation in His secret counsel that he should not be able, or that it should not be 
possible for him, to be saved.
87] By this doctrine and explanation of the eternal and saving choice 
[predestination] of the elect children of God His own glory is entirely and fully 
given to God, that in Christ He saves us out of pure [and free] mercy, without any 
merits or good works of ours, according to the purpose of His will, as it is written 
Eph. 1:5f : Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ 
to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory 
of His grace, wherein He hath made us accepted in the Beloved. 88] Therefore it is 
false and wrong [conflicts with the Word of God] when it is taught that not alone 
the mercy of God and the most holy merit of Christ, but that also in us there is 
a cause of God’s election, on account of which God has chosen us to eternal life. 
For not only before we had done anything good, but also before we were born, 
yea, even before the foundations of the world were laid, He elected us in Christ; 
and that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but 
of Him that calleth, it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger; as it is 
written concerning this matter, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated, Rom. 
9:11ff.; Gen. 25:23; Mal. 1:2f.
89] Moreover, this doctrine gives no one a cause either for despondency or for a 
shameless, dissolute life, namely, when men are taught that they must seek eternal 
election in Christ and His holy Gospel, as in the Book of Life, which excludes 
no penitent sinner, but beckons and calls all the poor, heavy-laden, and troubled 
sinners [who are disturbed by the sense of God’s wrath], to repentance and the 
knowledge of their sins and to faith in Christ, and promises the Holy Ghost for 
purification and renewal, 90] and thus gives the most enduring consolation to all 
troubled, afflicted men, that they know that their salvation is not placed in their 
own hands,-for otherwise they would lose it much more easily than was the case 
with Adam and Eve in paradise, yea, every hour and moment,–but in the gracious 
election of God, which He has revealed to us in Christ, out of whose hand no man 
shall pluck us, John 10:28; 2 Tim. 2:19.
91] Accordingly, if any one presents the doctrine concerning the gracious election 
of God in such a manner that troubled Christians cannot derive comfort from it, 
but are thereby incited to despair, or that the impenitent are confirmed in their 
wantonness, it is undoubtedly sure and true that such a doctrine is taught, not 
according to the Word and will of God, but according to [the blind judgment of 
human] reason and the instigation of the devil.
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
603
92] For, as the apostle testifies, Rom. 15:4: Whatsoever things were written afore-
time were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the 
Scriptures might have hope. But when this consolation and hope are weakened 
or entirely removed by Scripture, it is certain that it is understood and explained 
contrary to the will and meaning of the Holy Ghost.
93] By this simple, correct [clear], useful explanation which has a firm and good 
foundation in God’s revealed will, we abide; we flee from, and shun, all lofty, acute 
questions and disputations [useless for edifying]; and reject and condemn whatever 
is contrary to these simple, useful explanations.
94] So much concerning the controverted articles which have been discussed for 
many years already among the theologians of the Augsburg Confession, in which 
some have erred and severe controversiae (controversies), that is, religious disputes, 
have arisen.
95] From this our explanation, friends and enemies, and therefore every one, may 
clearly infer that we have no intention of yielding aught of the eternal, immutable 
truth of God for the sake of temporal peace, tranquillity, and unity (which, 
moreover, is not in our power to do). Nor would such peace and unity, since it 
is devised against the truth and for its suppression, have any permanency. Still 
less are we inclined to adorn and conceal a corruption of the pure doctrine and 
manifest, condemned errors. 96] But we entertain heartfelt pleasure and love for, 
and are on our part sincerely inclined and anxious to advance, that unity according 
to our utmost power, by which His glory remains to God uninjured, nothing of the 
divine truth of the Holy Gospel is surrendered, no room is given to the least error, 
poor sinners are brought to true, genuine repentance, raised up by faith, confirmed 
in new obedience, and thus justified and eternally saved alone through the sole 
merit of Christ.
XII. Other Factions, Heresies and Sects.
Which Never Embraced the Augsburg Confession.
1] However, as regards the sects and factions [sectarists and heretics] which never 
have embraced the Augsburg Confession, and of which express mention has not 
been made in this our explanation, such as are the Anabaptists, Schwenckfeldians, 
New Arians, and Anti-Trinitarians, 2] whose errors have been unanimously 
condemned by all churches of the Augsburg Confession, we have not wished to 
make particular and especial mention of them in this explanation, for the reason 
The Lutheran Confessions
604
that at the present time this has been our only aim [that we might above all refute 
the charges of our adversaries, the Papists].
3] Since our opponents alleged with shameless mouths, and decried throughout 
all the world our churches and their teachers, claiming that not two preachers are 
found who agree in each and every article of the Augsburg Confession, but that 
they are rent asunder and separated from one another to such an extent that they 
themselves no longer know what is the Augsburg Confession and its proper [true, 
genuine, and germane] sense; 4] we have not made a joint confession only in brief 
words or names, but wished to make a pure, clear, distinct declaration concerning 
all the disputed articles which have been discussed and controverted only among 
the theologians of the Augsburg Confession, 5] in order that every one may see 
that we do not wish in a cunning manner to dissemble or cover up all this, or to 
come to an agreement only in appearance; 6] but to remedy the matter thoroughly, 
and have wished to set forth our opinion of these matters in such a manner that 
even our adversaries themselves must confess that in all this we abide by the 
true, simple, natural, and proper sense of the Augsburg Confession, in which we 
desire, moreover, by God’s grace, to persevere constantly until our end; and so 
far as it depends on our service, we will not connive at or be silent, lest anything 
contrary to the same [the genuine and sacred sense of the Augsburg Confession] is 
introduced into our churches and schools, in which the almighty God and Father 
of our Lord Jesus Christ has appointed us teachers and pastors.
7] However, lest there be silently ascribed to us the condemned errors of the above 
enumerated factions and sects [“of which evil the papistic tyranny, which perse-
cutes the pure doctrine is the chief cause”], 8] -which as is the nature of such spir-
its, for the most part, secretly stole in at localities, and especially at a time when 
no place or room was given to the pure Word of the holy Gospel, but all its sincere 
teachers and confessors were persecuted, and the deep darkness of the Papacy still 
prevailed, and poor simple men who could not help but feel the manifest idolatry 
and false faith of the Papacy, in their simplicity, alas! embraced whatever was called 
the Gospel, and was not papistic,-we could not forbear testifying also against them 
publicly, before all Christendom, that we have neither part nor fellowship with 
their errors, be they many or few, but reject and condemn them, one and all, as 
wrong and heretical, and contrary to the Scriptures of the prophets and apostles, 
and to our Christian Augsburg Confession, well grounded in God’s Word.
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
605
Erroneous Articles of the Anabaptists.
9] Namely, for instance, the erroneous, heretical doctrines of the Anabaptists, 
which are to be tolerated and allowed neither in the Church, nor in the 
commonwealth, nor in domestic life, when they teach:
10] 1. That our righteousness before God consists not only in the sole obedience 
and merit of Christ, but in our renewal and our own piety in which we walk before 
God; which they, for the most part, base upon their own peculiar ordinances and 
self-chosen spirituality, as upon a new sort of monkery.
11] 2. That children who are not baptized are not sinners before God, but righteous 
and innocent, and thus are saved in their innocency without Baptism, which they 
do not need. Accordingly, they deny and reject the entire doctrine concerning 
original sin and what belongs to it.
12] 3. That children are not to be baptized until they have attained the use of 
reason and can confess their faith themselves.
13] 4. That the children of Christians, since they have been born of Christian 
and believing parents, are holy and the children of God even without and before 
Baptism; and for this reason they neither attach much importance to the baptism 
of children nor encourage it, contrary to the express words of the promise, which 
extends only to those who keep God’s covenant and do not despise it, Gen. 17:9.
14] 5. That a congregation [church] in which sinners are still found is no true 
Christian assembly.
15] 6. That no sermon should be heard or attended in those churches in which the 
papal masses have previously been said.
16] 7. That no one should have anything to do with those ministers of the Church 
who preach the holy Gospel according to the Confession, and rebuke the errors of 
baptists; also, that no one should serve or in any way labor for them, but should 
flee from and shun them as perverters of God’s Word.
17] 8. That under the New Testament the magistracy is not a godly estate.
18] 9. That a Christian cannot with a good, inviolate conscience hold the office of 
magistrate.
The Lutheran Confessions
606
19] 10. That a Christian cannot without injury to conscience use the office of the 
magistracy in matters that may occur [when the matter so demands] against the 
wicked, neither can its subjects appeal to its power.
20] 11. That a Christian cannot with a good conscience take an oath before a court, 
nor with an oath do homage to his prince or hereditary sovereign.
21] 12. That magistrates cannot without injury to conscience inflict capital punish-
ment upon evil-doers.
22] 13. That a Christian cannot with a good conscience hold or possess any proper-
ty, but is in duty bound to devote it to the common treasury.
23] 14. That a Christian cannot with a good conscience be an inn-keeper, merchant, 
or cutler.
24] 15. That married persons may be divorced on account of faith [diversity of 
religion], and that the one may abandon the other, and be married to another of 
his own faith.
25] 16. That Christ did not assume His flesh and blood of the Virgin Mary, but 
brought them with Him from heaven.
26] 17. That He is not true, essential God either, but only has more and higher gifts 
and glory than other men.
27] And still more articles of like kind; for they are divided among themselves into 
many bands [sects], and one has more and another fewer errors, and thus their 
entire sect is in reality nothing but a new kind of monkery.
Erroneous Articles of the Schwenckfeldians.
28] Likewise, when the Schwenckfeldians assert:
29] 1. First, that all those have no knowledge of the reigning King of heaven, 
Christ, who regard Christ according to the flesh, or His assumed humanity, as 
a creature, and that the flesh of Christ has by exaltation so assumed all divine 
properties that in might, power, majesty, and glory He is in every respect, in degree 
and position of essence, equal to the Father and the eternal Word, so that there is 
The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord
607
the same essence, properties, will, and glory of both natures in Christ, and that the 
flesh of Christ belongs to the essence of the Holy Trinity.
30] 2. That the ministry of the Church, the Word preached and heard, is not a 
means whereby God the Holy Ghost teaches men, and works in them saving 
knowledge of Christ, conversion, repentance, faith, and new obedience.
31] 3. That the water of Baptism is not a means by which God the Lord seals 
adoption and works regeneration.
32] 4. That bread and wine in the Holy Supper are not means by which Christ 
distributes His body and blood.
33] 5. That a Christian man who is truly regenerated by God’s Spirit can in this life 
keep and fulfil the Law of God perfectly.
34] 6. That a congregation in which no public excommunication or regular process 
of the ban is observed, is no true Christian congregation [church].
35] 7. That the minister of the Church who is not on his part truly renewed, 
righteous, and godly cannot teach other men with profit or administer real, true 
sacraments.
Erroneous Articles of the New Arians.
36] Also, when the New Arians teach that Christ is not a true, essential, natural 
God, of one eternal divine essence with God the Father, but is only adorned with 
divine majesty inferior to, and beside, God the Father.
Erroneous Articles of the New Anti-Trinitarians.
37] 1. Also, when some Anti-Trinitarians reject and condemn the ancient approved 
symbola, Nicaenum et Athanasianum (the Nicene and Athanasian creeds), as 
regards both their sense and words, and teach that there is not only one eternal 
divine essence of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but as there are three distinct 
persons, God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, so each person has also its essence 
distinct and separate from the other persons; yet that all three are either as 
otherwise three men, distinct and separate in their essence, of the same power, 
The Lutheran Confessions
608
wisdom, majesty, and glory [as some imagine], or in essence and properties unequal 
[as others think].
38] 2. That the Father alone is true God.
39] These and like articles, one and all, with what pertains to them and follows 
from them, we reject and condemn as wrong, false, heretical, and contrary to 
the Word of God, the three Creeds, the Augsburg, Confession and Apology, the 
Smalcald Articles, and the Catechisms of Luther. Of these articles all godly Chris-
tians should and ought to beware, as much as the welfare and salvation of their 
souls is dear to them.
40] Since now, in the sight of God and of all Christendom [the entire Church of 
Christ], we wish to testify to those now living and those who shall come after us 
that this declaration herewith presented concerning all the controverted articles 
aforementioned and explained, and no other, is our faith, doctrine, and confession, 
in which we are also willing, by God’s grace, to appear with intrepid hearts before 
the judgment-seat of Jesus Christ, and give an account of it; and that we will nei-
ther privately nor publicly speak or write anything contrary to it, but, by the help 
of God’s grace, intend to abide thereby: therefore, after mature deliberation, we 
have, in God’s fear and with the invocation of His name, attached our signatures 
with our own hands.
The Catalog of Testimonies
609
Introduction
The Catalog of Testimonies was an appendix to the Book of Concord, included 
with most printings of the German edition in 1580. Though not a formal part of 
the Lutheran Confessions, per se, the Catalog of Testimonies was widely used and 
provides additional documentation and evidence for the Lutheran position on 
the doctrine of the two natures in Christ. This became particularly important in 
Lutheranism’s debates with Calvinism over the possibility of the actual presence 
of the body and blood of Christ under the bread and wine of the Lord’s Supper. 
Scripture passages and quotations from church fathers on the person of Christ are 
cited, with a special focus on the fact that because of the Incarnation the human 
nature of Christ shares in the qualities of divinity.
The Catalog of Testimonies

Chemnitz (1522–1586)
To the Christian Reader
1] Since, especially in the article of the Person of Christ, some have without reason 
asserted that in the Book of Concord there is a deviation from phrasibus and 
modis loquendi, that is, the phrases and modes of speech of [received and approved 
by] the ancient pure Church and fathers, and that, on the contrary, new, strange, 
self-devised, unusual and unheard-of expressions are introduced; and since the 
testimonies of the ancient Church and fathers to which this book appeals proved 
somewhat too extended to be incorporated in it, and having been carefully excerpt-
ed, were afterwards delivered to several electors and princes, –
2] [Therefore] they are printed in goodly number as an appendix at the end of this 
book, in regard to particular points, for the purpose of furnishing a correct and 
thorough account to the Christian reader, whereby he may perceive and readily 
discover that in the aforesaid book nothing new has been introduced either in 
rebus (matter) or in phrasibus (expressions), that is, neither as regards the doctrine 
nor the manner of teaching it, but that we have taught and spoken concerning this 
The Lutheran Confessions
610
mystery just as, first of all, the Holy Scriptures and afterwards the ancient pure 
Church have done.
3] Thus, in the first place, concerning the unity of the person and the distinction 
of the two natures in Christ, and their essential properties, the Book of Concord 
writes just as the ancient pure Church, its fathers and councils, have spoken – 
namely, that there are not two persons, but one Christ, and in this person two 
distinct natures, the divine and the human nature, which are not separated nor 
intermingled or transformed the one into the other, but each nature has and 
retains its essential attributes, and in [all] eternity does not lay them aside; and 
that the essential attributes of the one nature, which are truly and properly 
ascribed to the entire person, never become attributes of the other natures. This is 
borne out by the following testimonies of the ancient pure councils:
4] In the fourth canon, or rule, of the Council of Ephesus occurs the following 
resolution: “If any one divides the words of Scripture regarding Christ in two 
persons or subsistences, and applies some of them indeed to Him as man, who is 
to be understood specially, outside of the Word of God [outside of or without the 
Word of the Father, or without the Son of God], and assigns others, as worthy of 
God alone, to the Word of God the Father [some, however, only to the Son of God, 
as belonging to God alone], let him be accursed.”
5] In the fifth canon, thus: “If any one dares to say that the man Christ is the Bearer 
of God, and not rather that He is God, so as to call Him truly the Son by nature 
[that as the natural Son of God He is truly God], because it was the Word that 
was made flesh, and, in a similar manner [even] as we, became sharers of flesh and 
blood, let him be accursed.”
6] In the sixth canon, thus: “If any one does not confess the same Christ to be at the 
same time God and man [that the one Christ is at the same time God and man], 
for the reason that according to the Scriptures the Word was made flesh, let him be 
accursed.”
7] In the twelfth canon, thus: “If any one does not confess that the Word of God 
[the Father] suffered in the flesh, and was crucified in the flesh, and tasted death in 
the flesh, and became the First-born from the dead, according as [since] He is, as 
God, the Life and He that maketh alive, let him be accursed.”
8] And the decree of the Council of Chalcedon, as cited by Evagrius, lib. 2, cap 4, 
reads thus: “Following, then, the holy fathers, we confess one and the same Son, our 
Lord Jesus Christ, and we all set forth with one voice that the same is perfect in 
The Catalog of Testimonies
611
deity and the same perfect in humanity; that the same is truly God and truly man, 
consisting of a rational soul and a body; that He is consubstantial with the Father 
as regards the deity, and that the same is consubstantial with us according to the 
humanity; that He is in all respects like us, excepting sin; that He was begotten 
before the world out of the Father according to the deity, but that the same person 
was in the last days born for us and for our salvation of Mary, the virgin and moth-
er of God, according to the humanity; that one and the same Jesus Christ, the Son, 
the Lord, the Only-begotten, is known in two natures, without being commingled, 
without being changed, without being taken apart [or divided], without being 
segregated, the difference of the natures being in no wise abolished on account 
of the [personal] union, but the peculiarity of each nature being rather preserved, 
and running together into one person and subsistence; not as divided or torn into 
two persons, but one and the same only-begotten Son, God the Word and the 
Lord Jesus Christ [we acknowledge one single Christ our Lord, who is at once the 
only-begotten Son, or the Word of the Father, and also true man]; as the prophets 
of old and the Christ Himself have taught us concerning Him, and the symbol of 
the fathers has handed down to us.”
9] Thus, too, the Tenth Synodical Epistle of Leo (to Flavianus, cap. 3, fol. 92) [which 
the Council of Chalcedon regarded as equal to an instruction] says: “[The personal 
union has taken place in this manner, that] The peculiarity of each nature being 
unimpaired [remaining unmingled and unchanged], and coming together into one 
person, there has been assumed by [divine] Majesty [human] lowliness, by [divine] 
Power [human] weakness, by Eternity [the eternal divine Being] mortality [the 
human, mortal nature] (abstract for the concrete), and for the purpose of paying 
the debt of our condition, the [immortal] nature that cannot suffer has been united 
to the [human] nature that can suffer, so that our one and the same Mediator could 
both die according to one and could not die according to the other [in order that 
our single Mediator, since according to the one nature, namely, the divine, He 
could not die, might die for us according to the other, namely, the human].”
10] Likewise (cap. 4, fol. 93): “He who is true God, the same is true man, since 
both the humility of man and the loftiness of God are reciprocal [exist together 
in one person]. For just as God does not change by pity [when from pity for us He 
assumes the human nature], so man is not consumed by divine dignity [and glory]; 
for each form [nature] does what is peculiar to it, in communion with the other – 
namely, the Word working what belongs to the Word [Son of God], and the flesh 
executing what belongs to the flesh. One of these flashes forth in the miracles, 
the other sinks beneath injuries [and still there is one single Mediator, God and 
man]. He is God, because [through this, for this, and because of this, that] in the 
beginning was the Word, and God was the Word, by whom all things were made. 
The Lutheran Confessions

He is man, because [through this, for this, and because of this, that] the Word was 
made flesh, and because He was made of a woman. Also, because of [to indicate] 
this unity of the person which is to be understood in both natures, we read that 
the Son of Man descended from heaven when the Son of God assumed flesh of the 
Virgin Mary.”
11] And again (cap. 5, fol 93): “The Son of God is said to have been crucified and 
buried, although He suffered these things not in His very divinity, by which He 
is consubstantial with the Father, but in the infirmity of [His assumed] human 
nature.”
12] So far the words of the two councils, of Ephesus and of Chalcedon, with which 
also all the other holy fathers agree.
13] This is precisely what the learned men in our schools have thus far desired to 
indicate and declare by the words abstract and concrete, to which this book [of 
Concord in the present instance] also has reference in a few words (see above p. 
1029) [when it is stated]: All of which the learned know well; which words must 
necessarily be retained in their true sense in the schools.
14] For concrete terms are words of such a kind as designate the entire person in 
Christ, such as God, man. But abstract terms are words by which the natures in the 
person of Christ are understood and expressed, as divinity, humanity.
15] According to this distinction it is correctly said in concreto: God is man, man 
is God. On the other hand, it is speaking incorrectly when one says in abstracto: 
Divinity is humanity, humanity is divinity.
16] The same rule applies also to the essential attributes, so that the attributes of 
the one nature cannot be predicated of the other nature in abstracto, as though 
they were attributes also of the other nature. Therefore the following expressions 
are [would be] false and incorrect if one were to say: “The human nature is Omnip-
otence, is from eternity.” Just as the attributes themselves cannot be predicated of 
one another, as if one would say: Mortalitas est immortalitas, et e contra; “Mor-
tality is immortality,” and immortality is mortality; for by such expressions the 
distinction of the natures and their attributes is abolished, they are confounded 
with one another, changed one into the other, and thus made equal and alike.
17] But since we must not only know and firmly believe that the assumed human 
nature in the person of Christ has and retains to all eternity its essence and the 
natural essential attributes of the same, but it is a matter of especial importance,

and the greatest consolation for Christians is comprised therein, that we also 
know from the revelation of the Holy Scriptures, and without doubt believe the 
majesty to which this His human nature has been elevated in deed and truth by 
the personal union, and of which it thus has become personally participant, as has 
been extensively explained in the Book of Concord; accordingly, and in order that 
likewise every one may see that also in this part the book mentioned has intro-
duced no new, strange, self-devised, unheard-of paradoxes and expressions into the 
Church of God, the following Catalog of Testimonies – first of all from the Holy 
Scriptures, and then also of the ancient, pure teachers of the Church, especially, 
however, of those fathers who were most eminent and leaders in the first four Ec-
umenical Councils – will clearly show, from which it may be understood how they 
have spoken concerning this subject.
18] And in order that the Christian reader may the more readily find his way 
through them and get his bearing, they have been arranged under several distinct 
heads as follows: 19] First, that the Holy Scriptures, as also the fathers, when they 
speak of the majesty which the human nature of Christ has received through the 
personal union, employ the words, communicatio, communio, participatio, donatio, 
traditio, subiectio, exaltatio, dari, etc., that is, of the words “communication,” “com-
munion,” “sharing,” “bestowed and given,” etc.
20] Dan. 7:13: Behold, one like the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, and 
came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought Him near before Him; and there 
was given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and 
languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall 
not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
21] John 13:3: Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into His hand.
22] Matt. 11:27: All things are delivered unto Me of My Father.
23] Matt. 28:18: All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.
24] Phil. 2:9: God hath given Him a name which is above every name, that at the 
name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and 
things under the earth.
25] [Phil. 2:9: Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him.]

2:8.

27] EUSEBIUS (Demonstr. Evang., 1. 4, c. 13, p. 169, ed. Paris, 1628): The Word, 
however, communicates what is of His own to man, but does not receive, in turn, 
that which is from the mortal; and He imparts the divine power to the mortal, 
but is not led, in turn, into a participation of the mortal [the Word of the Father 
has of Himself communicated what was His to the assumed man; for He has 
communicated the divine power to the assumed mortal nature, but has not, in 
turn, assumed for Himself anything out of the mortal nature].
28] Again: He there makes this very One (man) worthy of the eternal life which is 
with Him, and of the communion in Deity and blessedness [that is, the Word has 
made the assumed man (concrete for the abstract) worthy of communion in the 
Deity, of eternal life and blessedness].
29] ATHANASIUS, in a letter to Epictetus (tom. 1, op. p. 589, ed. Colon.), quoted 
also by Epiphanius against the Dimoeritae (Haeres., 77; Contra Dimoeritas, t. 2, 
op. p. 1005, ed. Colon.): “Not in order to add to divinity did the Word become 
flesh, but in order that the flesh might rise up; not that the Word might be made 
better, He came forth from Mary; for rather was there a great addition to the 
human (body) from the communion and union with it of the Word.” [That is: For 
the Word did not become flesh in order that thereby something might be added to 
the divinity, nor that the Word should be brought into a better state, but from the 
communion and union of the Word with the human nature there has rather been 
added something greater to the human nature.]
30] EPIPHANIUS, in Haeresi, 69, (against the Ariomanites), p. 344 (p. 805, ed. 
Colon.): “It is manifest that the flesh which was of Mary and came of our race was 
also transformed into glory (in the transfiguration), having acquired, in addition, 
the glory of the God-head, heavenly honor and perfection and glory, which the 
flesh did not have from the beginning, but received there in the union with God 
the Word.”
31] CYRIL, in lib. 5, Dialog. (t. 5, p. 562, ed. Paris, 1638): “How, then, does the flesh 
of Christ quicken?” And he replies: “According to [On account of] the union with 
the living Word, which is accustomed to communicate the endowments of His 
nature to His own body.”
32] THEODORET, Eph. 1 (t. 3, p. 297, ed. Paris, 1642): “However, that the nature 
assumed from us is participant of the same honor with Him who assumed it, so 
that no difference in worship appears, but the divinity which is not seen is wor-
shiped through the nature which is seen, – this surpasses every miracle.”

33] DAMASCENUS, in Book 3, Of the Orthodox Faith, chaps. 7,15: “And this [the 
divine nature] [communicates or] imparts of its own excellences to the flesh, itself 
remaining impassible, and not sharing in the passions [sufferings] of the flesh.
34] Also, chap. 19: The Flesh has communion with the operating divinity of the 
Word, because the divine operations are executed as through the organ of the body, 
and because He that works both in a divine and human fashion is one. For it is 
necessary to know that just as His holy mind performs also His natural operations, 
etc., it participates in the divinity of the Word, that works and arranges and 
governs, perceiving and knowing and determining everything [the entire universe], 
not as the mere mind of man, but as being made one in person with God, and as 
being constituted the mind of God.
35] That Christ has received this majesty in time, moreover, not according to the 
divinity, or the divine nature, but according to His assumed nature, or according 
to the flesh, as man, or as the Son of Man, humanitus, ratione corporis seu 
humanitatis, propter carnem, quia homo aut filius hominis [humanly, with respect 
to His body or humanity, on account of the flesh, because He is man or the Son of 
Man]:
36] Heb. 1:3: When He had by Himself purged our sins, [He] sat down on the right 
hand of the Majesty on high.
37] Heb. 2:8-9: But know we see not yet all thing put under Him. But we see Jesus, 
who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned 
with glory and honor.
38] Luke 22:69: Hereafter shall the Son of Man sit on the right hand of the power 
of God.
39] Luke 1:32-33: The Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David; 
and He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there shall 
be no end.
40] John 5:26-27: He hath given to the Son to have life in Himself, and hath given 
Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man.
41] ATHANASIUS, quoted by Theodoret, Dialog 2, p. 330: “Now, whatever Scrip-
ture says that the Word received [in time], and as to whatever He was glorified, it 
says on account of His humanity, and not on account of His divinity.”
The Lutheran Confessions
616
42] ATHANASIUS, in the Oration against the Arians, 2 and 4 (f. 347. 490 f. 492, 
ed. Colon., 1686): “Scripture does not mean that the substance of the Word has 
been exalted, but this refers to His humanity, and He is said to be exalted on 
account of the flesh. For since it is His body, He Himself is properly said as man 
to be exalted and to receive something with respect to His body, according to 
humanity, because the body receives those things which the Word always possessed 
according to His own deity and perfection from the Father. He says, therefore, that 
as a man He received the power, which as God He always has. And He who glori-
fies others says, ‘Glorify Me,’ in order to show that He had a flesh that lacked such 
things. And, therefore, when the flesh of His humanity receives this glorification, 
He so speaks as though He Himself had received it.
43] For we must bear in mind everywhere [in the Holy Scriptures] that none of 
those things which He says that He received, namely, in time, He received in such 
a way as though He had not had them; for, being God and the Word, naturally 
He had those things always. But now He says that He received them according to 
humanity, so that, His flesh in Himself receiving them, He might in future hand 
them over from out of His flesh to us to be firmly possessed.”
44] The same, On the Assumed Humanity, against Apollinarius (pp. 603 and 611, 
ed. Colon., 1686): “When Peter says that Jesus was made of God Lord and Christ, 
He speaks not of His divinity, but of His humanity. His Word always was Lord, nei-
ther did He become Lord first after the cross, but His divinity made the humanity 
Lord and Christ.”
45] Also: “Whatever Scripture says that the Son has received, it understands as 
having been received with respect to His body, and that body is the first-fruits of 
the Church. Accordingly, God raised up and exalted His own body first, but after-
wards the members of His body.” By these words Athanasius explained what a little 
afterwards he applied in its way also to the entire Church.
46] BASIL THE GREAT, Against Eunomius, lib. 4 (p. 769, ed. Paris): “That the 
Lord is celebrated, and receives a name above every name; also [that he says]: ‘All 
power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth; I live for the sake of the Father; 
Glorify Thou Me with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was,’ etc., 
– must be understood of the incarnation, and not of the Deity.”
47] AMBROSE, lib. 5 De Fide, cap. 6 (tom. 2, p. 109): “You have learned that He 
can subject all things to Himself undoubtedly according to the operation of Deity. 
Learn now that He receives, according to His flesh, all things as subjected to Him,

as it is written, Eph. 1: According to the flesh, therefore, all things are delivered to 
Him as subject.”
48] The same, lib. 5, cap. 2 (p.99): “For God does not give to the apostles participa-
tion in His seat, but to Christ, according to His humanity, is given participation in 
the divine seat.”
49] And cap. 6 (p. 108): “In Christ our common [human] nature, according to the 
flesh, has obtained the prerogative of the heavenly seat.”
50] CHRYSOSTOM, Heb, 1, Serm. 3, p. 117 (tom. 4; Homilies, 3, p. 1493): “[The 
Father has commanded] Saying with respect to the flesh, And let all the angels of 
God worship Him.”
51] THEOPHYLACT, on John 3 (p. 235; ed. Paris, 1631, f. 605): “And He gave all 
things into the hand of the Son, according to humanity.”
52] OECUMENIUS, from Chrysostom, Heb. 1 (t. 2, op. p. 324, ed 1631): “For as the 
Son is God, He has an eternal throne. ‘Thy throne,’ says God, ‘is forever and ever.’ 
For after the cross and passion He was deemed worthy of this honor not as God, 
but as man He received what He had as God.” And a little after: “As man He there-
fore hears, ‘Sit on My right hand.’ For as God He has eternal power.”
53] CYRIL, lib. 9 Thesauri, cap. 3 (tom. 2, p. 110): “As man He ascended to the 
power of ruling.”
54] The same, lib. 2, cap. 17: “As man He sought His glory which He always had as 
God. Neither are these things said by Him as though He had ever been destitute 
of His own glory, but because He wished to bring His own temple into the glory 
which He always has as God.”
55] The same, lib. 2, Ad Reginas: “That He received glory, power, and rule over all 
things must be referred to the conditions [properties] of humanity.”
56] THEODORET, on Ps. 2 (t. 1, p. 242): “Though Christ as God is Lord by nature, 
He receives universal power also as man.”
57] On Ps. 110 (t. 1, p. 242): “ ‘Sit Thou at My right hand,’ – this was said according 
to the human nature. For as God He has eternal dominion, so as man He has re-
ceived what He had as God. As man, therefore, He hears [what is said to Him], ‘Sit 
at My right hand.’ For as God He has eternal dominion.”
The Lutheran Confessions
618
58] The same, on Heb. 1 (t. 2, p. 154): “Christ always received from the angels wor-
ship and adoration, for He always was God. But now they are adoring Him also as 
man.”
59] LEO, Epist. 23 (fol. 99; Ep. [ 23 and 83 ] 46 and 97, ff. 261 and 317, ed. Lugd., 
1700), treating of Eph 1, says: “Let the adversaries of the truth declare when or 
according to what nature the almighty Father raised His Son above all things, or to 
what substance [nature] He subjected to all things. For to the Deity, as to the Cre-
ator, all things have always been subject. If power was added to Him, if Sublimity 
was exalted, it was inferior to Him who exalted, and did not have the riches of that 
nature of whose liberality it stood in need. But a person holding such views Arius 
receives into his fellowship.”
60] The same, Epist. 83 (fol. 134): “Although in Christ there is absolutely one and 
the same person of the divinity and the humanity, nevertheless we understand that 
exaltation and the name above every name pertain to that form which was to be 
enriched by the increase of so great a glorification. For by incarnation nothing had 
been withdrawn from the Word which would be returned to it by the gift of the 
Father. But the form of a servant is human humility, which has been exalted to the 
glory of divine power, so that divine things were not to be done without the man, 
nor human things without God.”
61] In the same place: “Whatever Christ has received in time He has received as 
man, upon whom are conferred those things which He did not have. For, according 
to the power of the Word, the Son also has all things that the Father has, without a 
difference.”
62] VIGILIUS, lib. 5, Against Eutyches (Ep. 66 sq., ed. Divion., 1664.4): “by ad-
vancements of dignity, to receive the power of heaven and earth by the merit of 
obedience. Therefore, according to the nature of the flesh He acquired these things 
who according to the nature of the Word never lacked any of them. For had the 
Creator no power and dominion over His creature, that in the last times He should 
obtain them as a gift?”
63] NICEPHORUS, lib. 1, cap. 36 (fol. 86): “Christ is seen by His disciples on the 
mountain in Galilee, and there He affirms that the highest power of heaven and 
earth has been delivered to Him, namely, according to humanity.”
64] That, first of all, the Holy Scriptures, and then also the holy fathers of the 
ancient pure Church, speak concerning this mystery also per vocabula abstracta, 
that is, in such words as expressly indicate the human nature in Christ, and refer to

the same in the personal union, namely, that the human nature actually and truly 
has received and uses such majesty:
65] John 6:54-55: Whoso eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood hath eternal life… 
For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed.
66] 1 John 1:7: The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son cleanseth us from all sin.
67] Heb. 9:14: The blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself 
without spot to God, purges your conscience from dead works to serve the living 
God.
68] Matt. 26:26-28: Take eat; this is My body… Drink ye all of it; for this is My 
blood of the new testament.
69] EUSTACHIUS, quoted by Theodoret, Dialog 2 (p. 40): “Therefore he prophe-
sied that He [Christ the man, the human nature of Christ] would sit upon a holy 
throne, signifying that He has made Himself known as sharing the throne with the 
most Divine Spirit, on account of God’s dwelling inseparably in Him.’
70] The same, quoted in Gelasius: “The man Christ, who increased in wisdom, age, 
and favor, received the dominion of all things.”
71] the same, in the same place: “Christ, in His very body, came to His apostles, 
saying: ‘All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth’; which power the exter-
nal temple received, and not God, [namely, according to His divinity], who built 
that temple [of His body] of extraordinary beauty.”
72] ATHANASIUS, On the Arian and Catholic Confession (t. 2, op. p. 579, ed. 
Colon.): “God was not changed into human flesh or substance, but in Himself glo-
rified the nature which He assumed, so that the human, weak, and mortal flesh and 
nature advanced to [obtained] divine glory, so as to have all power in heaven and in 
earth, which it did not have before it was assumed by the Word.”
73] The same (l. c., pp. 597 and 603), On the Assumed Humanity, against 
Apollinarius (p. 530): Paul, Phil. 2, speaks of a [His] temple which is His body. For 
not He who is the Highest, but the flesh, is exalted; and to his flesh He gave a name 
which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, and 
every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord, to the glory of the Father. And 
he adds a general rule: When Scripture speaks of the glorification of Christ, it 
speaks of the flesh, which has received glory. And whatever Scripture says that the 
The Lutheran Confessions
620
Son has received, it declares with respect to His humanity, and not to His divinity; 
as, when the apostle says that in Christ dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead 
bodily, we must understand that this fullness dwells in the flesh of Christ.
74] The same, quoted by Theodoret, Dialog 2 (t. 3, p. 286): 
“ ‘Sit on My right hand,’ has been said to the Lord’s body.” Also: “It is therefore the 
body to which He says, ‘Sit on My right hand.’ ”
75] ATHANASIUS, On the Incarnation, as quoted in Cyril in his Defense of the 
8th Anathema, and in his book, On the True Faith to the Queens: “If any one says 
that the flesh of our Lord as that of a man is inadorable, and is not to be worshiped 
as the flesh of the Lord and God, him the Holy Catholic Church anathematizes.”
76] The same, On Humanity Assumed (p. 603, ed. Colon.): “Whatever Scripture 
says that the Son has received, it understands as having been received with respect 
to His body, and that this body is the first-fruits of the Church. The Lord therefore 
first raised and exalted His body, but afterward also the members of His body.”
77] HILARY, lib. 9 (p. 136): “That thus the man Jesus remained in the glory of God 
the Father, if the flesh had been united to the glory of the Word, and the assumed 
flesh possessed the glory of the Word.” (Concrete for abstract.)
78] EUSEBIUS OF EMISSA, in his homily of the Sixth Holiday after Easter (Feria 
6, paschatos in homiliis 5, patrum, p. 297): “He who, according to His divinity, 
had always, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, power over all things, now 
also according to His humanity has received power over all things, so that this 
man who suffered not long ago rules over heaven and earth, yea, does here and 
there whatever He wishes.”79] GREGORY OF NYSSA, quoted by Gelasius and 
Theodoret, Dialog 2 (t. 2., p. 333): “ ‘Therefore, being exalted to the right hand of 
God’ [ Acts 2:33 ]. Who, then, was exalted? The lowly one or the Highest? But what 
is lowly if not the human? What else besides the divine is the Highest? But God, 
being the Highest, does not need to be exalted. Therefore, the apostle says that the 
human [nature] was exalted, and that it was exalted by becoming Lord and Christ. 
Therefore, by the words He has made the apostle does not express the premundane 
[eternal] subsistence of the Lord, but the advancement of that which is low to the 
Highest, namely, to the right hand of God.”
80] And shortly afterwards: “Because the right hand of God, the Creator of all 
things that exist, which is the Lord, by whom all things were made, and without 
The Catalog of Testimonies
621
whom nothing of those things that were made subsist, has itself, through the 
union, raised up to its own height the man who has been united with it.”
81] BASIL THE GREAT, Against Eunomius, lib. 2, p. 661): “[When Peter, Acts 
2, says:] ‘God hath evidently made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both 
Lord and Christ,’ by the demonstrative word [that same] he applies himself almost 
entirely to His human nature, seen by all.” Shortly afterwards: “So that in saying, 
‘God hath made Him both Lord and Christ,’ he says that power and dominion over 
all things were entrusted to Him [to the humanity] by the Father.”
82] EPIPHANIUS, Against the Ariomanites (p. 327, t. 1; fol. 728, ed. Paris, 1638): 
“[Peter, by adding:] ‘This same Jesus whom ye crucified’ [indicates the incarnation 
of the Lord, and it is manifest that he is speaking of the flesh], in order that the 
holy incarnate dispensation might not be left by the impassible and uncreated 
Word, but might be united above to the uncreated Word. On this account God 
made that which was conceived of Mary and united to Deity both Lord and 
Christ.”
83] AMBROSE, lib. 3, cap. 12, Of the Holy Ghost (t. 2, p. 157 [fol. 765, ed. Colon.]): 
“The angels adore not only the divinity of Christ, but also His footstool.” And af-
terwards: “The prophet says that the earth which the Lord Jesus took upon Himself 
in the assumption of the flesh is to be adored. Therefore by footstool the earth is 
understood, but by earth the flesh of Christ, which we to-day also adore in the 
mysteries, and which the apostles adored in the Lord Jesus, as we have said above.”
84] AUGUSTINE, Of the Words of the Lord, Discourse 58 (t. 10, p. 217): “If Christ 
is not God by nature, but a creature, He is neither to be worshiped nor adored as 
God. But to these things they will reply and say: Why, then, is it that you adore 
with His divinity His flesh, which you do not deny to be a creature, and are no less 
devoted to it than to Deity?”
85] The same, on Ps. 99:5 (t. 8, p. 1103): 
“ ‘Worship His footstool.’ His footstool is the earth, and Christ took upon Him 
earth of earth, because flesh is of earth; and He received flesh of the flesh of Mary. 
And because He walked here in this very flesh, he also gave this very flesh to be 
eaten by us for salvation. But no one eats that flesh unless He has first worshiped 
it. Therefore the way has been found how such footstool of the Lord may be wor-
shiped, so that we not only do not sin by worshiping, but sin by not worshiping.”
The Lutheran Confessions
622
86] CHRYSOSTOM, on Heb. 2 (p. 125): “For it is really great and wonderful and 
full of awe that our flesh should be seated above, and be worshiped by angels and 
archangels and by the seraphim and cherubim. Reflecting upon this, I am often 
entranced [seem to be beside myself].”
87] The same on I Cor. 10 (p. 174, t. 6, p. 740, and t. 5, p. 261, ed. Frankf.): “This 
body, even when lying in the manger, the Magi worshiped, etc.; and they took a 
long journey; and having come, they worshiped with much fear and trembling.”
88] The same, in Epist. 65 to Leo: “Let us learn to know which nature it is to which 
the Father said, Share My seat. It is that nature to which it has been said, ‘Dust 
thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.’ ”
89] THEOPHYLACT, from Chrysostom, on chap 28 of Matt. (p. 311 [ed. Lutet., 
8, 1631, fols. 184. 605]): “Since the human nature, but recently condemned, united 
in person with God the Word, is seated in heaven, worshiped by angels, He says 
properly: ‘All power is given unto Me in heaven.’ For also the human nature, which 
but recently served, now in Christ rules over all things.”
90] The same, on chap. 3 of John: “He has also given all things into the hand of the 
Son, according to His humanity.”
91] CYRIL, On the Incarnation, cap. 11 (t. 4, p. 241; t. 5, p. 695): “The Word intro-
duced Himself into that which He was not, in order that the nature of man also 
might become what it was not, resplendent, by its union, with the grandeur of 
divine majesty, which has been raised beyond nature rather than that it has cast the 
unchangeable God beneath [its] nature.”
92] Council of Ephesus (Cyril, t. 4, p. 140 [Apologet, adv. Orient., t. 6, fol. 196]), in 
Canon 11: “If any one does not confess that the flesh of the Lord is quickening, be-
cause it was made the Word’s own, who quickens all things, let him be anathema.”
93] Cyril also (ibid., p. 140; t. 4, p. 85), in his explanation of this anathematization, 
says that Nestorius was unwilling to ascribe quickening to the flesh of Christ, but 
explained the passages in John 6 as referring to the divinity alone.”
94] THEODORET, Dialog 2: “And it (the body of the Lord) was deemed worthy 
of the seat of the right hand, and is worshiped by every creature, as it is called the

95] The same, on Ps. 8: “Such honor, namely, dominion over the universe, the hu-
man nature in Christ has received of God.”
96] LEO (fol. 94 [Ep. 25, fol. 246]), Epist. 11: “It is a promotion of that which is as-
sumed [man], and not of Him who assumes [God], that God has exalted Him, and 
given Him a name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee 
should bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God 
the Father.”
97] DAMASCENUS, lib. 3, cap. 18 (p. 251): “Therefore His [Christ’s] divine will was 
both eternal and omnipotent, etc. But His human will not only began in time, but 
also endured natural and unblamable affections, and indeed was not omnipotent 
by nature; but as it has truly and by nature become the will of God the Word, it is 
also omnipotent.” This means, as explained by a commentator: “The divine will has, 
by its own nature, the power to do all things which it wishes; but Christ’s human 
will does not have power to do everything by its nature, but as united to God the 
Word.”
98] The same, cap. 19: “The flesh has communion with the operating divinity of the 
Word, because the divine operations are accomplished as through the organ of the 
body, and because He that works both in a divine and human fashion is one. For 
it is necessary to know that His holy mind works also its natural operations, etc., 
shares in the working and managing and guiding divinity of the Word, understand-
ing and knowing and managing everything [the entire universe], not as the mere 
mind of a man, but as personally united with God and being constituted the mind 
of God.”
99] The same, in the same book, cap. 21: “The human nature does not essentially 
possess knowledge of the future; but the soul of the Lord, on account of the union 
with the Word Himself and the personal identity, was, apart from the other divine 
criteria, rich also in knowledge of the future.”
100] At the end of the chapter: “We say that this Master and Lord of all creation, 
the one Christ, who is at the same time God and man, knows also all things. For in 
Him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”
101] NICEPHORUS, lib. 18, cap. 36: “Christ is seen by His disciples on the moun-
tain in Galilee, and there asserts that the highest power in heaven and in earth has, 
by the Father, been delivered Him, namely, according to His human nature.”

102] That the Holy Scriptures and the fathers have understood this majesty which 
Christ has received in time not only of created gifts de finitis qualitatibus, but of 
the glory and majesty of divinity belonging to God, to which His human nature, 
in the person of the Son of God, has been exalted, and thus has received the power 
and efficacy of the divine nature which are peculiar to the Deity.
103] John 17:5: And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine Own Self, with the 
glory which I had with Thee before the world was.
104] Col. 2:9: In Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
105] HILARY, On the Trinity, lib. 3 (p. 28): “The Word made flesh prayed that 
that which was from time [had a beginning in time] might receive the glory of that 
brightness which is without time.”
106] GREGORY OF NYSSA, quoted by Gelasius and Theodoret, Dialog 2, 
concerning the saying of Peter, Acts 2: “Being exalted by the right hand of God,” 
etc. (t. 2, p. 333 [al. 330]): “This (right hand of God), through the union, raised to its 
own height the Man united to it.”
107] The same, Concerning the Soul: “God the Word is never altered by the 
communion which He has with the body and soul, neither is He partaker of their 
imperfection, but, transmitting to them the power of His divinity, He remains the 
same that He was even before the union.”
108] BASIL THE GREAT, On the Holy Nativity of Christ (p. 231): “In what man-
ner is the Deity in the flesh? Just as fire in iron, not by transition, but by imparta-
tion. For fire does not run out to the iron, but, remaining in its place, imparts to it 
its own peculiar power, which is not diminished by the impartation, and fills the 
entire mass that becomes partaker of it.”
109] EPIPHANIUS, in Ancoratus (fol. 504 [fol. 86, ed. Colon.]): “Strengthening an 
earthly body with divinity, He united it unto one power, brought it into one divin-
ity, being one Lord, one Christ – not two Christs, nor two Gods,” etc.
110] CYRIL, on John, lib. 4, cap. 23: “You are not altogether unwise in denying 
that the flesh is quickening. For if it alone be understood, it can quicken nothing 
whatever, being itself in need of a quickener. But when you have examined the mys-
tery of the incarnation with commendable care, and have learned to know the life 
dwelling in the flesh, you will believe that, although the flesh is not able to do any-
thing by itself, it has nevertheless become quickening. For since it has been united 
The Catalog of Testimonies
625
to the quickening Word, it has entirely been rendered quickening. For it [the flesh 
of Christ] has not dragged down to its corruptible nature the Word of God which 
has been joined to it, but has itself been elevated to the power of the better nature. 
Although, therefore, the nature of the flesh, inasmuch as it is flesh, cannot quicken, 
nevertheless it does this because it has received the entire operation of the Word. 
For the body not of Paul or of Peter or of others, but that of Life itself in which 
the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, can do this. Therefore, the flesh of all 
the others can do nothing, but only the flesh of Christ can quicken, because in it 
dwells the only-begotten Son of God.”
111] AUGUSTINE, Against Felicianus the Arian, cap. 11: “I do not acknowledge 
that Deity experienced the violence done His body in the same manner as we know 
that the flesh was glorified by the majesty of Deity.”
112] THEODORET, cap. Of Antichrist (t. 2, p. 411): “The Word that became man 
did not confer a partial grace upon the assumed nature, but it pleased [God] that 
the whole fullness of Deity dwell in it.”
113] The same, on Ps. 21, t. 1, p. 110: “If the assumed nature has been joined with the 
divinity which assumed it, it has also become participant and associate of the same 
glory and honor.”
114] The same, on Heb. 1: “The human nature itself, after the resurrection, attained 
divine glory.”
115] DAMASCENUS, lib. 3, capp. 7. 15: “And this (the divine nature) imparts to 
the flesh its own excellences, itself [according to its nature] remaining impassible 
and not participating in the passions [sufferings] of the flesh.”
116] That Christ as God has the same divine majesty in one way, namely, essentially 
and as His essential property, in and of Himself; but as man He has it in another 
mode, namely, not essentially in and of Himself, but because of, and according to, 
the mode of the personal union.
117] John 14:6: I am the Life.
118] John 5:26: He hath given to the Son to have life in Himself,… because He is the 
Son of Man.
119] CYRIL, lib. 12, Thesauri, cap. 15 (t. 2, p. 167 [t. 5, ed. Paris, 1638]): “There is one 
condition and property appertaining to the creature and another to the Creator,

626
but our nature, assumed by the Son of God, has exceeded its measure, and by grace 
has been transferred into the condition of the One assuming it.”
120] The same, on John, lib. 2, cap. 144 (t. 1, p. 134 [t. 4, ed. Paris, 1638]): “Christ 
added the reason why He said that life and the power of judgment had been given 
Him by the Father, saying, Because He is the Son of Man, in order that we may un-
derstand that all things were given Him as man. However, the only-begotten Son is 
not partaker of life, but is life by nature.”
121] The same, lib. 3, cap. 37 (t. 1, p. 181): “The body of Christ quickens, because it 
is the body of Life itself, retaining the power of the incarnate Word, and full of the 
power of Him by whom all things are and live.”
122] The same, lib. 4, cap 14 (p. 201): “Since the flesh of the Savior was joined to the 
Word of God, who is Life by nature, it was rendered quickening.”
123] And cap. 18 (p. 204): “My body I have filled with life, I have assumed mortal 
flesh; but since, being naturally the Life, I dwell in it [the flesh], I have transformed 
it altogether according to My life.”
124] Cap. 24 (p. 210): “The nature itself of the flesh cannot of itself quicken, neither 
is it understood to be alone in Christ, but it has united with it the Son of God, 
who is substantially the Life. Therefore, when Christ call His flesh quickening, He 
does not ascribe the power of quickening to it in the same manner as to Himself or 
His own Spirit. For the Spirit quickens of Himself, to Whose power the flesh rises 
by the union. But how this occurs we can neither understand with the mind nor 
express with the tongue, but we receive it in silence and firm faith.”
125] The same, lib. 10, cap. 13 (p.501): “The flesh of life, having been made the flesh 
of the Only-begotten, has been brought to the power of life.”
126] The same, lib. 11, cap. 21 (p. 552): “The flesh itself of Christ was not of itself 
holy, but, transformed in a certain manner by union with the Word to the power 
of the Word, it is the cause of salvation and sanctification to those who partake 
thereof. Therefore, we ascribe the efficacy of the divine working not to the flesh as 
flesh, but to the power of the Word.”
127] Lib. 6, Dialog. (t. 5, op. ed. cit.): “He is glorified by the Father, not because He 
is God, but since He was man; for, not having as the fruit of His own nature the 
power of working with divine efficacy, He received it in a certain manner by the

union and ineffable concurrence which God the Word is understood to have with 
humanity.”
128] The same, On the True Faith, to Theodosius (p. 278): “He has introduced His 
life into the assumed body by the very dispensation of the union.”
129] In the same place (p. 279): The Word quickens on account of the ineffable 
birth from the living Father. Yet we should see where the efficacy of divine glory is 
ascribed also to His own flesh.” Also: “We will confess that, with respect to the abil-
ity to quicken, earthly flesh is inoperative, so far as its own nature is concerned.”
130] EPIPHANIUS, Against the Ariomanites, p. 337 (Haeres., 69; p. 789, ed. 
Colon.): “For His human nature was not something subsisting apart by itself, nei-
ther did He speak with the divinity separated and the human nature existing apart, 
as though they were different persons, but with the human nature united with the 
divine (there being one consecration), and in the same even now knowing the most 
perfect things, it being now united in God and joined to the one Deity.”
131] AUGUSTINE, Of the Words of the Lord, Discourse 58 (t. 10, pp. 217. 218): “I 
indeed adore the Lord’s flesh, yea, the perfect humanity in Christ, for the reason 
that it has been assumed by the divinity and united to Deity, and I confess not that 
there are two different persons, but that the one and the same Son of God is God 
and man. In a word, if you separate man and God, I never believe nor serve Him.”
132] Also, “If any one disdain worshiping humanity, not naked or alone, but united 
to divinity, namely, the one Son of God, true God and true man, he will die eter-
nally.”
133] The same, De Civitate, lib. 10, cap. 24: “The flesh of Christ, therefore, does not 
of itself cleanse believers, but through the Word, by which it has been assumed.”
134] COUNCIL OF EPHESUS, Canon 11 (in Cyril, t. 6, p. 196): “If anyone does not 
confess that the Lord’s flesh is quickening, for the reason that it was appropriated 
to the Word that quickens all things, let him be anathema.”
135] THEOPHYLACT, on John 3 (pp. 605. 184, ed. cit.): “And He has given all 
things into the hand of the Son, according to humanity. But if [also] according to 
divinity, what is meant? The Father has given all things to the Son by reason of 
nature, not of grace.”
The Lutheran Confessions
628
136] The same, on Matt. 28: “If you would understand the declaration: ‘All power 
is given unto Me in heaven and in earth,’ as spoken of God the Word, the meaning 
will be that both the unwilling and willing now acknowledge Me as God, who 
before served Me after the manner of involuntary obedience. But as spoken of the 
human nature, understand it thus: I, preciously the condemned nature, but being 
God according to the unconfused union with the Son of God, have received power 
over all things.”
137] DAMASCENUS, (lib. 3, cap. 17): “For not according to its [the flesh’s] own 
operation, but by the Word united to it, He wrought divine things, the Word 
displaying through it His own operation. For glowing iron burns not by possessing 
in a natural manner the power to burn, but by possessing this from its union with 
the fire. Therefore in itself it was mortal, and on account of its personal union to 
the Word, quickening.”
138] The same (cap. 18): “His [Christ’s] divine will was both eternal and omnipo-
tent, etc. But His human will not only began in time, but also endured natural and 
unblamable affections, and naturally was not indeed omnipotent; but as truly and 
by nature it has become the will also of God the Word, it is also omnipotent.” This 
is, as explained by a commentator: “The divine will has, by its own nature, the pow-
er to do all things which it wishes; but Christ’s human will does not have power to 
do everything by its nature, but as united to God the Word.”
139] The same, in the same book, cap. 21: “The human nature does not possess 
essentially the knowledge of the future; but the soul of the Lord, on account of 
the union with the Word and the personal identity with the same, was, apart from 
other divine criteria, rich also in the knowledge of the future.”
140] And at the end of the chapter: “We say that the one Christ, Master, and Lord 
of all creation, at the same time God and man, knows also all things. For in Him 
are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”
141] The same (lib. 2, cap. 22): “For although it (the soul of the Lord) was of a 
nature that was ignorant of the future, nevertheless, being personally united to 
the Word, it had the knowledge of all things, not by grace, but on account of the 
personal union.”
142] Shortly afterwards: “And since in our Lord Jesus Christ the natures are dis-
tinct, the natural wills, that is, the powers of will, are also distinct.”

143] That now the divine nature powerfully manifests and actually exerts its 
majesty, power, and efficacy (which is and remains peculiar to the divine nature) 
in, with, and through the human nature personally united to it; which has such 
majesty because the entire fullness of the Godhead dwells personally in the 
assumed flesh and blood of Christ.
144] Rom. 3:25: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His 
blood.
145] Rom. 5:9: Being now justified by His blood.
146] Col. 1:20: Having made peace by the blood of His cross, by Him to reconcile 
all things to Himself.
147] ATHANASIUS, Oration 4, Against the Arians (Epist. ad Adelp. c. Arian, t. 
1, p. 161, ed. Colon.): “Why should the body of the Lord not be worshiped when 
the Word, by stretching out His bodily hand, healed the one sick of a fever, and by 
uttering a human voice raised Lazarus, and by extending His hands upon the cross 
overthrew the prince of the air?”
148] The same, Dialog 5, Of the Trinity (t. 2, op. f. 257): “God the Word, having 
been united to man, performs miracles, not apart from the human nature, but it 
has pleased Him to work His divine power through it and in it and with it.”
149] And shortly afterwards: “And according to His good pleasure He renders the 
humanity perfect above its own nature, and did not prevent its being a rational 
living being [creature, and a true human nature].”
150] CYRIL, De Recta Fide ad Theodosium (t. 5, op.): “The soul, having obtained 
union with the Word, descended into hell; but, using its divine power and efficacy, 
it said to the fettered ones, Go forth.”
151] The same, lib. 1, Ad Reginas: “Christ as God quickens through His own flesh.”
152] And that this communication of the divine majesty occurs also in glory, 
without mingling, annihilation, or denial of the human nature.
153] Matt. 16:27: The Son of Man shall come in the glory of His Father.
154] And Acts 1:11: He shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into 
heaven.

155] ATHANASIUS, Dialog 5, Of the Trinity (t. 2, f. 257, ed. Colon.): “And accord-
ing to His good pleasure He renders the humanity perfect above its own nature, 
and did not prevent its being a rational living being [creature, and a true human 
nature].”
156] THEOPHYLACT, from Chrysostom, on Matt. 28 (p. 184): “I, previously the 
condemned nature, being God according to the unconfused union with the Son of 
God, have received power over all things.”
157] CYRIL, lib. 4, cap. 24 (t. 4, p. 377, and 3, f. 783): “He has shown that His entire 
body is full of the quickening energy of the Spirit, not because it has lost the na-
ture of flesh and been changed into the Spirit, but because, being united with the 
Spirit, it has acquired the entire power to quicken.”
158] The same, Of the Incarnation, cap. 8: In a coal, as an illustration, we can see 
how God the Word, united indeed to humanity, has transformed the assumed na-
ture into its glory and efficacy. As fire adheres to wood, so has God been united to 
humanity in a manner that cannot be grasped, conferring upon it also the opera-
tion of His nature.”
159] THEODORET, Dialog 2 (t. 4, f. 82 and 112): “And accordingly the body of the 
Lord arose incorruptible and impassible and immortal, and glorified with divine 
glory, and is worshiped by the heavenly powers. Nevertheless, it is a body, having 
the former circumscription.”
160] The same, in Dialog 3, approves this sentence of Apollinarius: “If the mingling 
of fire with iron, which shows that iron is fire, so that it does also those things that 
belong to fire, does not change the nature of the iron, neither, therefore, is the 
union of God with the body a change of the body, although it furnishes the body 
with divine operations.”
161] DAMASCENUS, lib. 3, cap. 17: “The flesh of the Lord was enriched with 
divine operations on account of its complete personal union with the Word, in no 
way having suffered loss with respect to those things that are by nature its own.”
162] The same, lib. 2, cap. 22: “For although it (the soul of the Lord) was of a nature 
that was ignorant of the future, nevertheless, being personally united to God 
the Word, it had the knowledge of all things, not by grace, but on account of the 
personal union.” And shortly afterwards: “And since in our Lord Jesus Christ the 
natures are distinct, the natural wills, that is, the powers of will, are also distinct.”

163] Also, that, according to the nature and because of the personal union, the 
human nature is participant and capable of divine majesty which belongs to God.
164] Col. 2:9.3: In Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. In whom 
are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
165] JUSTIN, in Expositio Fidei, p. 182 [f. 389, ed. Colon., 1686]: “We do not say 
that He is in the Father as in others; not because the essence that is in others is 
contracted, but because of the limited capacity of those who receive it not being 
sufficient for the admission of God.”
166] Also: “For a defiled body does not receive rays of divinity.”
167] And shortly afterwards: “Thus consider the Sun of Righteousness in substance 
equally present to all things, inasmuch as He is God; but that we all, being weak 
and having eyes dimmed by the filth of sins, are incapable of receiving the light, yet 
that His own temple, His most pure eye, is capable of the splendor of all the light, 
as it has been formed by the Holy Ghost and is altogether separated from sin.”
168] ORIGEN, De Principiis, lib. 2, cap. 6 (t. 1, op. f. 698 and 749, ed. Basil): “The 
entire soul of Christ receives the entire Word, and passes [is received] into His light 
and splendor.”
169] Lib. 4: “The soul of Christ, united to the Word of God, has been fully capable 
of receiving the Son of God.”
170] AUGUSTINE, Ep. 57: “Although God is present entire to all creatures, and 
dwells especially in believers, nevertheless they do not entirely receive Him, but, 
according to the difference in their capacity, some possess and receive Him more, 
and others less. But of our Head, Christ, the apostle says: In Him dwelleth all the 
fullness of the Godhead bodily.”
171] Although it is known and undeniable that the Godhead, together with its 
divine majesty, is not to be locally circumscribed by the flesh, as though it were 
enclosed in a vessel, as Athanasius, Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, and others correctly 
wrote, and as also the Book of Concord [p. 1019] expressly rejects as an error the 
teaching that the humanity of Christ has been locally expanded into all places, 
or that, by the personal union, the human nature in Christ has been transformed 
into an infinite essence, – nevertheless, since the divine and human natures are 
personally and inseparably united in Christ, the Holy Scriptures and the holy 
fathers testify that wherever Christ is, there is not half His person, or only one half, 
The Lutheran Confessions
632
or only a part of His person, for instance, the divinity alone, separate and bare, 
minus and without His assumed humanity personally united thereto or separated 
from it, and outside of the personal union with the humanity; but that His entire 
person, namely, as God and man, according to the mode of the personal union with 
the humanity, which is an inscrutable mystery, is everywhere present in a way and 
measure which is known to God.
172] Eph. 4:10: He ascended up far above all heavens, that He might fill all things. 
This Oecumenius explains thus: “For, indeed, He long ago filled all things with His 
bare divinity; and having become incarnate, that He might fill all things with His 
flesh, He descended and ascended.”
173] And THEOPHYLACT, on the same passage (Comment. in Eph., p. 535, ed. 
Lond., 1636): “In order that He might fill all things with His dominion and work-
ing, and that, in the flesh, since even before He filled all things with His divinity. 
These things, however, are against Paul of Samosata and Nestorius.”
174] LEO, Epist. 10 (Ep. 24, cap. 5, p. 245, and in Serm., f. 121, ed. cit.): “The Church 
Catholic lives and advances in this faith, that in Christ Jesus there is believed 
neither the humanity without the true divinity nor the divinity without the true 
humanity.”
175] The same, in Discourse 3, On the Passion: “This the catholic faith teaches, this 
it requires, that we know that in our Redeemer two natures have united, and that, 
while their properties remained, such a union of both substances has occurred that, 
from the time in which the Word became flesh in the womb of the Blessed Virgin, 
we are not to think of God without this, that He is man; nor of the man without 
this, that He is God.”
176] In the same place: “Each nature, by distinct operations, declares its genuine-
ness, but neither separates itself from connection with the other; here nothing 
belonging to the one is lacking to the other; but God assumed the entire man, and 
so united Himself to man and man to Himself, that each nature is in the other, and 
neither passed into the other with the loss of its own attributes.”
177] But since in this article such teaching is especially directed to the end that 
we may know where we should seek and may apprehend the entire person of the 
Mediator, God and man, the Book of Concord, as also all other holy fathers, directs 
us, not to wood or stone or anything else, but to that to which Christ has pointed 
and directed us in and with His Word.

178] CYRIL, lib. 2, John, cap. 32 (t. 3, p. 1063, ed. cit.): “The garments of Christ were 
divided into four parts, and His mantle alone remained undivided, which, I may 
say, was a sign of a mystery. For the four quarters of the world, brought to salva-
tion, have shared the garment of the Word, that is, His flesh, among themselves in 
such a way that it has not been divided. For the Only-begotten, passing into each 
so as to be shared by each, and sanctifying their soul and body by His flesh, is in all 
indivisibly and entirely, since, being one, He is everywhere in no manner divided.”
179] THEOPHYLACT, on John cap. 19 (f. 825, ed. cit.): “Therefore the holy body 
of Christ is indivisible, being divided and distributed among the four quarters of 
the earth; for both being distributed among them individually, and sanctifying the 
soul of each one with the body, the Only-begotten is by His own flesh entirely and 
indivisibly in all, being everywhere; for He has been in no wise divided, as Paul also 
exclaims.”

many places, are there many Christs? Not at all. But the one Christ is everywhere, 
being completely here and completely there, one body. For as He who is offered 
in many places is one body, and not many bodies, so is He also one sacrifice. He 
is that High Priest of ours who has offered the sacrifice that cleanses us. We also 
now offer that which, having been then offered, was not consumed. This is done in 
remembrance of that which was then done. ‘This do,’ says He, ‘in remembrance of 
Me.’ For we do not make another sacrifice, as the high priest, but always the same. 
We rather bring about a remembrance of the sacrifice.” (Note: Against the propi-
tiatory sacrifice of the Mass of the Papists.)

CONCLUSION
181] Christian reader, these testimonies of the ancient teachers of the Church have 
been here set forth, not with this meaning that our Christian faith is founded upon 
the authority of men. For the true saving faith is to be founded upon no church-
teachers, old or new, but only and alone upon God’s Word, which is comprised in 
the Scriptures of the holy prophets and apostles, as unquestionable witnesses of 
divine truth. But because fanatical spirits, by the special and uncanny craft of Satan, 
wish to lead men from the Holy Scriptures – which, thank God! even a common 
layman can now profitably read – to the writings of the fathers and the ancient 
church-teachers as into a broad sea, so that he who has not read them cannot 
therefore precisely know whether they and their writings are as these new teachers 
quote their words, and thus is left in grievous doubt, – we have been compelled by 
means of this Catalogue to declare, and to exhibit to the view of all, that this new 
false doctrine has as little foundation in the ancient pure church-teachers as in the 
Holy Scriptures, but that it is diametrically opposed to it. Their testimonies they 
quote in a false meaning, contrary to the will of the fathers, just as they designedly 
and wantonly pervert the simple, plain, and clear words of Christ’s testament and 
the pure testimonies of the Holy Scriptures. On this account the Book of Concord 
directs every one to the Holy Scriptures and the simple Catechism; for he who 
clings to this simple form with true, simple faith provides best for his soul and 
conscience, since it is built upon a firm and immovable Rock, Matt. 7 and 17; Gal. 1; 
Ps. 119.
