Prologue: Education and Vocation
The calling of Lutherans and of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America in education is closely tied to a Lutheran
understanding of vocation.  While many understand vocation as
a job or career or as the call to be a pastor or priest, Lutherans
understand vocation as a calling from God that encompasses all
of life for all the faithful.
Vocation involves God’s saving call to us in baptism and life
lived in joyful response to this call.  In Jesus Christ we are loved
by a gracious God who frees us to love our neighbor and pro-
mote the common good; in gratitude for God’s love, we live out
our vocation in our places of responsibility in daily life—home,
congregation, work place, neighborhood, nation, and global
society.
Education belongs to our baptismal vocation.  Our particular
calling in education is two-fold: to educate people in the Chris-
tian faith for their vocation and to strive with others to ensure
that all have access to high-quality education that develops
personal gifts and abilities and serves the common good. This
calling embraces all people in both Church and society.

A Social Statement
We of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America
express gratitude for homes
and congregations that carry
out this calling in education.
We give thanks to God for
other institutions and indi-
viduals in all of education’s
varied settings: for public,
Lutheran, and other private early childhood education centers,
schools, colleges, and universities; for outdoor ministries and for
campus ministries; and for all who live out their vocation as
students, parents, pastors, lay professionals, teachers, adminis-
trators, staff members, directors, board members, and trustees in
these educational settings.
The ELCA’s calling in education recognizes special responsibili-
ties and accountability in certain specific areas:
z It affirms the essential role of parents and congregations in the
faith formation of young people and urges revitalization of the
baptismal commitment to educate in the faith for vocation, a
commitment that continues throughout life.
z In light of the essential role of public education in serving the
common good of the society and in the face of continuing
concern for the effectiveness of some public schools, the lack of
equitable access for many students to high-quality schools, and
the often inadequate provision of financial resources, the ELCA
affirms and advocates for the equitable, sufficient, and effective
funding of public schools.
z In view of the expanding role of ELCA early childhood educa-
tion centers and schools in providing outreach and distinctive
religious educational opportunities to growing numbers of
children, this church affirms these schools and encourages
synods, pastors, congregations, and members to claim and
support this unique mission opportunity.
z In gratitude for the extraordinary work of ELCA colleges and
universities in preparing students for vocation in the Church
and world and for ELCA seminaries in their preparation of
leaders for our church, this church affirms the role of these
institutions and encourages them to sustain and strengthen

those elements that distinguish the Lutheran tradition in higher
education and theological education.
z In gratitude for public higher education and the vital role of
ELCA campus ministries in public and private universities and
in recognition of the special cultural, missional, and financial
challenges they face, the ELCA affirms these ministries and
urges new and creative collaborative efforts in their support.
z In recognition of the growing costs of Lutheran, public, and
private higher education, which limit access for many students,
the ELCA affirms foundations, corporations, congregations,
institutions, and individuals who provide financial assistance to
students and urges both state and federal governments to
expand grant funding for low- and middle-income students
who need it.
1. What Does God Have to Do with Education?
Education, as understood in this social statement, refers in a
broad sense to learning, teaching, and knowing as a dimension
of human life.  It is a lifelong activity that permeates all that we
do.  In a narrower sense, education refers to intentional activity
in which we engage one another in learning.  People create
institutions and situations whose purposes are to encourage,
transmit, and advance human learning and to shape and equip
new generations.  Through education human beings are formed
as people, acquiring knowledge, wisdom, attitudes, beliefs,
skills, and abilities to think, feel, and act in particular ways.
When the Christian Church
talks about education, it does
so in the light of its faith in
God: Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit.  Christians believe that
God creates human beings
with ability to learn, teach, and know and that God is active in
and through education.  God’s creative activity encompasses all
people and their education, and the redeeming gospel of Jesus
Christ gives the Church a distinctive mandate in education.

The Lutheran Legacy
From the time of the Reformation, the Lutheran church has
been a teaching and learning church.  Martin Luther, a univer-
sity professor, pursued the reform of education on all levels as
an integral part of his reform of Church and society.  With his
teaching on vocation, Luther understood the Christian life to be
one of service to God and neighbor in one’s everyday places of
responsibility; education equipped Christians for this vocation.
He taught that education
served the common good of
Church and society: In a
move unusual for his day, he
taught that schools for all—
both those who were wealthy
and those who were poor,
both boys and girls—were
necessary so that the Church would have learned and faithful
pastors and the civil community would have wise and good
rulers.1  He insisted that Christians learn to read, understand,
and interpret the Bible and know the content of their faith.  He
stressed the importance of teaching faith and love in the home
by word and example, writing “The Small Catechism” to assist
parents in this task.2
Lutherans in North America and the Caribbean followed
Luther’s call to educate in home, Church, and society.  They
prayed and held devotions in the home, taught the faith in
Sunday school and through catechetical instruction, founded
schools, colleges, and seminaries of all sorts, and established
campus ministries and outdoor ministries.  They strongly sup-
ported public education, and many Lutherans have carried out
their calling as educators in a wide array of educational institu-
tions.  This legacy lives on in the Evangelical Lutheran Church
in America as one of its defining characteristics.
The God Who Calls Us
In baptism Christians are called to live in faith and hope in God
and in love to neighbor in the ordinary relationships of daily life.
Luther understood the Christian life
to be one of service to God and
neighbor in one’s everyday places
of responsibility; education
equipped Christians for this
vocation.
5
Our Calling in Education
God’s wondrous and awesome call to us gives joy, confidence,
seriousness, and purpose to all of life.  It holds together faith
and love, God and neighbor, the individual and community,
and a person’s gifts and the needs of others and of the earth.  In
our places of responsibility in family, work, society, and Church,
God’s living call comes to us to serve others, seek justice, pro-
mote the common good, and care for creation competently and
creatively with our gifts and abilities.  This Lutheran under-
standing of vocation is especially important for our approach to
education today.
Faith in the God who calls provides a critical and constructive
perspective to guide Christians in their calling in education
today.3
The God Who Calls Us Is “the Father almighty,
creator of heaven and earth”
God’s good creation, with its amazing variety and diversity,
presents the context for vocation.  A patterned and structured
reality that is reliable and knowable, creation is also changing,
open, and inexhaustible in what it discloses to human knowl-
edge.  Dependent on the one who calls it into existence out of
nothing (cf. Romans 4:17), creation’s purpose is to glorify and be
in communion with the triune God.  Education belongs to the
goodness of creation through which Christians praise the Cre-
ator.
Education depends on and
should reflect who people are
as creatures of God.  Human-
ity is one, and all are of equal
worth before God.  Education
is always to respect the
dignity we receive in being
created in “the image of
God.”  The Creator gives us responsibility for the life and educa-
tion of new generations and for making the earth a fitting home
for human beings and other creatures (Genesis 1:26-28).  To

esis 1:26-28).

A Social Statement
carry out these divine mandates we are enabled to learn, teach,
and know in a world that can be known, at least in part.
Because God creates all people as embodied minds and spirits,
education involves us as whole persons.  Our affections, will,
and intellect interact in our learning and teaching.  We come to
know in a variety of ways.  We are limited creatures, subject to
death, who learn, teach, and know with particular perspectives,
assumptions, and commitments.  Our knowledge is always
partial and we cannot know everything, so we are always
compelled to select what we should learn and teach.  As social
beings who rely on other people, we are created for living in
love with God and others and for caring for the earth on which
we depend.  We accept personal responsibility to learn and
know throughout our lives with and for others.
The necessity, capacity, love, and delight to learn, teach, and
know come from God.  Human beings are blessed with the gifts
of memory, self-consciousness, and anticipation.  We marvel at
the divinely given abilities to communicate, reason, explore new
realities, discover meaning and truth, create art, technology,
and complex societies, enjoy beauty, and discern what is right
and good.  We approach education with awe, wonder, and
gratitude to the triune God.
The God who calls all people continues to preserve and bless a
good but fallen creation.  The Bible identifies the root of what
corrupts creation as human sin, the rupture in our relationship
with God.  Instead of loving God with all our being, we turn
away from our Creator and center our lives on ourselves, consis-
tently loving ourselves more than we do God and our neighbor.
Sin profoundly disrupts and distorts human community, pen-
etrating the heart of individuals and entangling human institu-
tions.
Sin’s power persistently warps and corrupts human learning
and educational institutions.  Our lives are marked by igno-
rance—the opposite of knowledge—and by folly—the opposite
of wisdom.  In a society of inequalities, our school systems often
reinforce privilege, denying equitable access to a high-quality
education for all.  In pride humans claim too much for our
7
Our Calling in Education
limited grasp of intellectual or moral truth, and in despair we
think that there is no truth and no right and wrong.  We use
knowledge to dominate or harm others, to deny them their
humanity, and to ravish the earth rather than to serve the
neighbor.  We put our trust in our knowledge or wisdom to
justify our existence before God.
Although creation is bound in sin and death, God continues to
preserve, create, bless, and govern the world, bringing forth
ever-new wonders.  People and institutions are “masks of God,”
in Luther’s phrase.  That is, God provides for the health and
well-being of the earth and its creatures through the actions of
people and the working of human institutions, as well as by the
processes of nature.  At the same time, God holds all people
accountable to act responsibly in human affairs and enables
them to strive for and achieve degrees of “civil righteousness,”
that is, a peace and justice necessary and possible in a sinful
world.4
All people share the need and responsibility to be educated in
civil righteousness and the matters of earthly life.  We see God at
work when people dedicate themselves to this responsibility and
in the good they accomplish through their efforts.  God’s con-
tinuing creative activity calls us to support governments and
other institutions that enact just education policies and create
schools that foster human flourishing, serve the common good,
and care for creation.
The God Who Calls Us Is “Jesus Christ,
God’s only Son, our Lord”
Through the gospel, the saving news of God’s love in Jesus
Christ for sinners, Christians are freed to care for education as
an arena for service to the neighbor.  The gospel forgives us,
liberates us from the power of sin, death, and evil, and empow-
ers us to amend our lives to love the neighbor, seek justice, and
care for the earth.  Education is not a means to secure our
personal salvation but a way to benefit the neighbor.
8
A Social Statement
Justified before God by grace alone, through faith alone, on
account of Jesus Christ alone, Christians do not look to human
learning, teaching, and knowing as means to reconcile us with
God.  Our lives do not receive ultimate meaning by how much
learning or academic recognition we have.  The gospel frees us
from judging our human worth and that of others by their
education or any other accomplishment.
Christians live the paradox of being sinners and saints at the
same time, struggling with the realities of imperfection, ambigu-
ity, and evil in and around us; yet we are people on the way,
constantly transformed by God’s grace and awaiting the resur-
rection of the dead and the fulfillment of the whole creation in
God’s eternal reign.  Confident of the gospel’s promise of God’s
final victory, we live out our
calling in education now
under the cross as forgiven
sinners, turning daily to God
to confess our sin and receive
forgiveness and new life.
The one who saves us is also our teacher.  By his life and teach-
ings, Jesus of Nazareth teaches us what it means to be truly
human, living and dying for others.  He teaches us to love God
with our whole being—including with all our mind—and our
neighbor as ourselves (Luke 10:27).  He bids us to care for “the
least of these who are members of my family” (Matthew 25:40;
see also vv. 31-46).
The God Who Calls Is “the Holy Spirit”
By means of the gospel the Holy Spirit calls us into the Church,
the community of believers that gathers around Word and
Sacrament.  The risen Lord Jesus instructs his followers to
“go . . . make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and
teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you”
(Matthew 28:19-20; italics added).  Christians teach and learn in
the Church so that we will not be conformed to the world but

Our Calling in Education
instead be disciples who are transformed by the renewing of our
minds (Romans 12:2).
The Church has been given
the distinctive mandate to
educate in the faith for voca-
tion—to instruct, form, and
bring forth faithful, coura-
geous, and wise disciples to
live out their baptismal
vocation in Church and
world.  In baptism, believers are buried with Christ into death
and freed to “walk in newness of life” (Romans 6:4), to a new
way of being in the world marked by faith, hope, and love.
In educating for our vocation given in baptism, Christians rely
on the Holy Spirit to work through us to shape our character
and to produce “the fruit of the Spirit[:] . . . love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-
control” (Galatians 5:22-23).  The same Spirit gives us varieties
of gifts “for the common good” (1 Corinthians 12:4-7).  Sharing
one hope, “one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and
Father of all,” we members of the body contribute in different
ways “to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building
up the body of Christ” (Ephesians 4:5, 12).  We build up life in
community by discerning and nurturing members’ gifts, receiv-
ing them in gratitude, and sharing our gifts joyfully.
Dependent on the Holy Spirit, education in the Church centers
in worship—in Word and Sacrament—and permeates all of
congregational life and mission.  It addresses us as whole people
in our relationships, shaping the way we think, feel, and act.  It
strengthens our trust in the gospel, cultivates the gifts of the
Spirit, and teaches us what is true about God’s relationship with
creation on the basis of the Bible and the Church’s doctrines.  It
encourages us to understand and affirm the content of our faith
in ways that invite us into the wondrous mystery of God’s love
for the world that passes all understanding.
The Church has been given the
distinctive mandate to educate in
the faith for vocation—to instruct,
form, and bring forth faithful,
courageous, and wise disciples to
live out their baptismal vocation in
Church and world.
10
A Social Statement
The Church in education confesses and gives voice to God’s
ultimate truth for humankind and creation revealed in the
gospel.  In seeking to discern and understand God’s truth and
its meaning for life, the Church teaches the knowledge of faith
boldly and in a spirit of humility, knowing “now we see in a
mirror, dimly” (1 Corinthians 13:12).  At the same time the
Church in education learns from and is challenged by knowl-
edge and insight coming from all people.  Instead of dismissing
this learning in the name of faith or faith in the name of such
learning, Christians say “yes” both to faith and its knowledge
and to God’s gift of reason.
Confident that the God
revealed in Jesus Christ is the
source of all truth, we affirm
and value the discovery and
transmission of true knowl-
edge wherever and however
it occurs.  Paul’s admonition
voices our open, discerning attitude toward human learning:
“Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just,
whatever is pure, whatever is pleasing, whatever is commend-
able, if there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of
praise, think about these things” (Philippians 4:8).
The ELCA’s calling in education energetically pursues excellent
education in this church and society.  If we neglect teaching the
faith for vocation, we betray our distinctive mandate and are
unprepared to serve our neighbor in the world.  If we neglect
our responsibilities for the education of all people in earthly
matters and civil righteousness, we close our eyes to God’s
continuous creating activity and fall short in loving our neigh-
bor and serving the common good.  Education in both society
and Church is God-pleasing, for the God who calls us in voca-
tion is both Creator and Preserver and Redeemer and Sanctifier.
Our Calling in Education Today
The ELCA lives its calling in education today in a world that is
increasingly interconnected and in a society that is becoming
more pluralistic.  Contemporary culture brings new marvels yet
Confident that the God revealed in

truth, we affirm and value the

knowledge wherever and however it

11
Our Calling in Education
also conveys messages that hinder learning and clash with the
Church’s beliefs.  Science and technology continuously reshape
our world, bringing new benefits as well as new dangers and
creating new moral dilemmas and theological challenges.  Many
voices point to the crucial significance of early childhood educa-
tion as well as to the need for and the possibilities of lifelong
learning.  Millions of men, women, and children in our affluent
society live in poverty, and most young people who live in
poverty do not have fair access to good schools.  The needs of
students with differing abilities are not always being met effec-
tively.  Recognizing how essential formal education is for living
in today’s world, our society has developed an elaborate array
of public and private schools from preschool through post-
graduate.  Yet performance of educational institutions in this
society is often criticized, and many reform proposals are ad-
vanced.
Within this complex, changing, and challenging context the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America claims and aspires to
renew its calling in education.  We are grateful for and chal-
lenged by the legacy we have received, and we are aware that
we too often fall short in our calling.  We pledge to sustain,
renew, and where need be,
reform our calling in educa-
tion for this time and place so
that we will be a stronger,
livelier, and more faithful
teaching and learning
church.
This calling in education belongs to this whole church.  Indi-
viduals, families, congregations, early childhood education
centers and schools, colleges and universities, seminaries, out-
door ministries, campus ministries, lifelong learning centers,
publishing ministry, social ministry organizations, synods, and
the churchwide organization all participate in this calling.  It
involves lifelong learning in formal and informal settings.  It
includes pastors and bishops as teachers of the faith who speak
to heart and mind and who address public issues of education.
In this calling in education we learn from ecumenical partners,

place so that we will be a stronger,

other churches, and the Church throughout the world and ages
as well as from other religions and secular knowledge.  We
honor and support parents, pastors, students, educators, citi-
zens, and all who carry out their callings in education.
This social statement calls the ELCA in light of our faith to
engage, deliberate, and act with respect to four contexts: home
and congregation, public education, this church’s educational
institutions, and public colleges and universities.  Our calling in
education is to:
· communicate the faith to children and youth with power
and conviction in home and congregation where lifelong
learning in the faith is expected and encouraged;
· advocate equitable access to excellent education for all
young people;
· sustain and strengthen early childhood education centers,
schools, colleges and universities, and seminaries as an
integral and integrated part of this church’s mission in
education; and
· support public higher education to serve the common good
and rejoice in the faithful presence of campus ministry in
public colleges and universities.
2. What Faith Will Our Children Have?
Faith Formation from Generation to Generation
Luther taught, “Anything on which your heart relies and
depends, I say, that is really your God.”5 All have faith in
something; the question is, is it trust in the living God or in
something else?  Will our children be nurtured and transformed
by the faith and community that trust and confess the God who
calls us?
Few questions are more urgent and significant for this church’s
life and mission.  The answers will depend in large part on
whether or not we nurture our children and encourage adults
to grow in faith throughout their entire lives.  Children brought
to the baptismal font often become distant from the community
13
Our Calling in Education
of faith as they move toward becoming adults.  Many adults do
not consider their own ongoing and intentional faith formation
to be vital to their lives as Christians.
Each generation faces its own challenges in maintaining, nur-
turing, and passing on the faith.  In our time these challenges
are profound and pervasive.  Attempts to communicate the
faith face the demands and the fragmentation of modern life,
numerous religions and ideologies competing for our loyalty,
and the ever-present messages that tell us that success and
happiness come from consuming goods and pursuing individual
desires and pleasures.  The disconnect between home and
congregation, the hesitance of Christians to witness to the
gospel, and their lack of commitment to be lifelong learners
impair continued faith formation.
Lifelong Learning
Faith formation is a gift of the Holy Spirit that continues
throughout life.  This truth shapes the ELCA’s understanding
and practice of educating in the faith for vocation.  A teaching
and learning church invites the baptized of all ages—from
infants to older adults—into a
continuous discipline of
learning and faith formation.
As Christians mature in their
knowledge and experience in
the world, their faith also
should deepen and mature.  If their knowledge of the faith fails
to keep up with their knowledge of the world, then their under-
standing of God will be affected.  As people grow older, a
changing world presents new questions and dilemmas to them,
and based on their continuing life experience, they raise new
questions about their world and faith.  Continued growth and
learning in the faith enable Christians to see how their faith
gives direction and sheds light on their changing lives.
Because learning and being formed in the faith are lifelong
opportunities and tasks, the ELCA urges Christians throughout

A Social Statement
their lives to assume personal responsibility to grow in their
faith by:
· deepening their relationship with God through worship
and prayer;
· maturing in their knowledge of the Bible and the Church’s
doctrines;
· learning by doing, practicing their faith in daily living,
service, and justice;
· learning and using the art and skills of speaking the truth
in love and discerning together the gospel’s meaning for
life;6 and
· connecting their baptismal vocation and their specific
callings in daily life.
Where adults are vigorous learners in the faith, children and
young people will have models and companions for their own
learning, adults will learn from children and young people, and
all generations will grow together in their faith.
“Let the little children come to me”
While adults are responsible for their own lifelong learning, they
also bear a particular responsibility to nurture the faith of the
next generation.  The Bible communicates a keen sense of how
generations are bound together in networks of mutual obliga-
tion.  The elder generation is to transmit its knowledge, wisdom,
and faith, and the younger generation is to honor the blessings it
receives.  “Train children in the right way, and when old, they
will not stray” (Proverbs 22:6).  The Bible as well as church
history testifies to the significance of educating children in the
faith.  Experience and contemporary studies confirm the impor-
tance of early childhood education.  Passing on the faith to a
new generation begins in infancy and continues through adult-
hood.
Jesus invited the children (Mark 10:13-16; cf., Matthew 19:13-
15; Luke 18:15-17), and so we are to welcome children, teaching
and learning from them in ways that recognize their dignity
and complexity.  The Church’s traditions on children help us to
15
Our Calling in Education
understand children from different perspectives and to hold
these diverse ways together in tension.7
For example, children are both:
· gifts of God.  God entrusts parents, the Church, and society
to welcome and care for children as full participants of
their communities.  As gifts of God, children are sources of
hope, joy, delight, and also obligation.
· and sinful creatures and moral agents.  Children, “re-born” in
baptism, share in the solidarity and equality of sin common
to all (Romans 3:10).  Furthermore, children are moral
agents who have growing degrees of responsibility for
what they do and who may act in ways that are self-
centered and harmful to themselves and others.
Recognizing that children are sinful is never a warrant to
abuse and treat them inhumanely; rather it is a caution
against an idealistic view of children as primarily innocent
beings who automatically love God and others.  Children,
therefore, need to be formed for their vocation and that
with gentleness and love.
Children are both:
· fully human and made in the image of God.  Children,
therefore, are worthy of the dignity and respect due to all
human beings.  Jesus reinforced the dignity of all children
by welcoming and blessing them and saying that to them
belongs the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 19:14, 15).
· and developing beings who need instruction and guidance.
Children require nurture and guidance to develop into
intellectually, morally, and spiritually mature adults.
Children are both:
· models and teachers of faith.  In striking ways, Jesus held up
children as teachers of adults.  “Truly I tell you, unless you
change and become like children, you will never enter the
kingdom of heaven.  Whoever becomes humble like this
child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew
18:3, 4).
· and orphans, neighbors, and strangers in need of justice and
compassion.  The Bible also reminds us that children may be
among the most vulnerable members of society.  Many are
impoverished, neglected, abandoned, and abused.  They
16
A Social Statement
need protection, justice, and compassion.  Children are
our neighbors whom we are called to love.
Christians enrich our welcoming of children to a life of faith by
holding together these diverse perspectives on whom they are.
Because they are gifts of God, for example, we will respect their
dignity and bring joy, laughter, and a sense of obligation into
teaching and forming them in home and congregation.  Because
they—like all the baptized—are sinners as well as saints and in
need of instruction, we will emphasize the vital role of families
in instilling the habits and practices of faithful living, and we
will develop substantial congregational programs of faith forma-
tion.  We will introduce them to good examples, mentors, and
stories of faith and service and help them discern their callings.
Remembering that Jesus saw children as teachers of the faith,
we will listen attentively to them, honor their insights and
questions, and learn from them.  We will give special attention
to children who are most vulnerable and those who have been
wounded, and we will become stronger advocates for them.
A Mutual Environment of Living Faith
Both home and congregation are responsible for passing on the
faith to children and youth.  Where each carries out its responsi-
bility faithfully and is engaged in a fruitful partnership with the
other—trusting in the Holy Spirit to bless their faithfulness—
children and youth are baptized, grow, and dwell in an envi-
ronment of living faith.
In such an environment, both home and congregation anchor
their teaching in the Bible and in Luther’s “The Small Cat-
echism.”  They nurture in children and youth faith, hope, and
love.  They teach and discuss the Church’s doctrines, creeds, the
liturgy, and moral beliefs.  They live out together Christian
practices, such as praying, worshiping, singing, visiting people
who are sick, seeking justice with people who experience pov-
erty or discrimination, and caring for the earth.
Many children and youth, however, do not experience a mutu-
ally supportive environment in home and congregation.  Most
17
Our Calling in Education
baptized children grow up in homes where faith formation is
not part of everyday living, even among families who are active
in congregational life.8  Adolescent youth who identify them-
selves as Christians often have great difficulty explaining what
they believe.  Many have a vague concept of God and view
religion as merely an instrument to make them happy and
morally good.9  After catechetical instruction many young
people begin to lose interest in participating in congregational
life.  Parents and other caregivers often do not educate their
children in the faith for vocation, and congregations often do
little to encourage and assist them.  We dare not ignore the
seriousness of this state of affairs.
Reform begins at baptism, where congregations and sponsors
and home meet.  At baptism, through which God grants us new
life, parents and sponsors commit themselves before God and
the congregation to educate children in the faith.10  Pastors,
associates in ministry, diaconal ministers, deaconesses, and the
community of faith need to remind parents, caregivers, and
sponsors of their pledge and
help them fulfill it, and par-
ents need to remind pastors
and the community of faith to
help them.
Parents nurture and instruct
in the faith by offering a good
example to their children.
They do so by modeling
prayer, hymn singing, Bible study, and private devotional
reading; attending worship and Sunday school with their
children and participating in the life of the congregation; serv-
ing the poor and caring for creation; and witnessing to the
gospel and faithfully living out their callings.  Providing a good
example, however, is not enough.  Parents’ awesome responsi-
bility also includes encouraging their children to pray publicly
and privately, read devotions, witness to their faith, deepen
their knowledge of their faith, and take part in activities of
generosity, service, and justice.  Families have unique opportuni-
ties to talk together about matters of faith and vocation.  As
Pastors and the community of
faith need to remind parents,
caregivers, and sponsors of their
pledge to educate their children in
the faith and help them fulfill it,
and parents need to remind
pastors and the community of
faith to help them.
18
A Social Statement
parents teach the faith, they learn from their children and are
themselves more deeply formed in the faith.  The home itself is
to be a domestic church for the whole family.
Parents cannot undertake this important task unsupported.  In
baptizing children, congregations also accept responsibility for
forming children and youth in the faith.  Equipping parents for
their vocation as parents belongs among a congregation’s chief
priorities.  This begins by teaching persistently and boldly that it
is the calling and obligation as well as the delight of parents to
educate their young people in the faith.  Where parents are not
involved in educating in the faith, congregations have height-
ened responsibility to take on this challenge.
Congregations’ responsibility includes providing strong pro-
grams of faith formation for children and youth that involve
parents and other adults.  Through classes, parenting groups,
and mentoring programs, congregations provide opportunities
to study the Scriptures, to discuss fears and hopes, to learn new
ideas, and to become acquainted with resources to support
those responsible for the task of forming children in the faith.
Congregations should welcome children and youth of all ages in
worship, Sunday school, catechetical instruction, and youth
ministry and be attentive to the changes going on in young
peoples’ lives.  They will give special attention to engaging post-
confirmation youth in the congregation’s life.  Parents and
congregations may also encourage lifelong growth in faith
through Lutheran schools, lifelong learning centers, Lutheran
campus ministries, and Lutheran colleges and universities.
Congregations also can strengthen the faith formation of chil-
dren, youth, and adults by encouraging them to take part in this
church’s outdoor ministries.  Congregations also should encour-
age outdoor ministries to offer programs to those with disabili-
ties.  Numerous conference centers, camps, and retreat centers
positively shape the faith and lives of people of all ages.  Many
young people, families, and leaders of this church testify to the
important role of these outdoor ministries in their faith forma-
tion and spiritual development.11
19
Our Calling in Education
ELCA seminaries provide important support for those involved
in the faith formation of all ages.  The Lutheran tradition has
long valued the teaching role in the congregation of those
trained in theological education, and we look to pastors, dea-
conesses, diaconal ministers, associates in ministry, and lay
leaders to work with congregations and parents in the crucial
task of forming the faith of all generations.  This church, there-
fore, expects seminaries to take seriously the importance of
Christian education and youth and family ministry and to
educate all students for excellence in leadership in these areas.
We also call upon the ELCA to continue and expand the provi-
sion of creative and comprehensive resources necessary to
enable parents and congregations to help form the faith of all
generations.
Equipping Faithful and Discerning Students
During their formative years, young people face the challenge of
learning to discern and pursue what is good and right amid
conflicting ideas and enticing alternative ways of living.  An
environment of living faith equips them to grow and mature in
their baptismal calling in a pluralistic culture that exhibits both
God’s goodness and sin’s corruption.  In such an environment
parents willingly accept their obligation for their children, create
the structure and climate for children to grow in freedom, and
set parameters on how the culture will be allowed to influence
their children.
Especially important during
these formative years is their
schooling experience.  Parents
as well as congregations will
teach their children and young people that being a student is a
calling—a way to serve God and others.  They will convey to
them a love for learning that opens youthful minds to the
exciting quest for knowledge.  Faith inspires us to understand
God’s world and to delight in the discovery of truth.  Students
are called to take the wonderful opportunity and demanding
responsibility of learning with utmost seriousness, showing
Being a student is a calling—a
way to serve God and others.
20
A Social Statement
diligence, discipline, lively interest, honesty, creativity, and
respect for their teachers.
In fulfilling their baptismal pledge, parents will carefully con-
sider where their children attend school and the education they
receive.  Whether they send their children to a public school, a
Lutheran school, other Christian school, private school, or home
school them, parents will be concerned that their children
receive a high-quality education and develop a vibrant faith
active in love.  Parents weigh many factors in selecting a school.
Some of these factors are the gifts and needs of the child, the
schooling options available, the desire or not for a faith-based
education, and the cost.  Pastors, other rostered leaders, and
other congregational members can help parents think through
their possibilities, and congregations can support them in their
options.
Schools rightly expose their students to a wide variety of ideas,
beliefs, and values but often find it difficult to provide a basis on
which to evaluate moral and belief systems.  When schools do
not teach about religion, students may conclude that religion is
not important for “real life” or that what is right and wrong is
only a “matter of opinion.” Some schools, including religious
ones, may promote beliefs and attitudes that denigrate certain
racial, ethnic, religious, or other groups of people.
Attentive to what their children are learning in school, home
and congregation will seek to deepen their young people’s
understanding of their faith and vocation.  Pastors, other educa-
tional leaders, and parents will seize opportunities to listen
carefully to their questions, to explore openly their struggles and
concerns, to help them make sense of their faith and learning,
and to discern what is good and true in a contested world.
Guidelines for the Ministry of Faith Formation
How congregations carry out their educational responsibilities
for children, youth, and adults of all ages takes many forms.
21
Our Calling in Education
The following guidelines are designed to help congregations
focus intentionally on faith formation:
Educational ministries will:
· rely on the Holy Spirit to work through education to form,
guide, and enlighten learners in the faith;
· inspire, inform, and challenge children, youth, and adults,
including those with disabilities, with faithful, interesting,
and effective teaching and learning;
· implement educational materials and programs that are
rooted in the triune God, the Bible, and the Lutheran
Confessions;
· plan and assure that the education ministry of the
congregation is centered in and flows out of worship;
· encourage Christians to be lifelong learners in the faith,
providing opportunities for all to grow in their faith and to
be equipped for their vocation in the Church and the
world;
· provide opportunities for discussing and studying social
issues, ethics, science, and other religions in light of faith;
· incorporate the best teaching and learning methods
available with a willingness to try new approaches; and
· incorporate educational programs and practices
appropriate to the age, interest, learning abilities, and other
characteristics of the people for whom they are intended.
Children, youth, and family ministries will:
· welcome and educate all children and youth in ways that
recognize their wonderful complexity and dignity;
· give priority to the ministries of children, youth, and
families through trained leadership, finances, and re-
sources; and
· work to strengthen the family and to create an intentional
partnership between the congregation and the home.
Educational ministry leadership will:
· support the pastors and other leaders who are called to be
teachers of the faith;
· provide for the ongoing education of teachers;12 and
· draw on the resources and people available in this church,
including ELCA program units, and take advantage of
opportunities offered by our seminaries, colleges, and
lifelong learning centers.13
22
A Social Statement
A vibrant congregational ministry in education for children,
youth, and adults carries out the biblical mandate “to equip the
saints” (Ephesians 4:12) and prepares them for their vocation in
daily life.  It gives us hope that all of the generations will have a
living faith in the God who calls us.
3. Will All Children and Youth Have Access
to High-quality Education?
Schools for All
“A city’s best and greatest welfare, safety, and strength consist
in its having many able, learned, wise, honorable, and well-
educated citizens.”14 So wrote Luther in his appeal to city
governments to establish schools.  Then as now, effective schools
are a blessing to society, preparing students for their future
callings and responsibilities.  In order that students will be
prepared for their callings and responsibilities, the ELCA ex-
pects all schools—public, private, Lutheran, other religious, or
home schools—to fulfill at least four purposes for students in
age-appropriate ways.  Schools should:
  1) prepare students academically;
  2) encourage their personal flourishing, developing their
knowledge and wisdom and instilling a delight in
learning;
  3) prepare students for productive work and financial
responsibility; and
  4) equip them to live and serve in a complex, diverse, and
interdependent global society and to be responsible and
civil citizens.
High-quality schools excel in accomplishing these purposes.
While public, religious, and private schools, as well as home
schooling, contribute to the common good of our society, public
schools remain the principal educational institutions for chil-
dren and youth from kindergarten through high school.  Most
students in our society—nearly 90 percent—are enrolled in
public schools.  These government-run and tax-supported
schools represent the most significant public commitment to
23
Our Calling in Education
provide formal education for all young people.
The American and Puerto Rican societies rightly place high
expectations on public schools.  In providing access to education
for all, public schools are to generate a more equitable society.
By bringing together students from all sectors of society, they are
to help nurture shared values, cultural understanding, and
social harmony.  By developing the potential of each student,
they are to prepare students for work, family life, and citizen-
ship and thereby promote economic well-being and the common
good.  Some also expect public schools to help solve pressing
social issues such as poor health, violence, poverty, and disabil-
ity.  Yet resources to support these expectations compete with
the demands of other public responsibilities such as health,
human services, and public safety.
While public schools historically have enjoyed widespread
public support, in recent decades public discourse about them
often has been shaped by
criticism and discontent.  The
ELCA reaffirms its commit-
ment to the concept and work
of public schools, and joins
with others in seeking change
where they do not live up to
expectations.  Especially do
we call for public attention and action on behalf of those chil-
dren and youth who are not receiving a good education.  The
ELCA urgently presses the question: Will all children and youth
have access to high-quality education?
The Commitment to Public Schools
Public schools vary in size, culture, and quality.  The challenges
and opportunities they face differ according to their context,
and people’s experiences with them vary.  Recognizing both this
diversity and what is common about public schools, and draw-
ing upon our theology, the ELCA sets out certain attitudes,
guidelines, and expectations to inform its commitment to public
schools.
The ELCA reaffirms its commit-
ment to the concept and work of
public schools, and joins with
others in seeking change where
they do not live up to expecta-
tions.
24
A Social Statement
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America view public
schools with gratitude.  We are grateful for the educational
achievements of public schools in the past and present.  We
rejoice in the opportunity for education that public schools offer
to all children, including children who suffer the effects of
poverty and discrimination and to children with special learn-
ing needs.  We recognize how public schools in various situa-
tions bring together children and youth from many different
social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds—including those
from new immigrant populations—for a common education in a
spirit of civic equality.  We are thankful for all who teach and
work in and for public schools with dedication, ability, and
care.
The ELCA views public schools with realism, hope, and wisdom.
Because we recognize human limitations and the power of sin,
we are prepared to be critical where public schools fall short,
and we seek to be conscious of our own limitations and how our
self-interest may influence and distort our views.  Our faith in
God keeps alive our hope to seek workable solutions to seem-
ingly insolvable problems, including those in public education.
This is a tough hope that calls
for sustained effort, not easy
answers.  It treasures wisdom
and knowledge in discerning
what actions best serve the
education of children and
youth.
This church understands the education of young people to be a
shared responsibility.  Parents and schools as well as religious
bodies and community all share this responsibility.  A responsi-
bility requires a corresponding right or authority to fulfill it.
Parents have primary, but not exclusive, responsibility for the
education of their children.  This responsibility obligates them to
be involved in their children’s education in home, school, and
congregation.  It also gives parents the right to select whether to
send their children to public, religious, or private schools or to
home school them.
The education of young people is
a  shared responsibility among
parents, schools, religious bodies,
and community.
25
Our Calling in Education
Because children are God’s gifts to society and the Church as
well as to parents, society through government also has respon-
sibility and authority to provide for young people’s education.
This responsibility and right are derived both from parents’
consent and from government’s mandate to provide for the
common good and the well-being of those in its jurisdiction.
This responsibility gives government the right to levy taxes for
education, enact compulsory attendance laws, set educational
standards, and operate public schools.  The shared responsibility
between parents and public schools and their teachers should be
one of partnership.
Expectations for Public Schools
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America expect
schools to be communities of learning and teaching.  Schools—all
schools—should strive above all to be communities in which
people with distinct roles join together in mutual respect around
the common concern for learning, teaching, and knowing.
Communities of learning and teaching ought to be places of
thoughtful and civil instruction and dialogue.  In addressing
social needs (to reduce poverty or improve health, for example),
schools should do so principally as an educational community,
as occasions for learning and teaching.  When public schools
perform other social functions for the best interest of children
(for example, providing breakfast or caring for children after
school), government should ensure they have adequate re-
sources in addition to resources supporting their primary educa-
tional purpose.  Their extracurricular opportunities in sports,
the arts, and forensics should develop healthy leadership and
encourage strong academic performance.  School organization
should facilitate schools’ identity as communities of learning
and teaching.
In a community of learning students should learn to think and
read critically, write and speak clearly, and understand math
and science competently.  They will know how to analyze,
reformulate, synthesize, and solve problems.  They will become
acquainted with a wide variety of humanistic, scientific, artistic,
and practical subject matters.  They will be introduced both to
26
A Social Statement
the broadly accepted content
of different disciplines and to
the processes and methods by
which these disciplines arrive
at their conclusions.  They
will come to think on their
own, to ask questions, and to be creative in their learning.  They
will learn to care for their health and how to stay physically fit.
To prepare their students, schools require competent leadership
from principals and boards, good teachers and counselors,
research-based teaching methods and curricula, adequate
facilities and resources; parental and community support and
involvement; and eager students.  When public schools are not
accomplishing these purposes adequately, citizens have a re-
sponsibility to work to improve them.  Public attention to social
and economic influences on student readiness is also essential so
that students are not hungry, in ill health, or victims of violence
or abuse.
The ELCA expects communities of learning and teaching to be
safe places.  We recognize that school safety is an issue for all
students, staff, and teachers.  Unfortunately, incidents of bully-
ing, intimidation, and other forms of violence are not unusual.
We affirm that personal safety and security are essential for
optimal teaching and learning.
In recognition of the differing ability and needs of students, this
church is committed to the education of students with disabili-
ties.  This entails the provision of needed technical and adaptive
technology, qualified teachers and staff, appropriate curricula
and programs, and support services.
This church affirms that public schools have a role in teaching
and forming students to live morally in society, what Lutherans
call “civil righteousness.” This task raises many dilemmas in our
pluralistic society.  Yet no education is morally neutral, and
public schools do communicate moral beliefs and values.  Public
schools, therefore, ought to teach the principles and virtues of
living together in responsible freedom in a democratic society,
In a community of learning stu-
dents should learn to think and
read critically, write and speak
clearly, and understand math and
science competently.
27
Our Calling in Education
which includes respect for the
diverse cultures and beliefs of
their students.  Moral educa-
tion suited for public schools
will draw upon what the
community holds in common
and teach in a fair and impar-
tial way on those issues on which the community is divided.15
This church expects public schools to teach about religion as a
vital part of human life and culture.  When they do not teach
about religion, public schools leave students with a distorted
picture of the world.  Public schools as government institutions
should not sponsor religious exercises such as prayer or devo-
tional reading of religious texts nor advocate for or against any
particular religion.16  They should, however, help their students
understand the importance of religion for individuals, history,
and contemporary life by teaching about the beliefs, practices,
and history of different religions in fair and informative ways.
This will require competent teachers and good curricula.
The ELCA affirms the search for truth and meaning in its many
different forms.  Public schools, therefore, should address the
full scope of human knowing, including the arts, humanities,
social and natural sciences, mathematics, and technology.  The
curricula should present the
best current knowledge and
method in each discipline.  In
teaching the natural and
physical sciences, we expect
public schools to acknowl-
edge the distinctions between
them and religion.  Both ways
of knowing have their own
integrity and limits in method and purpose.  While religion and
faith provide subject matter and methods to speak of God’s role
in the origin and purpose of creation, we do not claim that they
provide a scientific account of how the natural world functions.
While the natural and physical sciences have tested methods to
describe and explain the natural world and we learn from them,
This church affirms that public
schools have a role in teaching
and forming students to live
morally in society, what Lutherans
call “civil righteousness.”
The ELCA affirms the search for
truth and meaning in its many
different forms. In teaching the
sciences, schools should
acknowledge the distinctions
between them and religion.
28
A Social Statement
we do not look to science to answer religious questions.  Schools
and teachers should respect the distinct approaches to truth and
knowledge in the natural and physical sciences and religion,
explore the philosophical issues in their relationship, and recog-
nize moral questions that may arise from them and various
proposed answers to these questions.
Expectations of this Church
The ELCA encourages its congregations and pastors to develop
strong connections with their public schools for the sake of the
children in their communities.  While respecting the other’s
purpose and character, congregations and public schools should
understand themselves to be allies in serving children and
youth.
· Congregations can join with public schools in affirming the
importance of education and countering views that de-
value or denigrate education.
· Congregations can ask their public schools how they can
assist students and provide space and volunteers for after-
school activities such as tutoring.
· Pastors and other rostered leaders can make themselves
available as resource people in teaching about religion, and
they and Lutheran social ministry organizations can be of
assistance when schools experience a crisis where
counseling and support are needed.
· In communities with release-time programs, congregations
and public schools have special opportunities to work
together in providing religious instruction for those families
who want it.
· Congregations should encourage members to be involved in
their schools, willing to serve in volunteer and elected
positions, and support teachers and students in their
calling.
· Congregations and public school officials can meet to
discuss scheduling of activities and events and other issues
of mutual interest.
· Lutheran and public schools can enter into mutually
beneficial relationships.
29
Our Calling in Education
· Congregations and public schools can cooperate in in-
structing teachers and students about how students may
appropriately exercise their religious freedom in public
schools, including the right of equal access for student-led
religious groups.  Public schools are not “religion-free
zones”; voluntary and non-disruptive religious expressions
by students are permissible.17
Equitable Access to High-quality Education for All
Because all are created in God’s image, all have equal worth and
dignity and should be treated accordingly.  This belief stands
behind our strong support for our society’s expectation that all
young people have equitable access to high-quality schools.  All
students are entitled to good schools, and when they receive a
high-quality education, society benefits.  In educating millions,
public schools continue to achieve notable successes in fulfilling
this expectation.
Public schools have provided a widespread, high level of educa-
tion as the country’s scientific, technological, cultural, and
economic leadership demonstrates.  Researchers differ, how-
ever, on the quality of public school education.  Some argue that
given the nature of public support and the resources provided,
public schools do well when compared to public education
systems in other countries.  Others argue that public schools are
not meeting the challenges of an increasingly complex and
competitive global economy.18  All agree that public schools face
the enormous task of offering high-quality education to prepare
citizens and workers for today’s knowledge-based global world.
The ELCA’s commitment to equitable access for all calls us to
attend to the glaring inequities in this country’s schooling.  The
disturbing reality persists that too many young people do not
have access to good public schools.  This reality is most perva-
sive in poor communities, especially where poverty is inter-
twined with a history of racism and discrimination.  More than
a half-century after the Supreme Court’s Brown v.  Board of
Education decision, many schools remain racially separate and
unequal,19 often in connection with residential segregation.
30
A Social Statement
Schools where a substantial majority of students live in poverty
consistently represent schools with the fewest resources and
some of the lowest performances.20  Federal, state, and district
funding often shortchange schools that serve students who need
the most support from their schools, for example, educational
funding from the federal government to American Indian and
Alaska Native communities, both on and off reservations.21
The connection between persistent poverty along with discrimi-
nation and lack of equitable access to high-quality schools
means that many factors contribute to this society’s failure to
educate all young people.  People who are poor face daily a vast
assortment of interlocking hardships related to low-paying jobs,
inadequate housing in dangerous and unhealthy environments,
poor health and physical disabilities, disrupted families, lan-
guage barriers, unwise personal choices, as well as inadequate
schools.  One of this society’s greatest challenges is to attend to
all the factors that contribute to poverty.  Good schools alone
cannot break the cycle of generational poverty, yet they have an
indispensable role in doing so.  American and Puerto Rican
societies have an obligation to do all they can to realize the
dreams of children and youth who live in poverty that educa-
tion will improve their lives.
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, therefore,
commit ourselves to work with others for public policies that
boldly and consistently push toward ensuring that all students
have equitable access to high-quality schools.  We oppose all
forms of invidious or harmful
discrimination.  We affirm
that public schools and their
teachers should set high
expectations for all students,
challenge them all to achieve
these expectations, and have
the means to meet these
expectations.  Commitment to
equitable access to high-quality schools for all, along with
commitment to combat poverty in all its dimensions, has great
potential to improve the academic performance of students who
do not now have opportunity to benefit from good education.22
We commit ourselves to work with
others for public policies that

quality schools.
31
Our Calling in Education
As a church body, the ELCA has the calling to focus public
attention on the vast inequities in our educational system, to
voice the hope and obligation of achieving equitable access to
high-quality schools for all students, and to help create condi-
tions to deliberate about and act on that calling.  As individual
Christians in our calling as citizens, we have responsibility and
competence to determine what specific measures will most
improve equitable access for
all students to high-quality
schools in our communities,
states, and nation.
Evaluating Educational
Reforms
Citizens, political officeholders, educators, and researchers
representing a wide range of attitudes toward public schools
recognize that public schools should and can do better in im-
proving the performance of their students.  When they are
considering any proposed school reform, we encourage all
citizens to evaluate it in terms of its appropriateness, effective-
ness, and cost.  They should ask of a proposal:
· Does it improve educational quality for all students?
· Is it effective in enhancing student learning?
· Does it assist educators in their work?
· Is it affordable and sustainable?
· Does it protect students from invidious discrimination?
· Is it supported by reliable research?
· Is there a means to evaluate the results of the program and
decide if the program should be continued, modified, or
ended?
Moving Toward Equitable Access
The ELCA calls upon its members to consider the following
measures:

32
A Social Statement
Countering the Negative Effects of Poverty and Discrimination
Because poverty and discrimination have such a large and
negative impact on student learning, this church calls for public
policies that give top priority to children and youth who do not
have equitable access to good education, both in large cities and
rural areas, and on American Indian reservations and in Alaska
Native communities.  This requires compensatory measures for
children and young people who are encumbered by social
disadvantages to increase their chances of equal opportunity for
a good education.  This includes:
· providing resources and opportunities to overcome the
negative effects of poverty and injustice;
· broadening the tax base and funding strategies to achieve
adequate funding for every school;
· expanding and funding good early childhood education for
children in poverty and special education, which increases
the possibilities of later educational success.  Such
education is a model for developing other programs for
students who live in poverty and suffer discrimination;
· creating incentives to attract high-quality teachers,
administrators, and staff to schools where most students
live in poverty.  Such incentives will go beyond higher
salaries to include providing a supportive climate for
teachers to innovate and be more effective in their
instruction;
· involving parents and care givers in their children’s
education through parental classes and other means; and
· creating opportunities for education that cross ethnic,
social, economic, and jurisdictional lines.
Equity in Funding
Large discrepancies in per-pupil funding in school districts
within the same state are a major barrier to equitable access to
high-quality schools for all students.  While increased funds by
themselves do not ensure better educational results, their strate-
gic investment can make a difference.23  Moreover, equity in
funding among school districts is a matter of justice and is
mandated in most state constitutions.  In states where per-pupil
33
Our Calling in Education
funding is vastly unequal
(usually where school dis-
tricts rely on local property
taxes for their revenue),
citizens should work actively
to reform the funding sys-
tem.24  Reforms should be
evaluated in terms of their
effectiveness in improving
student learning.
School Choice
A growing number of school districts and states seek to increase
the range of schools students can attend through policies that
establish magnet schools, open enrollment, charter schools, tax
credits, and vouchers.  Research on this whole range of options
continues.25  Many families and communities are encouraged by
the experiences of their children with these options, particularly
in urban neighborhoods.  Increasing school options appeals to
the idea that parents and students can choose among schools
and to the belief that competition among schools improves
educational quality.  It also recognizes that there are diverse
ways to educate young people.  Others argue that some of these
options will increase racial segregation, weaken public schools,
benefit principally the privileged sectors of society, and leave too
many students in poor-performing schools.  The effects of each
of these policies—or proposed policies—need to be evaluated in
the local context with a special focus on whether or not the
option improves educational quality and offers greater opportu-
nities for children and youth living in poverty.  ELCA members
considering these choice options are encouraged to study the
ELCA’s 2001 social policy resolution on school voucher propos-
als26 as well as to use the questions listed above under “Evaluat-
ing Education Reforms.”27
Accountability
Public schools should be held accountable for educating all their
students, but how to do so is a source of ongoing contention.
While increased funds by them-
selves do not ensure better
educational results, their strategic
investment can make a differ-
ence.23  Moreover, equity in
funding among school districts is
a matter of justice.
34
A Social Statement
What should the standards be?  Who should set them?  What is
their impact on student learning?  What should be the conse-
quences for schools that fail to meet them?  What policies and
funding exist to improve schools that do not reach standards?
Intended to spur academic achievement, federal and state
legislation holds public schools accountable by means of stan-
dards and regular testing and by requiring change in low-
performing schools.  The effects of such laws require continuing
assessment.  Policies to implement accountability, therefore,
should address the whole education agenda, including to:
· provide for appropriate periodic adjustment in outcome
goals;
· evaluate academic progress with both qualitative and
quantitative measures;
· take into account the individual situation of students,
especially those who are negatively affected by language,
disabilities, or social disadvantages;
· provide, where indicated, adequate resources to implement
remediation and improve the quality of education in the
schools where students attend;
· offer, as a last resort, adequate alternatives for students
attending schools that consistently do not meet
performance standards; and
· give careful and comprehensive assessment to measure the
impact on student learning.
Improving Educational Quality
In addition to the above-mentioned reforms, efforts to improve
educational quality focus on every other aspect of public
schools.  Proposals include:
· changing who controls public schools;
· restructuring school administration and organization;
· creating smaller schools in urban areas or consolidating
smaller schools in rural areas;
· reducing class size;
· extending school calendars or school hours;
· improving teacher and administrator education and
development;
· introducing merit pay;
35
Our Calling in Education
· improving teaching methods and classroom environments;
and
· changing curricula.
Whether or not these reform proposals will improve education
may vary from one context to another.  In each context citizens
must ask the basic questions suggested above under “Evaluating
Education Reforms.”
Counsel to Parents
In some circumstances parents may be able to choose from
among a number of options to meet the educational needs of
their children, including public, magnet, private, charter, reli-
gious schools, and home schooling.  In these cases we urge
parents to be aware of the options and to consider:
· the special needs and gifts of their child;
· whether or not they desire a faith-based education for their
child;
· how well each option will achieve the purposes of
education (see page 22);
· how well the options prepare the student for life with and
for service to others in a complex, diverse, global society;
and
· the affordability of each option.
Because education is a shared responsibility, the ELCA encour-
ages parents to consult with others who may be of assistance in
making their decision.
4. Will Our Church Have Schools and
Colleges?  Will Our Schools and Colleges Have
a Church?
The Commitment to Lutheran Educational Institutions
36
A Social Statement
In a living tradition devoted to educating in the faith for voca-
tion in the Church and world, it is not surprising to find that
institutions of learning and teaching have been integral and
vital to its life and mission.  “When schools flourish,” Luther
was recorded as saying, “then things go well and the church is
secure.  Let us have learned citizens and teachers.  The youth
furnish recruits for the church; they are the source of its well-
being.  If there were no schools, who would there be to take our
place when we die?  In the church we are forced to have
schools.  God has preserved the church through schools; they
are its conservatories.”28  Since the Reformation, Lutherans have
taken on the demanding task of establishing and maintaining
educational institutions in hope and commitment to equip a
new generation to witness to the gospel and carry out their
vocation in society.
A steward of this tradition, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America has an extensive network of educational institutions to
benefit Church and society.  In 2006, ELCA congregations
owned and operated 267 elementary schools, 18 high schools,
and 1722 early childhood centers, involving more than 225,000
students.29  Twenty-eight colleges and universities are affiliated
with this church, which enrolled nearly 58,000 students in
2007.30  There are eight ELCA seminaries, and dozens of centers
and programs for continuing education.31  Under the auspices
of the three seminary clusters, other educational programs and
institutions of the ELCA are joining as interdependent lifelong
learning partners with the seminaries to expand access to
lifelong learning in the faith for all the baptized by building a
theological education network.  The ELCA’s Study of Theologi-
cal Education, adopted by the Churchwide Assembly in 1995,
guides the building of this new network.32
What are the ELCA’s hopes for and commitment to the future
of its schools (early childhood education centers through high
school), colleges, and universities?  All are highly prized by the
constituencies that directly support and benefit from them, yet
they are too often not well known or appreciated by many
ELCA members.  For the most part all must find their own
financial support.  Yet we face an opportune moment. The
number of schools is growing, and many colleges and universi-
37
Our Calling in Education
ties are reclaiming their
Lutheran connections.  This
situation provokes the ques-
tion: Will our schools and
colleges and universities have
a church—laity, pastors,
bishops, congregations, syn-
ods, seminaries, and churchwide organization—that affirms
and supports them?
This church’s fervent hope is that it be so.  We affirm anew our
historic commitment to Lutheran schools and colleges and
universities and encourage its deepening and extension.  If we
follow through on this commitment, then, yes, this church will
have vibrant schools and colleges and universities, benefitting
both Church and society and valued as indispensable educa-
tional arms of this church’s mission.
Lutheran Schools and Centers
ELCA congregations are becoming increasingly involved in
offering preschool, elementary, and secondary education to
their surrounding neighborhoods.  From 1995 to 2006 the
number of schools and centers grew by 15 percent, and many
congregations continue to express interest in beginning a school
or center.33  This remarkable development means that today
nearly one of every five ELCA congregations operates some type
of school.
Through their schools and centers, congregations aim to offer a
strong academic education in a caring Christian environment.
By word and example, teachers, administrators, and pastors
seek to motivate students to learn and nurture their gifts in
service to others in response to God’s love for them.  Students
learn in a setting where they pray, sing, and worship, and
where they study the Bible, the Church’s beliefs, and Christian
moral teachings.  Families who send their children to Lutheran
schools and centers take on an extra financial burden.  Often
families desire that their children be firmly educated in the faith
to prepare them for engaging aspects of a culture that they
We affirm anew our historic
commitment to Lutheran schools
and colleges and universities and
encourage its deepening and
extension.
38
A Social Statement
perceive to be indifferent to or in conflict with the Christian
faith.
Lutheran schools and centers enroll students of different reli-
gious, ethnic, cultural, and economic backgrounds.  At least 17
percent of children who attended Lutheran schools in 2005
were people of color other than white, a percentage more than
five times higher than ELCA congregations as a whole.34  Stu-
dents and teachers are especially diverse in urban settings.
Through the care and witness of faculty, staff, pastor, and
congregational members, Lutheran schools and centers offer
students and their families opportunity to hear the gospel and, if
desired, to become part of the congregation.  In so doing they
have proven to be a significant means of evangelizing un-
churched families.  They also have been important in educating
many children who later became leaders in this church and in
society.
Lutheran schools and centers
face many challenges in
offering excellent education
in a caring Christian environ-
ment.  They work, for ex-
ample, to maintain low
tuition while providing fair and adequate salaries for their
staffs, to find rightly qualified teachers and administrators, and
to develop a wholesome relationship between congregation and
school and center.  Schools and centers serving the poorest
neighborhoods are often the most fragile, under-resourced, and
in need of the most improvement.
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America view
Lutheran centers and schools as a significant part of this
church’s mission; commend congregations that sponsor them;
and honor the teachers, administrators, staff, and pastors who
work in them.  Wherever they exist, Lutheran schools and
centers should be an integral part of a congregation’s witness to
the gospel and public service to the community.  Congregations
should fulfill their responsibility to provide oversight, support,
and direction for their educational institutions.
Wherever they exist, Lutheran
schools and centers should be an
integral part of a congregation’s
witness to the gospel and public
service to the community.
39
Our Calling in Education
Expectations of Lutheran Centers and Schools
The ELCA expects our early childhood education centers and
schools to continue serving this church’s mission by:
· promoting academic excellence in age-appropriate ways
according to accepted standards;
· reaching out to others with the good news of Jesus Christ;
· educating in the faith for vocation; and
· serving their community.
Lutheran schools and centers will offer a secure, welcoming,
and caring learning environment for children of all cultural,
ethnic, religious, and economic backgrounds, and special needs.
As they are able, Lutheran schools (sometimes in cooperation
with public schools) are expected to make provision for students
with special learning needs.  They will provide scholarships for
low-income students and involve families in their children’s
education.  Lutheran schools and centers will offer service
education and prepare students to be responsible citizens and
productive members of society.  They will work in partnership
with other schools in their community.
Expectations of this Church
In order to provide a more supportive climate for enacting this
vision, the ELCA calls for renewed efforts to assist schools and
centers in areas that include:
· expecting churchwide and synodical leadership and ELCA
publications to promote Lutheran centers and schools;
· encouraging members to consider sending their children to
Lutheran centers and schools;
· preparing pastors, associates in ministry, deaconesses, and
diaconal ministers for service in congregations with centers
and schools;
· encouraging our seminaries, colleges, and universities to
prepare teachers, principals, pastors, and other staff for
Lutheran centers and schools both in their degree
programs and through in-service training;
· encouraging alliances for financial support for struggling
centers and schools, such as pairing congregations in
affluent areas with congregations in low-income areas;
40
A Social Statement
· providing seed money to ensure that Lutheran centers and
schools have a good foundation in areas of defining
purpose, education, faith formation, governance,
administration, and finance;
· strengthening the network among Lutheran schools to
meet common opportunities and needs; and
· disseminating information on and ensuring equity in public
funding for all children as laws require and the United
States Constitution permits.
Lutheran Colleges and Universities
A Tradition of Academic Excellence and Service
“A Christian cobbler makes good shoes, not poor shoes with
little crosses on them,” Luther was reported to have said.35
Likewise, Lutherans, out of commitment to the common good,
have insisted that their colleges and universities have a first duty
to be excellent schools.  This has been and continues to be the
case.  Following the example of Luther’s and Philip
Melanchthon’s leadership at the time of the Reformation,
Lutheran colleges and universities have conceived of education
in holistic terms and shaped their academic programs in the
liberal arts tradition.  Today they appear regularly in lists of the
best regional and national colleges.
ELCA colleges and universities perform valuable service to
Church and society.  At their best, they offer an excellent cur-
riculum that aims at educating the whole person.  Their empha-
sis on broad and integrated learning and critical thinking equips
students for a whole life.  Within this liberal arts context they
prepare students for professions in education, health care,
science, technology, social work, the arts, business, law, and
other specific callings, and they provide many future pastors
and other future leaders in this church with a well-rounded
education.
Furthermore, ELCA colleges and universities find excellent ways
to introduce their students to the essential questions of meaning
and purpose.  Many prominently feature the Lutheran teaching
41
Our Calling in Education
on vocation—that the pur-
pose of life is to serve God
and the neighbor in one’s
callings in everyday life.
More specifically, many
ELCA colleges and universi-
ties also educate students in
the faith by offering—and often requiring—courses in Bible,
theology, church history, and ethics.  They help students engage
the intellectual claims of the faith with the claims of other
disciplines.36  They sustain strong programs of service to the
neighbor in both local and global settings.  They offer opportuni-
ties for worship, Bible study, mentoring, and participation in
strong music programs that praise God.  When they take their
heritage seriously, they impart a vision of the world in which
Christian faith plays the central integrating role.  Graduates
testify and a comprehensive national survey confirms that
Lutheran colleges and universities have a positive and lasting
impact on students in matters related to academic quality, faith,
ethics, civic engagement, and church affiliation and leader-
ship.37
The Changing Context
In the history of higher education in the United States, many
church-founded institutions of higher learning have disengaged
from their sponsoring churches—some totally, some partially.
Nearly all church-related colleges have experienced some mea-
sure of disengagement from both the institutional church and
from the religious heritage that once influenced nearly every
facet of the college’s life.  ELCA colleges and universities repre-
sent a broad range on the spectrum of engagement.  Most have
maintained a significant connection with their Lutheran heri-
tage, and many are giving renewed attention to their Christian
identity in a world of many faiths and cultures.
ELCA colleges and universities persist in their mission as
church-related colleges in the midst of a sharply changing
environment that brings both opportunity and challenge.  The
major opportunity is that they will continue to be excellent
ELCA colleges and universities
find excellent ways to introduce
their students to the essential
questions of meaning and pur-
pose.
42
A Social Statement
schools that bring the Lutheran voice to bear in an increasingly
global, ecumenical, diverse, and competitive educational scene.
This church’s colleges and universities can continue to embody
in a vastly new environment a persuasive vision of Christian
higher education that is embedded in the Lutheran tradition.
Especially encouraging are the vigorous global outreach pro-
grams on many campuses, the affirmation of Lutheran distinc-
tiveness in a changing and sometimes hostile culture, and the
growing cultural and ethnic diversity in many settings.  Among
the challenges are that our colleges and universities might lose
their connection with the Christian heritage completely, that
they may lose their academic vitality due to inadequate re-
sources, that their costs might exceed the financial resources of
most Lutherans, or that they may not achieve the diversity they
seek.
Life in Relationship
A strong and vibrant relationship between this church and its
institutions of higher learning assumes mutual commitments.  In
shaping the future of that relationship, this church may ask
whether or not its colleges and universities are authentically and
recognizably Christian in the Lutheran tradition, urging them to
manifest that identity.  Conversely, colleges and universities that
are faithful to their Christian character may ask whether or not
this church vigorously supports them: Will congregations en-
courage students to consider an ELCA college or university?
Will pastors and bishops promote them?  Will ELCA high school
graduates attend our colleges and universities?  In these matters
the ELCA will need to manifest its commitment to its colleges
and universities.
Due to shrinking resources and competing priorities, there has
been a forty-year decline in churchwide and synodical financial
support for colleges and universities.  The ELCA is grateful that
Lutheran colleges and universities have developed alternative
sources of financial support, and many individual Lutherans are
generous and faithful benefactors.  It has provided advocacy
and support, maintained a strong network among college
leaders, provided leadership development opportunities for
43
Our Calling in Education
faculty and staff, nurtured the conversation between faith and
learning, and provided valuable research to assist the colleges
and universities in their mission.  Fortress Press, the academic
arm of this church’s publishing ministry, continues to publish
texts in biblical studies, theology, ethics, and pastoral care that
are used widely in ELCA colleges and universities as well as in
this church’s seminaries.
In the future as in the past, the survival and flourishing of
ELCA colleges and universities will depend on a delicate ecol-
ogy of school, church, and family.  Where the colleges and
universities live out their calling as significant ventures in
Lutheran education, congregations and families demonstrate
interest and confidence in those institutions.  Without the
congregations and families that give important support to
Lutheran ventures in education, the colleges and universities
may re-define themselves and their missions for people who will
support them.  The ecology that once made Lutheran colleges,
congregations, and families a viable interdependent organism
must be shaped in ways that respond to these new realities and
opportunities.
The ELCA, therefore, urges its colleges and universities and this
church in all its expressions to maintain their connections where
they are strong, strengthen them where they are weak, and
rebuild them where they are lacking.  It calls for mutually
beneficial relationships built on trust, commitment, and collabo-
ration.
Expectations of ELCA Colleges and Universities
In such a relationship the ELCA expects that its colleges and
universities will:
· reaffirm their commitment to maintain a living connection
with the Christian faith;
· offer excellent, broad education in service to Church and
society in a setting of academic freedom;
· educate in the faith with courses in Bible, Lutheran
theology, church history, and ethics;
44
A Social Statement
· serve as incubators for the discovery of knowledge, pre-
serve it in scholarly collections, and communicate it
through scholarly publications;
· nurture an ongoing dialogue between the claims of the
Christian faith and the claims of the many academic
disciplines as well as explore issues at the crossroads of life;
· feature prominently the Lutheran teaching on vocation;
· embody important elements—worship, music and the arts,
service, personal moral standards, international
education—as part of the ongoing Lutheran ethos;
· maintain programs that serve as a liaison between the
college or university and the various expressions of this
church;
· make adequate provision to meet the needs of students
with disabilities; and
· continue to attempt to make it financially possible for
qualified students—especially Lutheran students—who
desire to attend a Lutheran college or university to do so.
Expectations of this Church
To make the relationship a mutual one, this church also expects
that:
· the presiding bishop and synodical bishops will voice
persistently and persuasively their commitment to our
colleges and universities;
· the churchwide organization will demonstrate persistently
and persuasively its commitment to this church’s colleges
and universities;
· the churchwide organization will continue its consultative
and informative roles with ELCA colleges and universities
and foster contact and collaboration among them;
· synods will support colleges and universities on their
territory in intentional and visible ways;
· colleges and universities, seminaries, synods, schools, and
other ELCA institutions and ministries will initiate and
welcome partnerships with one another;
· congregations will support colleges in helping them recruit
students and in aiding students financially who attend
ELCA colleges and universities;
45
Our Calling in Education
· ELCA youth and their parents will give careful
consideration to Lutheran colleges and universities; and
· advocacy ministries will call on lawmakers to find means
of public support for students to attend private and
religious colleges and universities and urge lawmakers in
those states that make grants to students going to private
colleges to maintain them at the highest level possible.
This church individually and corporately should give its schools,
colleges, and universities its full loyalty and support so that they
faithfully and competently exercise their calling in education.
Supporting Lifelong Learning
Education is a lifelong process and takes a variety of forms,
involving non-formal learning experiences as well as each
person’s own more formal discipline and study.  This ongoing
learning may occur in museums, art galleries, planetariums,
aquariums, theaters, concert halls, zoos, botanical gardens,
nature preserves, book clubs, travel programs, and lecture series.
We of the ELCA value and support these non-formal institu-
tions and activities.  We also affirm the more formal role of
public universities, colleges, and other educational institutions in
providing a broad range of extension and continuing education
programs that serve an increasingly diverse adult population.
We welcome the opportunities for learning provided by new
forms of electronic communication.
Just as many congregations offer quality educational experi-
ences for people of all ages to continue to grow in their faith,
our Lutheran colleges and universities, seminaries, lifelong
learning partners, and outdoor ministries also offer opportuni-
ties for lifelong learning in knowledge of the faith as well as in
knowledge of the world.  The ELCA commends Lutheran
colleges and universities for expanding their academic programs
to serve the needs of non-traditional students for both graduate
and undergraduate studies.  We also commend our seminaries
and other study centers of this church for responding to the
learning needs of both lay and rostered leaders in congregations
as well as to the desire of adults of all ages for personal growth
in faith and knowledge through lifelong learning.
46
A Social Statement
We urge the churchwide organization to continue to provide
leadership and support to the institutions and agencies of the
church that provide these essential educational services and to
encourage them to deepen their interdependent partnership in a
network that educates for vocation.  In order that lifelong
learning be encouraged and well-resourced, the full range of
teaching institutions and programs in this church should con-
tinue their progress toward fulfillment of the vision of the
ELCA’s Study of Theological Education, deepening their emerg-
ing partnerships with the three seminary clusters to form an
interdependent network of education providers throughout this
church.  Only such a network for lifelong learning is adequate
both to our calling in education and the callings of all learners.
5. Will Public Higher Education Serve the
Common Good?
Expectations for Public Universities and Colleges
Higher education in the United States embraces a broad range
of religious, private, and public colleges and universities.  These
academic institutions vary in their philosophy of education,
history, culture, quality, specialties, cost, size, and status.  This
variety gives vitality to higher education, making it one of our
country’s strongest assets.
Public institutions are the most numerous institutions of higher
education and serve the most students.  Public four-year colleges
and universities, public community colleges, and technical
colleges provide the primary access point to higher education
for millions of people of all economic classes and every racial
and ethnic group, including thousands of international stu-
dents.  As public institutions, we as citizens share responsibility
for them.  Their future is vital to the common good, which we
are to serve and promote as part of our vocation.
Institutions providing technical education make important
contributions to the common good by preparing skilled profes-
47
Our Calling in Education
sionals for careers in a wide range of trades and professions.
Individuals prepared for these occupations are enabled to make
their way in society and to serve their neighbors in practical
ways.
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America look to all
colleges and universities to transmit knowledge through teach-
ing, advance knowledge through research, preserve knowledge
in scholarly collections, and communicate knowledge through
publications.38  They thereby contribute to the common good by
connecting their knowledge to the world in which we live.
Public universities and colleges do these things across a wide
spectrum of disciplines.  They teach undergraduate students the
humanities, arts, languages, and sciences; and their post-gradu-
ate programs educate professors and other professions such as
doctors, lawyers, and scientists.  Public universities along with
many private universities are centers of basic scientific research
and technological development.  Their libraries and Internet
resources make vast learning available, and publications by their
professors profoundly influence our culture.  They also sponsor
continuing education for adults who have concluded formal
degree programs but wish to continue learning throughout their
lives.
The Commitment to Public Higher Education
Lutherans have long had a
commitment to public higher
education.  The ELCA is
grateful for the role public
universities and colleges play
in preparing people—includ-
ing most Lutherans who attend college—to act competently in
their callings and responsibilities.  Because knowledge of how
the world functions and learning how to learn continue to
benefit both individuals and society, we encourage vigorous
public support for the many institutions of higher learning.  As
society’s expectation increases about how many years of school-
ing people should have, the importance of public universities
and colleges also increases.
The ELCA is grateful for the role
public universities play in preparing
people to act competently in their
callings and responsibilities.
48
A Social Statement
The ELCA honors and supports the broad network of commu-
nity and technical colleges and their students, faculties, and
staffs.  These institutions of higher education provide strategic
opportunities for many students who wish to continue their
education and obtain training in sought-for practical skills.  In
addition to preparing students for their careers, these educa-
tional institutions often invigorate the economies of their com-
munities.
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America expects all univer-
sities and colleges to be places of free inquiry that exhibit intel-
lectual honesty, the disciplined search for knowledge and truth,
and civility.  We support the academic freedom of public higher
education and oppose its restriction for ideological or political
reasons.  We expect that the diversity of perspectives among
professors will enable public universities and colleges to be
settings for genuine dialog on the major ideas and values that
shape, and often create controversy in, our society.
Universities and colleges are charged to engage in ongoing
discussion about what counts as knowledge in contrast to
ignorance and misunderstanding.  The boundaries and shape of
this discussion change as new discoveries are made.  This has
led to new areas of inquiry such as the history of religion.  It also
has led to the study of peoples and cultures that may have been
ignored or excluded in the past.  This church challenges and
encourages public universities and colleges to take up the full
range of religious traditions and their intellectual content as
legitimate participants in their search for knowledge and truth.
The extraordinary growth of higher education since World War
II is closely tied to the increased emphasis it gives to occupa-
tional education.39  College and university education has be-
come the principal—almost exclusive—way for people to gain
access to higher earnings and occupational or professional
status.  Most students today look to their college education
chiefly as a means for them to become well-off financially.40  The
danger is that occupational purposes will overwhelm moral,
civic, and intellectual goals.
49
Our Calling in Education
Concern for the purpose of life, justice and neighbor, and the
common good are central to nearly all religions and intrinsic to
our civic values.  We, therefore, commend and encourage
renewal of disciplines in which these matters are examined,
such as the humanities, the arts, and the social sciences.  We
commend efforts in higher education to engage students in
service learning, and we applaud student-led groups that
struggle with questions of life’s purpose and society’s good.  On
campuses where many students ask such questions,41 Lutheran
campus ministry takes on special significance.
This Church’s Presence and Campus Ministry
The ELCA is present in public universities and colleges, as well
as private ones, through students, professors, administrators,
and staff living out their calling in these institutions.  More
Lutherans teach at public and non-Lutheran private universities
and colleges than do at Lutheran institutions.  Many of them
not only perform their callings with excellence but also provide
models of Christian teaching and the engagement of faith and
learning.  All have opportunities to witness to their faith.  We
celebrate those who carry on these tasks and encourage this
church to support them.
Lutheran Campus Ministry
This church also is present in these institutions of learning
through campus ministries.  Lutherans launched their first foray
into intentional ministry on public campuses in 1907 at the
University of Wisconsin–Madison Campus.  A century later
there are nearly 200 recognized ELCA campus ministries that
receive churchwide and/or synodical annual operating grants.
In addition, more than 400 Cooperating Congregations in
Campus Ministry carry on some form of outreach to a nearby
campus.42  In some places, this ministry is ecumenical and
carried on in partnership with other denominations.
Today, campus ministries face the challenge of both nurturing
Lutheran students and reaching out to seekers.  Campus minis-
tries sometimes face the tension of addressing controversial
50
A Social Statement
issues on campus while being
communities that welcome
individuals with different
viewpoints.  While some
students may consider a
certain attitude as prophetic,
others who disagree may feel
unwelcome, perceiving that
promoting the issue has come
to define the ministry more than the gospel that unites them.
Limited resources may often mean campus ministries are unable
to meet the diverse expectations and opportunities presented to
them.
Campus ministry in this church “invites people in academic
settings more deeply into Jesus Christ and the community that
bears his name, so that they discover and fulfill their vocation as
disciples.”43 This ministry gives young adults on campus oppor-
tunity to participate in the life of the Church and deepen their
faith during an important time of their lives when they are
experiencing change, growth, and challenge.
Expectations of Campus Ministry
Lutheran campus ministry is an integral part of our calling in
education.  Many former students testify to ways in which
campus ministry helped them grow in their understanding of
their faith and vocation as they gained new knowledge.  As it
has done for decades, this ministry continues to provide leaders
for Church and society.  The ELCA expects its campus minis-
tries to:
· be worshiping communities that proclaim the gospel and
celebrate the sacraments;
· educate in the faith, teaching the Bible and Christian
doctrine, exploring Christian perspectives on ultimate
questions, and creating settings for students, staff, and
professors to ask questions and to discuss their concerns;
· call students to live out their baptismal vocation,
challenging them to regard their learning itself as a worthy
calling and providing them with theological wisdom to

accompany their growing learning and technical
competence;
· engage faith and learning, showing how faith and its
knowledge deepen and enliven learning in the classroom,
library, and laboratory and how that learning deepens and
enlivens faith and its knowledge;
· model thoughtful and respectful dialogue on controversial
issues;
· provide opportunities for service in Church and society;
and
· offer opportunities for friendships, fun, and community
life.
Expectations of this Church
Lack of financial support threatens campus ministries in many
places.  Most depend almost entirely on funds from outside
sources, primarily from synods and the churchwide organiza-
tion, which have been in a forty-year decline.  Let us be fully
aware of the growing crisis in this church’s ministry to a large,
influential segment of young adults living and studying at
public (and private) universities and colleges.  In reaffirming its
ministry on these campuses, the ELCA calls for creative action
to support campus ministry that takes into account opportuni-
ties, challenges, and resource constraints.  This action includes:
· calling upon the presiding bishop, synodical bishops,
pastors, and other leaders to support this church’s campus
ministry;
· urging congregations to alert their students on non-
Lutheran campuses about Lutheran campus ministry;
· encouraging congregations near colleges and universities to
reach out to professors, students, and staff of these
institutions; and
· thinking in new ways about how we establish and
maintain campus ministries which may involve new
models of ministry, of partnership, and of staffing and
support.
52
A Social Statement
Will Students Have Access to Higher Education?
Higher education in the United States has long been seen as the
portal of opportunity to upward mobility and the realization of
the American dream.  Following World War II, the GI Bill
provided educational opportunity for millions of veterans and
fueled a vigorous postwar economy and a growing middle class.
Higher education, then and now, enables individuals to tran-
scend the boundaries of class and race and contributes to the
economic and civic well-being of the nation.
The high cost borne by students and their families, however, is
limiting access to higher education, depriving many individuals
of opportunity and depriving society of highly educated citi-
zens.  The cost of higher education has grown substantially in
recent years, significantly outpacing inflation in the rest of the
economy.  This cost is funded from four sources:
· tuition paid by students and their families;
· charitable contributions of individuals, corporations, and
foundations;
· financial assistance in the form of grants, loans, and work;
and
· in the case of public education, direct appropriations from
state or local government.
In recent years financial assistance and direct appropriations
have declined in relationship to the growth in the cost of educa-
tion, and charitable contributions have not made up the differ-
ence.  As a result, the burden upon students and their families
has grown.  This high and growing cost to students prevents
many, including people who live in poverty, from pursuing a
college degree.44
In spite of the general acknowledgment that educated citizens
are key to this country’s economic vitality and that more needs
to be done to provide equitable access for all, public investment
in higher education has been declining for some time relative to
its rising cost.  Funding for federal and state grants to students
lags behind increases in educational costs, and state subsidies to
public colleges and universities fail to keep pace with increased
costs.45  In addition, college- and university-funded aid has
53
Our Calling in Education
increased for middle- and
upper- income students at the
expense of students from low-
income families.46
The consequences of this
trend limit equitable access
and jeopardize academic
quality.  Specifically:
· Students are carrying increasingly larger debt loads and
requiring more time to complete their education.47
· While college completion rates have improved among all
income groups over the past thirty years, the gaps in
completion rates between students who are affluent and
those who are poor have increased.48
Although the growth of community colleges is a promising
development, lack of funding weakens our country’s leadership
in higher education and compromises our capacity to meet the
educational requirements of an increasingly knowledge-based
world.  Colleges and universities are being stretched thin in their
capacity to provide high-quality education, and, most impor-
tantly, equity in educational opportunity.
ELCA colleges and universities have responded to this situation
with a variety of scholarship and grant programs of their own,
several with considerable success, as seen in the relatively strong
enrollment of people of color and from low- and middle-income
families.  For most colleges and universities, however, it is
impossible to close the opportunity gap created by inadequate
state and federal funding for students’ financial aid.  As a
consequence, many low- and middle-income families find it
difficult—if possible—to access this church’s colleges, and the
colleges struggle to extend financial aid while maintaining
academic quality and financial viability.
In light of this situation, the ELCA calls upon its advocacy
ministry to support adequate funding for higher education to
increase equitable access, and urges members as citizens to
consider how public policy can improve equitable access to
Colleges and universities are being
stretched thin in their capacity to
provide high-quality education,
and, most importantly, equity in
educational opportunity.

A Social Statement
higher education.  The ELCA urges the following public policy
remedies:
· increase state and federal funds for need-based financial
assistance;
· support targeted incentive programs for low-income and
under-represented groups;
· increase state subsidies to public institutions as a way of
ameliorating tuition increases; and
· increase efficiency wherever feasible.
We also:
· urge ELCA colleges and universities to continue to seek
ways to help redress the growing opportunity gap;
· encourage members to help fund scholarships for low-
income students and congregations to provide scholarship
assistance to their students who attend ELCA colleges;
· affirm this church’s practice of providing financial
assistance to ELCA colleges and universities as a sign of
continuing commitment to them; and
· call upon the churchwide organization to work with
synods to expand scholarships for United States and
international students who need assistance.
Living Our Calling
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America give thanks
to God whose gracious gift of new life in baptism frees us for the
vocation to love our neighbor and contribute to the common
good in our places of responsibility in daily life.  We are grateful
that God, who has created humans with ability to learn, teach,
and know, blesses human life through education.  We pray that
the Holy Spirit will sustain, renew, and transform us as we live
our calling in education in this church and society with its many
amazing opportunities and daunting challenges.  May we in
this calling exhibit the character of our new life in Christ, to
which St.  Paul summons us: “Do not be conformed to this
world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so
that you may discern what is the will of God—what is good and
acceptable and perfect” (Romans 12:2).  May we faithfully and
boldly be a teaching and learning church, educating in the faith
55
Our Calling in Education
for vocation and striving with others so that all people have
equitable access to a high-quality education.

3 The quotations in the text are from the Apostles’ Creed, The Book of Concord,
21-22.  The social statement follows the Apostles’ Creed and Luther’s explana-
tions of this creed in his catechisms in connecting one of the persons of the
Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—with a particular work of God:
creation, redemption, and sanctification.  The Christian tradition also teaches
that the whole Trinity and all three persons of the Trinity in communion with
one another are agents of creation, redemption, and sanctification.
4 See “The Augsburg Confession,” Article XVI, for how the Lutheran confes-
sions affirm civil affairs and distinguish the justice and goodness of civil
affairs from “the eternal righteousness of the heart” transmitted by the
gospel.  The Book of Concord, 49.  In the “Apology to the Augsburg Confession,”
Philip Melanchthon speaks often of civil righteousness in distinction from the
righteousness before God given in the gospel.  “Civil righteousness that
reason understands” deals with “the commandments of the second table” of
the Ten Commandments.  Ibid., 125.

6 Church in Society: A Lutheran Perspective, the first ELCA social statement,
called on this church to be “a community of moral deliberation,” 5-6, 7-8.
That social statement was adopted by the 1991 Churchwide Assembly.  The
seven subsequent social statements adopted by the ELCA as well as the 11
messages adopted by the ELCA Church Council provide resources and
guidance on various societal topics that are often the subject of education in
this church.  This social statement assumes what these social statements and
messages say on topics related to education, such as economic justice, care for
creation, racism, and health care.  ELCA social statements and messages are

8 See Merton P. Strommen and Richard Hardel, Passing on the Faith: A Radical
New Model for Youth and Family Ministry (Winona, Minn.: St Mary’s Press, 2000),
14.  According to one survey of youth and adults cited in the book, for
example, “only 9 percent reported holding family devotions with any degree
of regularity.”
9 In studying the religious lives of teenagers, Christian Smith concludes that at
the level of consciousness, “adolescent religious and spiritual understanding
and concern seem to be generally very weak.  Most U.S. teens have a difficult
to impossible time explaining what they believe, what it means, and what the
implications of their beliefs are for their lives” (262).  Most Protestant teens in
effect discard the belief of salvation by grace and faith alone to voice the idea
that they are saved by living a morally good life (136).  Smith suggests that
the dominant religion among contemporary teens is what he calls “Moralistic
Therapeutic Deism” (162ff).  Christian Smith with Melinda Lundquist Denton,

Oxford Press, 2005).
10 In the liturgy for Holy Baptism, parents and sponsors pledge that they will
“faithfully bring [their children] to the services of God’s house, and teach
them the Lord’s Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments.  As they
grow in years, you should place in their hands the Holy Scriptures and
provide for their instruction in the Christian faith, that, living in the covenant
of their Baptism and in communion with the Church, they may lead godly
lives until the day of Jesus Christ.” Lutheran Book of Worship (Minneapolis:
Augsburg Publishing House, 1978), 121.

16 We reaffirm the position of the social statements of the Lutheran Church in
America and The American Lutheran Church that supported the U.S. Supreme
Court’s decisions in 1962 and 1963 declaring it unconstitutional for states to
require religious exercises in public schools and permitting public schools to
teach about religion.  See Prayer and Bible Reading in the Public Schools, social
statement of the Lutheran Church in America (1964), and Church-State Relations

Our Calling in Education
17 The Web site of The First Amendment Center (www.fac.org/rel_liberty/
publicschools/Index.aspx) provides helpful resources on religious liberty in
public schools.  It includes the important consensus document developed by
individuals representing very different views, “Public Schools and Religious
Communities.”
18 For those who argue that public schools are doing well compared to other
countries, see Gerald W. Bracey, The War Against America’s Public Schools:
Privatizing Schools, Commercializing Education (Needham Heights, Mass.: Allyn
and Bacon, 2002) and Bruce J. Biddle and Lawrence J. Saha, The Untested
Accusation: Principals, Research Knowledge, and Policy Making in Schools
(Westport, Conn.: Ablex Publishing, 2002).  Those who do not think that
public schools are meeting today’s challenges argue: “Having reviewed trends
in the United States and abroad, the committee is deeply concerned that the
scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are
eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength.”  Rising
Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter
Economic Future, Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy, created by
the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and
Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, “Executive Summary” (2005),
4 (www.nap.edu/execsumm_pdf/11463.pdf).  Among the “worrisome indicators”
the committee noted are: “US 12th graders recently performed below the
international average for 21 countries on a test of general knowledge in
mathematics and science.”  And “In 1999, only 41% of US 8th grade students
received instruction from a mathematics teacher who specialized in math-
ematics, considerably lower than the international average of 71%.”
19 “One-sixth of the country’s black students now attend virtually all non-
white schools, many of which are impoverished, and only one-seventh of the
whites attend multiracial schools, defined as those with 10 percent or more
minority enrollment.”  David K. Shipler, The Working Poor: Invisible in America
(New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2004), 294.
20 For example, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics’
publication “Dropout Rates in the United States: 2001”: “In 2001, students
living in low-income families were six times more likely than their peers in
high-income families to drop out of high school over the one-year period of
October 2000 to 2001 (table 1).  (Low income is defined as the lowest 20
percent of all family incomes, while high income refers to the top 20 percent
of income distribution.)”  While the national dropout rate from high school is
10.7 percent, more than 25 percent of young people in virtually every large
city leave high school without graduating (www.nces.ed.gov/pubs2005/drop-
out2001).
21 A new study, Funding Gaps 2006, documents how school financial policy at
the federal, state, and district levels systematically stacks the decks against
schools that serve low-income students and students of color.  The study was
prepared by The Education Trust (www2.edtrust.org).

www.elca.org/socialpolicyresolutions/resolution.asp?id=83&ref=hts.
27 In its Churchwide Assembly in 2001, the ELCA adopted a social policy
resolution on school vouchers.  This resolution neither favors nor opposes all
voucher proposals, but sets out a number of goals by which to evaluate
specific legislative proposals.  These goals, set forth as questions, ask to what
degree proposals:
· provide public schools the support and resources necessary
to fulfill their tasks?
· increase equal access to high-quality education for all,
especially for children and youth who live in poverty or are
otherwise disadvantaged?
· enhance the ability of families—especially families living in
poverty and other situations of hardship—to select the
right high-quality education for their children?
· allow participating schools, including religious ones, to
maintain their distinctive character and mission?
· protect against all forms of invidious discrimination against
students?
· ensure just, equitable, and long-term viable sources of funding?
· provide eligible families sufficient and accurate information
of students in participating schools?
· ensure ways for measuring the educational achievements
of students in participating schools?
· establish means to evaluate the positive and negative results of the
program and in light of these results to consider if the program should
be continued, modified, or ended?

37 A recent survey compared a large sample of Lutheran graduates from
Lutheran colleges and universities and from public flagship universities on a
number of key issues.  Compared to Lutheran alumni of flagship public
universities, for example, Lutheran alumni of Lutheran colleges and universi-
ties:
· said their colleges placed more emphasis on personal values and ethics
60
A Social Statement
(90 percent to 41 percent);
· discovered more opportunities to develop spiritually (87 percent to
20 percent);
· experienced more help in integrating faith into other aspects of life (72
percent to 11 percent);
· were more likely to have been engaged in church or religious activities
(74 percent to 31 percent);
· felt there was a greater sense of community among students (88 percent
to 57 percent);
· found more faculty who were interested in students personally and
academically (85 percent to 41 percent);
· reported that their colleges were more effective in developing moral
principles for careers and leadership (90 percent to 36 percent); and
· were more likely to be “completely satisfied” with the quality of
education they received (59 percent to 35 percent).
The survey was done under the auspices of the Lutheran Education Conference
of North America in 2005 (www.lutherancolleges.org).  The alumni who were
surveyed had graduated between 1991-1999.

University Press, 1992), 16-17.
39 “In 1900 only 2.3 percent of those aged eighteen to twenty-four went to
college; in 2000, 36 percent of this group attended college.  In 1940, only 4.5
percent of the entire population had completed four years of college; by the
end of the century it was 25.2 percent” (56).  About two-thirds of graduating
students in 2000 received their college degrees in occupational or professional
fields (57).  The authors argue for the following point: “As higher education
became a mass institution by exalting its public purposes—its benefits to the
nation’s economy, the protection of national defense, the creation of new
knowledge, and the promise of equal educational opportunity—its private
benefits in helping individuals gain access to professional status and earnings
became its dominant rationale” (56).  They claim that “the ethos of a moral
and civic purpose to higher education has never disappeared, but it has
become a minority view in the world of scholarly research and in the voca-
tional preparation of students” (61).  W. Norton Grubb and Marvin Lazerson,
The Education Gospel: The Economic Power of Schooling (Cambridge, Massachu-
setts: Harvard University Press, 2004).
40 “While the post-World War II expansion drew on a rhetoric of public
purposes, students attended college because of the possibilities for individual
gain.  One measure of advancing vocationalism was the attitude of students,
reflected in an annual survey of freshmen.  In the late 1960s, developing a
meaningful philosophy of life was the most important goal of freshmen, rated
‘essential’ or ‘very important’ by 80 percent of respondents, while fewer than
45 percent thought it important to be well-off financially.  At the end of the
century these two values had traded places: developing a meaningful philoso-
phy was most important for only 42 percent of freshmen, while 74 percent
cited being well-off financially.” Ibid., 65.

Students’ Search for Meaning and Purpose,” Higher Education Research

Institute (Graduate School of Education & Information Studies, University of
California, Los Angeles, 2005).  This extensive survey of first-year students at
colleges and universities across the country found high levels of interest in
spiritual and religious questions.  For example, more than three-fourths of
students say that they are “searching for meaning/purpose in life.” Pages 4-5.
While this report seems to differ from the one referred to in the previous
endnote, it may indicate the complexity of contemporary students, or perhaps
differences in methodologies between the two studies.

44 “Pervasively dismal grades in affordability show that for most American
families college is less affordable now than it was a decade ago.  The rising
cost of attending college has outpaced the growth of family income.  Although
financial aid has increased, it has not kept pace with the cost of attendance.
Every state should reexamine college tuition and financial aid policies, and
each should formally link future tuition increases to gains in family income.
In the meantime, the conclusion from Measuring Up 2004 is clear: The vast
majority of states have failed to keep college affordable for most families” (8).
“The nation’s gap in college participation between affluent and poor students
has widened.  The college-going gap between white, African-American, and
Latinos persists” (10).  Measuring Up 2004, The National Center for Public
Policy and Higher Education (2004), 8 (http://measuringup.highereducation.org/
_docs/2004/NationalReport_2004.pdf).  The report evaluates and grades the 50
states in their higher education performance in four categories: preparation,
participation, affordability, and completion.
45 The federal Higher Education Act of 1965 carried the hope and promise of
ensuring access to higher education for low- and middle-income students.  It
created the Pell grants, which enabled millions of students to receive a higher
education who would not otherwise have received one.  In addition, several
states initiated grant and scholarship programs with similar objectives.
Funding for these federal and state grants, however, has fallen behind
educational costs.  “For example, in 1975 the average Pell grant covered 84%
of the cost of college and in 2006 it covers only 36% of the cost.” Kati Haycock,
“Promise Abandoned” (www2.edtrust.org).

47 National Conference on State Legislatures, Transforming Higher Education:
National Imperative—State Responsibility, 2006 (www.ncsl.org) documents both
the heavier debt load and the more time required to complete students’
education.
48 “For example, in 1975 40% of students in the top income quartile completed
college by age 24 compared to 6% of the lower quartile students.  By 2003 the
completion rates were 75% and 9% for the two groups” (Haycock).
