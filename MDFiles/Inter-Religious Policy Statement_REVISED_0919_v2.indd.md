A Declaration of Inter-Religious Commitment:
Action of the 2019 Churchwide Assembly, Aug. 8, 2019
To adopt the proposed policy statement “A Declaration of Inter-Religious Commitment: A policy statement of 
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.”
In favor – 890	 97.48%
Opposed – 23	 2.52%
Background
In 1991, the second Churchwide Assembly of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) adopted 
“A Declaration of Ecumenical Commitment: A policy statement of the Evangelical Lutheran Church 
in America,” which called for a “separate, official statement to describe [the ELCA’s] commitments and 
aspirations” in the area of inter-religious relations.
Twenty-five years later, in August 2016, Presiding Bishop Elizabeth Eaton appointed the Inter-Religious Task 
Force to carry out this mandate: Patricia J. Lull (chair), Kathryn Mary Lohre (staff), Katie Bringman Baxter, 
Jacqueline Bussie, Elizabeth A. Eaton, Rahuldeep Singh Gill, William Horne, Darrell H. Jodock, Carol Schersten 
LaHurd, Peg Schultz-Akerson, Mark Swanson, and Lamont Anthony Wells.
A first draft was developed by fall 2017. Input received from preliminary review with ecumenical and inter-
religious partners and other key leadership groups in 2017, as well as public review across the church in 2018, 
greatly informed the task force’s revisions. 
The final draft was presented to the ELCA Conference of Bishops in October 2018, and to the ELCA Church 
Council in November 2018. Strongly encouraged by the Conference of Bishops, the ELCA Church Council 
unanimously recommended the proposed policy statement for adoption by the 2019 Churchwide Assembly. 
“A Declaration of Ecumenical Commitment,” “A Declaration of the ELCA to the Jewish Community” (1994) and 
“A Declaration of Inter-Religious Commitment” together form the policy basis for the ecumenical and inter-
religious relations of the ELCA.

A Declaration of Inter-Religious Commitment:
A policy statement of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
FOREWORD: HISTORICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has been engaging in inter-religious relations since 
its formation in 1988, building upon the legacy of its predecessor bodies, the work of The Lutheran World 
Federation (LWF), and the witness of our ecumenical partners. 
As part of the global Lutheran communion, we wrestle with and lament Martin Luther’s troubling legacy 
regarding inter-religious relations, especially his anti-Judaic and anti-Islamic writings. Importantly, the first 
major inter-religious witness of this church was the adoption of a “Declaration of the ELCA to the Jewish 
Community” (1994), which repudiated Luther’s vile anti-Judaic diatribes and reached out in love and respect 
to the Jewish community.
Over the years, our inter-religious relations have deepened and expanded. As a church, we have developed 
educational resources, engaged in dialogue and common action, defended our neighbors against religious 
bigotry, and cared for our various partnerships. While we have focused on Jewish and Muslim relations, 
we have also participated in organizations and efforts that reflect the broader diversity of religions and 
worldviews in the United States and globally. 
Our 1991 policy statement, “A Declaration of Ecumenical Commitment,” called for “a separate, official 
statement” that would reflect the “distinct responsibility for the church to enter into conversations and reach 
deeper understanding with people of other faiths.” This inter-religious policy statement seeks to fulfill this 
recommendation, and complements our church’s ecumenical policy statement.
Whenever possible, the ELCA cooperates with other Christians in building relations with those of other 
religions and worldviews. Councils of churches are an important avenue of dialogue and common action. While 
not all Christians are interested in or supportive of inter-religious relations, this commitment is receiving 
increased attention in many churches. Our Christian companions have greatly enhanced our journey. In fact, 
the inter-religious statements of our ecumenical partners have informed the development of this document.
At the same time, the ELCA has something distinctive to say about our inter-religious commitments. As a 
policy statement, this document provides a common framework for the diverse ministries of this church. The 
12 commitments provide a succinct summary of the policy and may prove useful in certain contexts as a 
stand-alone aid. The afterword goes deeper into the biblical, confessional, and theological basis for the policy.
As used in this document, the word “religion” refers to various forms of beliefs and practices, such 
as Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism, Taoism, and traditional indigenous

spiritualities. Whenever “neighbor” is used, it refers to all those who profess a religion, as well as those 
who do not, including those who consider themselves atheists or agnostics or ascribe to other worldviews 
that are not explicitly religious. “We” refers to the individual members and participants, as well as to the 
congregations and ministries of the whole church. This document seeks to address a Lutheran approach to 
understanding and engaging with our neighbors in a multi-religious, pluralistic context.
As descriptions of the teachings of other religions and worldviews are readily available elsewhere, this policy 
statement does not seek to explain or categorize them. Neither does it seek to provide a theology of world 
religions. Instead, its focus is on our dual calling to witness to Christ and to love our neighbor. As such, this 
document serves as an invitation to individuals, congregations, ministries, institutions, and expressions of the 
ELCA to engage constructively with our neighbors of other religions and worldviews. In this declaration, our 
neighbors may also find greater clarity about who we are, what they can expect of us, and why and how our 
Christian faith and Lutheran self-understanding compel us into dialogue and common action. 
In all of this, may greater understanding and cooperation throughout the Oikoumene – the whole inhabited 
earth – enhance the justice, peace, and life abundant that God intends for us all.
INTRODUCTION 
As the ELCA, we enter into inter-religious relations on the basis of our Christian identity and Lutheran self-
understanding. As we engage with our neighbors of other religions and worldviews, it is important that we clearly 
articulate who we are, what we believe, and why.  
“This church confesses Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and the Gospel as the power of God for the salvation 
of all who believe” (ELCA Constitution, Chapter 2). As a confessional church, we understand ourselves to 
be evangelical, catholic, and ecumenical. “To be evangelical means to be committed to the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ. … To be catholic means to be committed to the fullness of the apostolic faith and its creedal, doctrinal 
articulation for the entire world. … To be ecumenical means to be committed to the oneness to which God calls 
the world in the saving gift of Jesus Christ” (“A Declaration of Ecumenical Commitment,” 1991).
“Jesus Christ is the Word of God incarnate, through whom everything was made and through whose life, death, 
and resurrection God fashions a new creation” (ELCA Constitution, Chapter 2). This is the gospel – the good 
news of what God has done, is doing, and will do for all in Christ. It is a gift from God, freely given, without any 
requirements that need to be fulfilled. “Sharing the good news,” or evangelism, is using words and deeds to pass 
this life-changing message along to others. We describe this as the work of the Great Commission (Matthew 
28:19-20). As witnesses to the good news of Jesus Christ, we entrust to the Holy Spirit the work of turning that 
witness into faith.
 
With the work of being a witness comes an invitation to love God and to love and serve the neighbor, which 
is known as the Great Commandment (Matthew 22:34-40). This neighborly response is not fueled simply

A Declaration of Inter-Religious Commitment:
by human kindness. We believe that God entrusts to us as “in clay jars” (2 Corinthians 4:7) the “message 
of reconciliation” for all (2 Corinthians 5:19). We believe that “Christ, our peace, has put an end to the 
hostility of race, ethnicity, gender, and economic class” (“Freed in Christ: Race, Ethnicity, and Culture,” ELCA 
social statement, 1993, p. 1). In a deeply divided world, and as a faithful response to Christ’s message of 
reconciliation, we seek right, peaceful, and just relationships with all our neighbors, including those of other 
religions and worldviews. We do this as an expression of our Christian faith, and as a continuation of the 
covenant God made with us in holy baptism “to serve all people, following the example of Jesus, and to strive 
for justice and peace in all the earth” (Evangelical Lutheran Worship (ELW), Affirmation of Baptism). 
CONTEXT
Our context, whether understood locally or globally, is multi-religious. Our Lutheran vocation both shapes and 
is shaped by our engagement with religious diversity.
Encountering religious diversity
Religious diversity has continually shaped American society,  starting with the indigenous peoples of this land. 
Though many colonizers came to this land in search of religious freedom, they systematically and violently denied 
it to the indigenous peoples already here. We publicly confess this sin in our 2016 ELCA “Repudiation of the 
Doctrine of Discovery,” which was an important step in a long path toward “repentance and reconciliation to native 
nations in this country for damage done in the name of Christianity.”
Every chapter of U.S. history has had a lasting impact on our identity as a religiously diverse nation. This 
includes our sinful history of slavery, as well as various waves of migration and immigration. In recent 
decades, this history, as well as new patterns of forced displacement and new kinds of religious affiliation, has 
resulted in rapid and radical changes to our multi-religious landscape. Christians in the United States are now 
more likely than in previous generations to encounter neighbors of other religions and worldviews in their 
communities, schools, workplaces, civic spaces, circles of friends, and families. 
Responding to our context
As a church, we must consider anew our calling and commitments in a multi-religious world. Many Lutherans 
and Lutheran ministries already participate in inter-religious activities such as theological dialogue, advocacy, 
and service, which build mutual understanding and advance the common good, defined as justice and peace 
for all of creation. As Lutherans, we are called to move from mere coexistence to a more robust engagement. 
It is through authentic, mutual relationships that we can truly love our neighbors as people made in the 
image of God. This commitment includes confronting whenever possible the often-compounding oppressions 
experienced by people of various religions and worldviews on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, and class.

Fear and division 
There are many ways individuals and communities can respond to religious difference. The most harmful 
responses are grounded in ignorance and fear, which can breed stereotypes. In the extreme, these 
responses can fuel incidents of religious bigotry, restrict religious freedoms, and arouse conflicts that are 
destructive of life, property, and the environment.
 
We live in a context of ongoing anti-Muslim bigotry and anti-Semitism, as well as incidents of harassment 
and violence directed against these and other minority religious and ethnic communities. In some cases, 
the words and deeds of a few are used to discredit entire religious communities. Unfortunately, in every 
religion, Christianity included, some people distort, misuse, or abuse religion to incite violence and 
cause harm. We ought not allow these voices to determine or influence our perception of our neighbors. 
The ELCA must play an active role in dispelling fear of our neighbors, opposing religious bigotry, and 
standing with those who are the targets of fear, discrimination, hatred, and violence.
Inaction
Another possible response to religious diversity is inaction. For some of us, an encounter with religious 
difference may seem a distant reality or one we are not quite ready to acknowledge. We may have limited 
information and experiences, which can mean we are less motivated to reach out to our neighbors. All of 
us have been exposed to stereotypes, which may seem harmless when not acted on or spoken aloud. Yet, 
in the face of bigotry, such stereotypes are not neutral. They, too, can be destructive. Luther interprets 
the Eighth Commandment, “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor,” to mean not only 
that “we do not tell lies about our neighbors, betray or slander them, or destroy their reputations” but 
also that we should “come to their defense, speak well of them, and interpret everything they do in the 
best possible light” (Small Catechism). Such action is, in fact, required of us. 
Active engagement
When the alternatives are so devastating, respectful conversation, dialogue, advocacy, accompaniment, 
friendship, and cooperation are imperative. We are called to move beyond encountering our religiously 
diverse neighbors to actively engaging with them. This calling leads to concrete commitments that we strive 
to live out as people of faith. We are freed in Christ to engage our neighbors in a multi-religious world.
Expanding our inter-religious commitments
Our relationship to each of our neighbors of other religions and worldviews is vitally important. At the same 
time, Christians have had a particularly rich yet complex relationship with Jews and Muslims. In significantly 
different ways, all three traditions claim to worship the God of Abraham. Given this kinship, Lutherans have 
a responsibility to overcome stereotypes and misunderstandings of Muslims and Jews and to seek fuller 
understanding and cooperation. Doing so may well involve rethinking aspects of Christian self-understanding.
5
A Declaration of Inter-Religious Commitment:
This “Declaration of Inter-Religious Commitment” reaffirms the 1994 “Declaration of the ELCA to the Jewish 
Community.” At the same time, it extends the scope of our calling to additional neighbors too – including those 
of other religions, those who identify with multiple religious and spiritual traditions, and those who are not religious.
Beyond Judaism and Islam, the ELCA engages with other religious communities, including Buddhists, Hindus, 
and Sikhs, among others. The state, national, and world councils of churches have played a significant role in 
expanding the breadth of our inter-religious dialogue and in exploring how we understand and relate to other 
neighbors who self-identify as Christian, but are not trinitarian, such as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-
day Saints and Jehovah’s Witnesses. On the whole, we affirm the value of pursuing inter-religious dialogue in 
partnership with others whenever possible. 
The ELCA also participates in multi-religious coalitions, organizations, and initiatives that seek the common 
good. Though many religious traditions and worldviews are represented, these interactions provide 
opportunities for particular relationships to grow. As we are more frequently asked to articulate who we are 
and what we believe, multi-religious groups can also be spaces where we grow in our Lutheran
self-understanding and vocation. 
Occasions arise when reaching out directly as Lutherans is an important expression of our calling to love 
and serve our neighbor — for example, in response to an incident of religious bigotry or in pursuit of 
dialogue around a specific theological issue. Expanding and at the same time deepening our relations with 
our neighbors of other religions is a growing opportunity for the ELCA, and for the ecumenical movement 
as a whole. As our neighborhoods come to reflect greater religious diversity, our call to love and serve our 
neighbors also expands.  
Relating to neighbors who are not religious 
This declaration focuses on neighbors who practice other religions. However, many people in the United States 
are religiously unaffiliated. Some, such as atheists or secular humanists, have rejected religion and a belief in 
God; others have affirmed individual spirituality over institutional and/or church affiliation. As Lutherans, we 
affirm that we are called to build relationships with all our neighbors. Many who are unaffiliated are longing 
to see Christians practicing the generosity and love they profess and are eager to cooperate on projects that 
improve the larger community. Such cooperation is a way of practicing our calling, as well as a way of giving 
authentic witness to our faith. 
Pastoral considerations
There are many pastoral considerations beyond the scope of this declaration, for example, the common 
reality of multi-religious family life. Therefore, the church recognizes the need for the ongoing development 
of appropriate pastoral aids, including guidelines for inter-religious marriages, pastoral counseling, religious 
education, and joint prayer services. In general, the ELCA is open to participating in inter-religious prayer 
6
A policy statement of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
services that honor the integrity, distinctive commitments, and gifts of each tradition, and reflect prayerful 
understanding and careful planning.
VISION
A biblical understanding of God’s vision inspires our calling. The prophets received and shared this vision, and 
Jesus taught and embodied it. 
A biblical vision
God’s vision is of a world in which humans and creation, in all their glorious diversity, live in unity, justice, 
and peace. In such a world, hope abounds, and fear no longer separates one person from another or one 
people from another. In this vision, “justice roll[s] down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing 
stream” (Amos 5:24) and “the leaves of the tree [of life] are for the healing of the nations” (Revelation 22:2b). 
We envision a world in which God’s grace and mercy are celebrated, and all of God’s creatures and all of God’s 
creation are regarded with value and treated with care. 
The Scriptures reflect God’s yearning for such a world, but they also recognize that we live between the 
inauguration of God’s vision and its fulfillment. In the meantime, we struggle to “renounce the devil and all 
the forces that defy God” (ELW, Holy Baptism) as we experience the gift of Christ in us and the gift of the Holy 
Spirit calling us to celebrate every sign of reconciliation and wholeness. 
As a community of faith, we are inspired to put God’s vision into practice here and now, even if we can see 
only vague outlines of its fulfillment. We realize that we will fall short of the glory of God. Nevertheless, we live 
in love and hope. We seek to foster healthy relations and healthy communities in which all can flourish. We 
break the cycle of escalating retaliation that divides and destroys. With God’s help, we seek to mend and heal 
the world that God so dearly and deeply loves. 
Guided by God’s vision and sobered by this realization, we seek, as one part of our undertaking, to achieve 
mutual understanding among all people of different religions and worldviews and to inspire all to work 
together for the common good. In doing so we give an account of the hope that is within us (1 Peter 3:15b). 
Mutual understanding
When we engage our religiously diverse neighbors, we can expect both a new understanding of the other and 
a deeper understanding and appreciation of our own Christian faith. “Mutual understanding” involves moving 
from factual knowledge of commonalities and differences to grasping coherence and even glimpsing beauty.  
In discovering how others love and cherish their religious traditions, we more deeply love and cherish our 
own. We empathize with the challenges and struggles others face in their religious commitments, as well as 
appreciate their joys. Mutual understanding opens the possibility of friendship and accepting responsibility for 
each other’s well-being.
7
A Declaration of Inter-Religious Commitment:
As such, mutual understanding does not diminish but rather deepens our own faith. Luther was clear that our 
understanding of faith can and does grow and change: as we experience new things in life, study and learn, 
and meditate and pray. Hence, a person’s understanding can change without one’s faith being undermined. By 
engaging our neighbors, we learn to articulate our own faith more clearly and to see in it things we had not 
noticed or appreciated before. We learn to express what being a follower of Jesus really means to us. We learn 
that religious differences need not erect barriers. In all of this, relying on the Holy Spirit, we experience more of 
the mystery and glory of God.  
Common good
As we strive to show forth God’s vision, we are called to work toward justice and peace for all people and 
creation, that is, the common good. Religious diversity, when accompanied by mutual understanding and 
cooperation, enriches the whole. Through inter-religious relationships, we receive the gifts of our neighbors 
and experience more fully the exquisite realization that all are made in the image of God. A deep appreciation 
of the similarities and differences among religions and worldviews enhances working together for the common 
good. At the same time, cooperation can enhance both mutual understanding and the self-understanding of 
each participant. Seeking mutual understanding and the common good are active steps we can take toward 
God’s vision of life abundant for all. 
CALLING
Our calling is a dual calling: to be faithful witnesses to Christ and to love God by loving and serving 
our neighbors. The Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20) stands alongside the Great Commandment 
(Matthew 22:34-40).  
Our Lutheran tradition distinguishes between “two kingdoms” of God. When Luther made this distinction, he 
was thinking not of two separate geographical territories but of two different ways, or “rules,” in which God 
interacts with humans. These include: 1) showing mercy, overcoming our alienation, and giving us new life 
through Jesus Christ and 2) working through social, political, and economic institutions and authorities to 
safeguard human life and welfare. 
Sharing the good news, or evangelism, contributes to the first rule. We do this in response to the Great 
Commission (Matthew 28:19-20). Serving the community, which includes inter-religious relations, contributes to 
the second. We do this in gratitude for God’s mercy and in response to the Great Commandment to love God 
and to love our neighbor as ourselves (Matthew 22:39). In both rules, or kingdoms, God calls us to approach all 
relationships with love, grace, mercy, and a concern for distributive and restorative justice.
Evangelism
We are committed to engaging our neighbors without compromising who we are or the fullness of the calling 
we have received. An integral part of this calling is to be witnesses to Christ (Acts 1:8)—to evangelize. As 
8
A policy statement of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
understood by Lutherans, evangelism is sharing through our lives the joy of the good news of what God has 
done in and through Christ. 
This sharing occurs in many ways, in word and in deed—always respecting the dignity of the other and always 
offered in love. It occurs best in the context of an already established relationship of trust. We acknowledge 
that at times we have betrayed this trust, substituting manipulation and coercion for evangelism. As we 
express the power of life in Christ, we do so in ways that honor our convictions that every human is made in 
the image of God (Genesis 1:27) and that all of creation is good (Genesis 1:31).
We also rely on the Spirit, who alone creates faith. As we are taught in Luther’s Small Catechism, “by my own 
understanding or strength I cannot believe in Jesus Christ my Lord or come to him, but instead the Holy Spirit 
has called me through the gospel [and] enlightened me with his gifts” (ELW, Explanation to the Third Article 
of the Apostles’ Creed). We are saved by grace, unable to do anything to contribute to our own salvation, or to 
that of others.
Our faith compels us to respond to the gift we have received through the Spirit by freely and joyfully sharing 
the good news. We have claimed this evangelical commitment, and it is reflected even in our name. We know 
that “the Gospel is more than human recollection of, or our confession about, what God has done in the past. 
... It is proclamation with the power of God’s deed in Christ and in his resurrection (2 Corinthians 5:19b-21), 
an event that opens to us the future of God’s eternal love” (“A Declaration of Ecumenical Commitment,” 1991). 
With such a sure and certain promise, we anticipate that not only may God work through others, God may also 
work through us when we witness to a God of generosity and forgiveness, a God who loves humans, values 
their freedom, and works for their wholeness. As we engage our neighbors in the fullness of who we are and in 
whom we believe, we expect that so, too, will our partners share with us their deepest selves and convictions.  
Inter-religious relations
Having received both the Great Commission and the Great Commandment, we recognize that inter-religious 
relations are part of our calling to love the neighbor. We are called by God and freed in Christ to witness to the 
life-changing news of Jesus Christ and to love and serve our neighbors in a multi-religious world. This vocation 
includes loving and serving both those who share our faith in Jesus Christ and those who do not. It is our duty 
and joy to extend God’s love, grace, mercy, and justice to all those who are made in the image of God and to the 
whole of creation. In other words, we are called to inter-religious engagement because we are Lutheran. We live 
out this calling in three ways.
Love our neighbor
Central to the Lutheran tradition is every person’s calling, or vocation, to love and serve God and our 
neighbor. As Luther reminded us, God asks that we direct our gratitude for God’s generosity outward 
9
A Declaration of Inter-Religious Commitment:
to others rather than upward in activities intended to please God. Luther called this our vocation. 
Alongside “grace alone,” this was arguably his second most important teaching. Vocation affects every 
area of life. Our vocation, our calling to be a neighbor, excludes no one, even those whose religion is 
different from our own. Commenting on the parable of the Good Samaritan, Martin Luther defined the 
neighbor this way: “Now our neighbor is any human being, especially one who needs our help” (Martin 
Luther, “Letters to Galatians, 1535,” Luther’s Works). We are to extend God’s mercy to all, and to love 
our neighbors as ourselves (Luke 10:25-37, Matthew 19:19).
Serve (alongside) our neighbor 
Our vocation includes service to the individual neighbor and to the community as a whole. To know 
how to best serve the community, we need to understand what benefits all parts of that community. 
This means reaching out to neighbors across the boundaries of religion, race, ethnicity, gender, and 
class. Our vocation also includes serving alongside our neighbor, as we respond together to meet the 
needs of others. While we may not necessarily share the same religious inspiration for doing so, our 
shared vision for peace and justice leads us to engage in service for the sake of the world. 
Live in solidarity with our neighbor
Being a neighbor can be risky. When power is abused, and fear grips a community or a nation, 
standing up for those who are being targeted or excluded takes courage. We are called to exhibit 
this courage and take this risk. In the face of social pressures that make us feel paralyzed, our 
calling includes developing a sense of agency—that is, a sense that each of us can make a difference. 
Our attention needs to be focused on our God-given gifts and responsibilities rather than on the 
many impediments to acting on behalf of those who are being maligned or harassed or harmed, 
recognizing that some of our neighbors are experiencing multiple forms of oppression at once. 
For all of this, a support community of fellow believers and inter-religious partners can make an 
empowering difference.  
In the United States, many Christians live in neighborhoods that are predominantly Christian, where 
social expectations, such as holidays, school vacations, work rules, and the clothes we wear, have 
accommodated their beliefs and practices. The same is often not true for our neighbors who practice 
other religions or those who practice no religion at all. They can be at a disadvantage and made to feel 
like outsiders. As a result, we are called to be sensitive toward our neighbors of other religions and 
worldviews, engaging them in the spirit of accompaniment. This includes listening and learning, giving 
and receiving. It also means recognizing that other religions are organized differently, sometimes with 
very few or no structures corresponding to our own. Assumptions about cultural norms, affecting both 
ourselves and our neighbors, need to be constantly identified and avoided. Determining together the 
right pace for building and deepening partnerships is a way in which we can begin to practice mutual 
hospitality and live in solidarity with our neighbor.
10
A policy statement of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
Our calling is to be both faithful witnesses and good neighbors. We enter into this calling in a spirit of humility 
and self-criticism, repentant of our past mistakes, anticipating that we will continue to fall short of God’s vision, 
and committed to the justice, peace, and well-being of our neighbors. We accept that we will have unanswered 
questions about how God is working in and through our neighbors of other religions and even in and through 
us. Yet, we anticipate that in loving, serving, and standing in solidarity with our neighbors, we will experience the 
presence of God, participate in building a more just and peaceful world, and find our faith enriched. 
COMMITMENTS
We participate in God’s mission in an increasingly multi-religious world. Locally and globally, there are examples 
of religious communities coexisting peacefully but also examples of conflict, violence, discrimination, bigotry, 
intolerance, and persecution. In the midst of this, God has entrusted to us a vision of unity, justice, and peace. 
Therefore, in faithful response to God’s love in Christ Jesus, we are called and committed to: 
•	
Seek mutual understanding with our neighbors of other religions and worldviews.
•	
Cooperate with our neighbors of other religions and worldviews as instruments of God’s justice and peace.
Across the ELCA, the form of our inter-religious relations will vary depending on context. As a church, we hold 
these commitments in common as a policy to guide our work and as a measure of accountability to our inter-
religious partners.  
1.	 The ELCA will pray for the well-being of our wonderfully diverse human family, including our neighbors 
of other religions and worldviews (ELW, Prayer for the Human Family, p. 79).
2.	 The ELCA will articulate why we both cherish the gospel, Scripture, the creeds, and confessions at the 
core of our Christian identity and Lutheran self-understanding and seek to understand our neighbor’s 
core identity and self-understanding in a spirit of mutual respect (“Christian Witness in a Multi-Religious 
World: Recommendations for Conduct,” the World Council of Churches, Pontifical Council for Interreligious 
Dialogue & World Evangelical Alliance, 2011). 
3.	 The ELCA will witness to the power of life in Christ in and through our daily lives. We will seek to be 
ethical, transparent, and concerned for the integrity of our neighbor’s rights and religious sensibilities as 
we share our faith with others (Report from Inter-Religious Consultation on Conversion, World Council 
of Churches, Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, 2006).
4.	 The ELCA, in dialogue with our partners, will seek to understand the religions of the world so as to 
enhance mutual understanding as well as to be able to identify the misuse of any religion to justify 
oppression, such as violence, genocide, or terrorism. 
5.	 The ELCA will seek to know our neighbors in order to overcome stereotypes about them, “to come to 
their defense, speak well of them, and interpret everything they do in the best possible light” (Small 
Catechism, Eighth Commandment). 
6.	 The ELCA will explore and encourage inter-religious friendship, accompaniment, and partnership 
with all who seek justice, peace, human wholeness, and the well-being of creation (ELCA Constitution, 
Chapter 4.03.f).

7.	 The ELCA will, whenever possible, work with other Christians and through ecumenical and inter-religious 
coalitions in its quest for inter-religious understanding and cooperation (“Lund Principle,” 1952).
8.	 The ELCA will seek counsel from other religious groups in its discernment of and advocacy for the 
common good.
9.	 The ELCA will defend the full participation of all in our religiously diverse society, “strengthening public 
space as a just place for all” regardless of religion or worldview (“The Church in the Public Space: A 
Statement of The Lutheran World Federation,” 2016). 
10.	The ELCA will defend human rights and oppose all forms of religious bigotry, violence, discrimination, 
and persecution and stand in solidarity with those who experience them, whether they are Christian 
or of another religion or worldview (“Human Rights” ELCA Social Message, 2017; “For Peace in God’s 
World” ELCA Social Statement, 1995; “Freed in Christ: Race, Ethnicity, and Culture” ELCA Social 
Statement, 1993; “Church in Society: A Lutheran Perspective” ELCA Social Statement, 1991). 
11.	The ELCA will confess when our words or deeds (or lack thereof) cause offense, harm, or violence to 
our neighbors of other religions and worldviews and will repent and seek forgiveness from God and 
reconciliation with our neighbors (“Luther, Lutheranism, and Jews,” The Lutheran World Federation, 
1984; ELCA “Declaration to the Jewish Community,” 1994; ELCA “Repudiation of the Doctrine of 
Discovery,” 2016).
12.	The ELCA will produce study and dialogue materials and pastoral guidelines for understanding and 
engaging with our neighbors of other religions and worldviews and seek counsel from inter-religious 
partners in the development of such resources. 
AFTERWORD: BIBLICAL AND THEOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS
As a policy statement, this document seeks to provide a common framework for 
inter-religious relations across the ELCA. This work takes a variety of forms and moves in differing 
directions. That is, dialogue can foster study, and study can lead to dialogue. Conversation can lead to 
cooperation, and cooperation can foster dialogue. Group experiences can produce one-to-one relationships, 
and one-to-one relationships can lead to group encounters. Whatever form inter-religious relations takes, the 
goal should be to achieve ever-deeper mutual understanding and to maximize cooperation for the sake of the 
world, and all of creation.
Many ELCA members and participants have experience with inter-religious relations. Their good work opens 
opportunities for us to replicate or to join rather than needing to invent or to initiate. It is not possible to provide 
a comprehensive list of these activities. Food banks, social service projects, and racial and economic justice 
work, when undertaken cooperatively with our neighbors of other religions and worldviews, are examples. 
So are advocacy endeavors, such as working for the care of creation or the reduction of HIV and AIDS. Some 
congregations share their buildings with other religious communities and find the relationship mutually 
enriching. ELCA colleges and seminaries have faculty, students, and courses that reflect religious diversity. 
They also have programs and groups that seek to foster sensitivity to religious difference and competencies for 
vocational living in a multi-religious world. When welcoming and receiving refugees as new neighbors, Lutherans

have carefully and compassionately tended to the important dimensions of religion and culture. For more 
examples, see Engaging Others, Knowing Ourselves: A Lutheran Calling in a Multi-Religious World (Lutheran 
University Press, 2016). 
While the framework offered by this policy statement is flexible, it is also firmly rooted in the scriptural, 
confessional, and theological witness of the Lutheran tradition. While we may undertake our calling to inter-
religious relations in various contexts and ways, we do so undergirded by what we hold in common. Therefore, 
this declaration will close with an exploration of two key questions: “What do the Scriptures say about people of 
other religions?” and “What are some of the Lutheran convictions that influence our calling?”
WHAT DO THE SCRIPTURES SAY ABOUT PEOPLE OF OTHER RELIGIONS?
God’s vision
God’s revelation has entrusted to us a vision of whole, healthy relationships among humans, between humans 
and the whole of creation, and between humans and God. Several passages in the Bible help us to see God’s 
vision more clearly. We think of the wolf lying down with the lamb; swords beaten into plowshares and spears 
into pruning hooks; workers able to enjoy the fruits of the trees they have planted; people turning the other 
cheek and going the second mile; and a city with its gates wide open for all, with plenty of food, water, and 
medicine, and with God so close that no special building is needed (Isaiah 2:4, 65:21-22; Matthew 5:39-41; 
Revelation 21:22, 25 and 22:1-2). 
In light of God’s vision, our calling is to help each other, and our neighbors, to make it manifest. With our 
lives, we become signs of this vision; through our whole, healthy relationships we come to see it more 
clearly. Our calling to live out this vision includes our relationships with our neighbors of other religions 
and worldviews. Every time we initiate, restore, heal, and embody such relationships, we take a step, 
however feebly, toward the wholeness that God intends. Our hope for the realization of God’s vision guides 
and supports our calling and commitments. 
Other religions in the Bible
The Bible contains no uniform perspective regarding people of other religions. In some cases, the leaders of 
Israel try to draw a sharp line between the Israelites and their neighbors. In other cases, God is portrayed as 
working through neighbors who practice other religions. There are numerous examples: 
•	
Moses receives valuable advice from Jethro, a priest of Midian, not an Israelite, who also happens to be 
his father-in-law (Exodus 18). 
•	
Cyrus of Persia, who did not worship the God of Israel, is “anointed” by God to deliver the Israelites 
from exile (Isaiah 45:1). 
•	
Jesus encounters a Canaanite woman and is moved by her faith to heal her daughter (Matthew 15:27). 
•	
Jesus responds to the needs of a Roman centurion, a commander within the occupying forces—not likely 
a person who practiced Judaism (Matthew 8:5-13 and Luke 7:1-10). 
13
A Declaration of Inter-Religious Commitment:
•	
In the story of Abimelech, Abraham, and Sarah, it is the outsider Abimelech who listens to God and 
does what is right (Genesis 20). 
•	
The Canaanite named Rahab hides the two spies Joshua sent to find out about Jericho prior to its 
conquest (Joshua 2). 
•	
And the magi from the east, who likely did not practice Judaism, visit and honor the infant Jesus 
(Matthew 2:1-12). 
These are but a few examples of how God loves and works with, in, and through people of various religions. 
These passages reveal the surprising truth that God at times invites Christians to learn from and even emulate 
people of other religions. These scriptural stories invite us to listen, ponder, and discover, from a position of 
humility, how God might use inter-religious relations to instruct us and challenge our faith to grow today. 
WHAT LUTHERAN CONVICTIONS INFLUENCE OUR CALLING?
Theology is relational
Lutheran theology is relational. Our religious communication needs to be assessed on whether it restores 
whole relationships and opens the door to new life or whether it harms another person or disregards the value 
of God’s creation. When said in the wrong way or in the wrong setting, even “the right words” can be harmful. 
The same is true for actions. They, too, need to be evaluated in terms of their benefits or their damage to 
others and to the larger community. So, a relational theology examines both our words and actions in terms 
of whether they strengthen or undermine healthy relationships. This applies to words and actions that give 
expression to God’s love and forgiveness (in response to the Great Commission) and to words and actions that 
seek to aid a struggling neighbor (in response to the Great Commandment).  
Another indication of a theology that is relational is the Lutheran understanding of faith as trust. Faith is 
relational and not simply, or even primarily, about affirming beliefs. Faith is a response to the love of God, not 
a prerequisite for that love.
The observation that theology is relational helps us understand why Lutheran theology so often employs 
paradoxes—that is, it affirms as true two seemingly contradictory statements, such as “a Christian is a perfectly 
free lord of all, subject to none” and “a Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all” (Luther, “The 
Freedom of a Christian”). Other examples are that God is both hidden and revealed and that a Christian is both 
justified and a sinner. This capacity for paradox can also be extended to the tension we hold between our dual 
commitments to evangelism and inter-religious relations. These formulations seek to point beyond themselves 
to a deeper truth that is relational rather than propositional.    
The stance of this declaration is influenced at every point by the relational character of Lutheran theology.

Grace without prerequisites
This declaration affirms and celebrates the gift of new life that comes from God but does not seek to explain 
God’s relationship with other religions. There are several reasons for this. Our Lutheran tradition has 
emphasized that God’s grace is given as a gift without any prerequisites. When God restores relations with us, 
it is entirely a result of God’s action, not something we have earned. As a result, we cannot know the limits 
of God’s grace and love. Any attempt to define a limit introduces a prerequisite. Because we do not know its 
limits, God’s remarkable generosity toward us frees us to engage in inter-religious outreach, and in this way to 
embody for our neighbors God’s generosity. Our calling is to come to know our neighbors, to assist them, to 
work with them, and in doing so to see in them the image of God. 
Limits on our knowing 
The Lutheran tradition offers other reasons for caution about our claims to know. 
•	
Luther said that no human could know another person’s relationship with God. What that person says or 
does gives us clues, but, ultimately, we cannot see into someone else’s heart (Luther, Bondage of the Will). 
•	
Similarly, Luther insisted that we cannot know the inner workings of God. God has revealed God’s 
attitude toward us, overall purpose, and character, but the inner workings of God remain hidden. Hence, 
we must be careful about claiming to know God’s judgments regarding another religion or the individual 
human beings who practice it. 
•	
There is another reason for caution. As mentioned above, the Lutheran tradition has understood the 
word “faith” to mean trust rather than affirming beliefs. Hence, we also must be careful not to judge our 
neighbors only on the basis of their religious beliefs, as they may or may not tell us much about how 
our neighbors relate to God. There is no substitute for exploring together what matters most to others 
and to us.  
The full story of the relationship between our neighbor and God is beyond our knowledge, and even our 
calling. In the context of inter-religious relations, we do not need answers to these questions in order to treat 
one another with love and respect, find ways to cooperate for the sake of the larger community, practice 
hospitality, or witness to the good news of God’s love, forgiveness, and new life in Christ. All we know, and all 
we need to know, is that our neighbors are made in God’s image and that we are called to love and serve them. 
 
Ever-depending on forgiveness
Our calling to inter-religious relations depends on God’s forgiveness. We need to acknowledge not only our 
own personal errors and omissions but also the collective errors of our tradition. These include misdeeds, 
such as our readiness to benefit from the conquest of American Indian people and land, chattel slavery, the 
treatment of the Jews during and after the Reformation, and our readiness to take up arms against those of 
another religion. And they include failures to reach out to people of all races, ethnicities, and cultures within 
our church and in society. Not only do we rely on forgiveness for the past, we also rely on forgiveness for the 
present and the future. Because our responsibility for others has no limits, inevitably our best efforts will fall 
15
A Declaration of Inter-Religious Commitment:
short, and we are likely to make new mistakes that harm others. When we engage our neighbors, we therefore 
rely on forgiveness as we reach out into unfamiliar territory, navigating religious and cultural differences. The 
promise of forgiveness sets us free to risk the unfamiliar. 
Acknowledging suffering
At the heart of Luther’s “theology of the cross” is a unique view of God present in the person of the crucified 
Jesus. Jesus’ suffering on the cross was a redemptive suffering for the sake of all. The Jesus who endured the 
cross is also present with us, all humans, and the whole creation in times of suffering (Romans 8:18-25). 
This understanding of a “theology of the cross” causes us to take the reality of suffering seriously. As Christian 
disciples we are called to take up the cross, acting on behalf of others to seek ways to end the suffering of 
others, even though doing so may lead us to suffer with them. This is part of our vocation as Christians. And, 
when ending suffering is not possible, we are still called to accompany – to be with – those who suffer, just as 
in Christ God came to be with us.
Acknowledging the reality of suffering unites us not only with God but also with one another. The 
commonality and universality of human suffering binds us inextricably to each other. This reality influences 
our understanding of our vocation. When we acknowledge the suffering of those whose beliefs are different 
from our own and when we recognize the commonality of suffering, we find a fuller, more compassionate 
understanding of those who differ and a common calling to alleviate suffering wherever it exists. At the same 
time, when we recognize the suffering of other Christians who experience discrimination or attacks because 
of their religious beliefs, we can appreciate how inter-religious relations can support not only cooperation but, 
indeed, survival. Amid suffering of all forms, we stand together, not apart. 
God in the world
As we respond to our calling, we are confident that God is at work caring for all of creation, respecting human 
freedom and dignity, and fostering wholeness. We are sent out into the world by a God who is already at work. 
When we reach out to a neighbor, we are reaching out to someone who, whether the person acknowledges it or 
not, has already received gifts from God. In addition, just as the love of God reaches us through the words and 
actions of others, so our own words and actions can serve as “channels” (Luther’s word) of God’s gifts to others.
CONCLUSION AND BENEDICTION
We are called to learn to know and understand our neighbors and to work together for their well-being. We are 
called to work with them to overcome the obstacles and suffering they face, and to build justice and peace for 
all people and for God’s creation. We are called to overcome the isolation that separates neighbors from one 
another. Having heard the good news of Jesus Christ, we are called to live in hope and engagement, not fear 
and inaction.

A policy statement of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
Our calling is a responsibility, yes, and it is also a joy. Engagement with our neighbors enriches our lives and 
our faith. In relationship with our neighbors, we come to understand more fully the depth and breadth of the 
riches of God and to appreciate more deeply the wonder of God’s generous love, which we experience through 
the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. We discern more accurately how to reflect God’s generosity 
in our thinking and in our behavior. As individuals and as neighbors, we benefit from the increased health of 
our communities and from a world that is more just and peaceful. Authentic and mutual relationships are 
transformative.   
May God bless the efforts of this church as we set our sights on God’s vision, as we seek to respond to God’s 
calling in our context, and as we strive to uphold these commitments.
