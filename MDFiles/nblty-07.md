<b><center>Proposals for Reform<br>
Part III</center></b>
 
<blockquote><blockquote>
 
 
<p>25. The universities also need a good, thorough reformation -- I must say it 
 no matter whom it vexes -- for everything which the papacy has instituted and 
 ordered is directed only towards the increasing of sin and error. What else 
 are the universities, if their present condition remains unchanged, than as 
 the book of Maccabees says, 2 Macc. 4:9, 12: <b>Gymnasia Epheborum et Graecae 
 gloriae</b>,[1] in which loose living prevails, the Holy Scriptures and the 
 Christian faith are little taught, and the blind, heathen master Aristotle[2] 
 rules alone, even more than Christ. In this regard my advice would be that 
 Aristotle's <b>Physics</b>, <b>Metaphysics</b>, <b>On the Soul</b>, <b>Ethics</b>, which have 
 hitherto been thought his best books, should be altogether discarded, together 
 with all the rest of his books which boast of treating the things of nature, 
 although nothing can be learned from the either of the things of nature or the 
 things of the Spirit. Moreover no one has so far understood his meaning, 
and many 
 souls have been burdened with profitless labor and study, at the cost of much 
 precious time. I venture to say that any potter has more knowledge of nature 
 than is written in these books. It grieves me to the heart that this damned, 
 conceited, rascally heathen has with his false words deluded and made fools of 
 so many of the best Christians. God has sent him as a plague upon us for our 
 sins. </p>
 
<p>Why, this wretched man, in his best book, <b>On the Soul</b>, teaches that the soul 
 dies with the body, although many have tried with vain words to save his 
 reputation. As though we had not the Holy Scriptures, in which we are 
 abundantly instructed about all things, and of them Aristotle had not the 
 faintest inkling! And yet this dead heathen has conquered and obstructed and 
 almost suppressed the books of the living God, so that when I think of this 
 miserable business I can believe nothing else than that the evil spirit has 
 introduced the study of Aristotle. </p>
 
<p>Again, his book on <b>Ethics</b> is the worst of all books. It flatly opposes divine 
 grace and all Christian virtues, and yet it is considered one of his best 
 works. Away with such books! Keep them away from all Christians! Let no one 
 accuse me of exaggeration, or of condemning what I do not understand! My dear 
 friend, I know well whereof I speak. I know my Aristotle as well as you or 
 the likes of you. I have lectured on him[3] and heard lectures on him, and 
 I understand him better than do St. Thomas or Scotus.[4] This I can say 
 without pride, and if necessary I can prove it. I care not that so many great 
 minds have wearied themselves over him for so many hundred years. Such 
 objections do not disturb me as once they did; for it is plain as day that 
 other errors have remained for even more centuries in the world and in the 
 universities. </p>
 
<p>I should be glad to see Aristotle's books on <b>Logic</b>, <b>Rhetoric</b> and <b>Poetics</b> 
 retained or used in an abridged form as text-books for the profitable 
 training of young people in speaking and preaching. But the commentaries and 
 notes should be abolished, and as Cicero's <b>Rhetoric</b> is read without 
 commentaries and notes, so Aristotle's Logic should be read as it is, without 
 such a mass of comments. But now neither speaking nor preaching is learned 
 from it, and it has become nothing but a disputing and a weariness to the 
 flesh. </p>
 
<p>Besides this there are the languages -- Latin, Greek and Hebrew -- the 
 mathematical disciplines and history. But all this I give over to the 
 specialists, and, indeed, the reform would come of itself, if we were only 
 seriously bent upon it. In truth, much depends upon it; for it is here[5] 
 that the Christian youth and the best of our people, with whom the future of 
 Christendom lies, are to be educated and trained. Therefore I consider that 
 there is no work more worthy of pope or emperor than a thorough reformation of 
 the universities, and there is nothing worse or more worthy of the devil than 
 unreformed universities. </p>
 
<p>The medical men I leave to reform their own faculties; the jurists and 
 theologians I take as my share, and I say, in the first place, that it were 
 well if the canon law, from the first letter to the last, and especially the 
 decretals, were utterly blotted out. The Bible contains more than enough 
 directions for all our living, and so the study of the canon law only stands 
 in the way of the study of the Holy Scriptures; moreover, it smacks for the 
 most part of mere avarice and pride. Even though there were much in it that 
 is good, it might as well be destroyed, for the pope has taken the whole canon 
 law captive and imprisoned it in the "chamber of his hear,[6] so that the 
 study of it is henceforth a waste of time and a farce. At present the canon 
 law is not what is in the books, but what is in the sweet will of the pope and 
 his flatterers. Your cause may be thoroughly established in the canon law; 
 still the pope has his <b>scrinium pectoris</b>,[7] and all law and the whole world 
 must be guided by that. Now it is oft times a knave, and even the devil 
 himself, who rules this scrinium, and they boast that it is ruled by the Holy 
 Spirit! Thus they deal with Christ's unfortunate people. They give them many 
 laws and themselves keep none of them, but others they compel either to keep 
 them or else to buy release. </p>
 
<p>Since, then, the pope and his followers have suspended the whole canon law, 
 and since they pay no heed to it, but regard their own wanton will as a law 
 exalting them above all the world, we should follow their example and for our 
 part also reject these books. Why should we waste our time studying them? We 
 could never discover the whole arbitrary will of the pope, which has now 
 become the canon law. The canon law has arisen in the devil's name, let it 
 fall in the name of God, and let there be no more <b>doctores decretorum</b>[8] in 
 the work, but only <b>doctores scrinii papalis</b>, that is, "hypocrites of the 
 pope"! It is said that there is no better temporal rule anywhere than among 
 the Turks, who have neither spiritual nor temporal law, but only their Koran; 
 and we must confess that there is no more shameful rule than among us, with 
 our spiritual and temporal law, so that there is no estate which lives 
 according to the light of nature, still less according to Holy Scripture. </p>
 
<p>The temporal law, -- God help us! What a wilderness it has become![9] Though 
 it is much better, wiser and more rational than the "spiritual law" which has 
 nothing good about it except the name, still there is far too much of it. 
 Surely the Holy Scriptures and good rulers would be law enough; as St. Paul 
 says in 1 Corinthians 6:1: "Is there no one among you can judge his neighbor's 
 cause, that ye must go to law before heathen courts?" It seems just to me 
 that territorial laws and territorial customs should take precedence of the 
 general imperial laws, and the imperial laws be used only in case of 
 necessity. Would to God that as every land has its own peculiar character, 
 so it were ruled by its own brief laws, as the lands were ruled before these 
 imperial laws were invented, and many lands are still ruled without them! 
 These diffuse and far-fetched laws are only a burden to the people, and hinder 
 causes more than they help them. I hope, however, that others have given this 
 matter more thought and attention than I am able to do. </p>
 
<p>My friends the theologians have spared themselves pains and labor; they leave 
 the Bible in peace and read the Sentences. I should think that the 
Sentences[10] 
 ought to be the first study of young students in theology and the Bible 
 ought to be the study for the doctors. But now it is turned around; the Bible 
 come first, and is put aside when the bachelor's degree is reached, and the 
 Sentences come last. They are attached forever to the doctorate, and that 
 with such a solemn obligation that a man who is not a priest may indeed read 
 may indeed the Bible, but the Sentences a priest must read. A married man, I 
 observe, could be a Doctor of the Bible, but under no circumstances a Doctor 
 of the Sentences. What good fortune can we expect if we act so perversely and 
 in this way put the Bible, the holy Word of God, so far to the rear? Moreover 
 the pope commands, with many severe words, that his laws are to be read and 
 used in the schools and the courts, but little is said of the Gospel. Thus it 
 is the custom that in the schools and the courts the Gospel lies idle in the 
 dust under the bench,[11] to the end that the pope's harmful laws may rule 
 alone. </p>
 
<p>If we are called by the title of teachers[12] of Holy Scripture, then we 
 ought to be compelled, in accordance with our name, to teach the Holy 
 Scriptures and nothing else, although even this title is too proud and 
 boastful and no one ought to be proclaimed and crowned teacher of Holy 
 Scripture. Yet it might be suffered, if the work justified the name; but now, 
 under the despotism of the Sentences, we find among the theologians more of 
 heathen and human opinion than of the holy and certain doctrine of Scripture. 
 What, then, are we to do? I know of no other way than humbly to pray God to 
 give us Doctors of Theology. Pope, emperor and universities may make Doctors 
 of Arts, of Medicine, of Laws, of the Sentences; but be assured that no one 
 will make a Doctor of Holy Scripture, save only the Holy Ghost from heaven, as 
 Christ says in John 6:45: "They must all be taught of God Himself." Now the 
 Holy Ghost does not concern Himself about red or brown birettas[13] or other 
 decorations, nor does He ask whether one is old or young, layman or priest, 
 monk or secular, virgin or married; nay He spake of old by an ass, against 
 the prophet who rode upon it. (Number 22:28). Would God that we were worthy 
 to have such doctors given us, whether they were layman or priests, married or 
 virgin. True, they now try to force the Holy Ghost into pope, bishops and 
 doctors, although there is no sign or indication whatever that He is in them. </p>
 
<p>The number of theological books must also be lessened, and a selection made of 
 the best of them. For it is not many books or much reading that makes men 
 learned; but it is good things, however little of them, often read, that make 
 men learned in the Scriptures, and make them godly, too. Indeed the writings 
 of all the holy fathers should be read only for a time, in order that through 
 them we may be led to the Holy Scriptures. As it is, however, we read them 
 only to be absorbed in them and never come to the Scriptures. We are like men 
 who study the sign-posts and never travel the road. The dear fathers wished, 
 by their writings, to lead us to the Scriptures, but we so use them as to be 
 led away from the Scriptures, though the Scriptures alone are our vineyard in 
 which we ought to work and toil. </p>
 
<p>Above all, the foremost and most general subject of study, both in the higher 
 and the lower schools, should be the Holy Scriptures, and for the young boys 
 the Gospel. And would to God that every town had a girl's school also, in 
 which the girls were taught the Gospel for an hour each day either in German 
 or Latin. Indeed the schools, monasteries and nunneries began long ago with 
 that end in view, and it was a praiseworthy and Christian purpose, as we learn 
 from the story of St. Agnes[14] and other of the saints. That was the time 
 of holy virgins and martyrs, and then it was well with Christendom; but now 
 they[15] have come to nothing but praying and singing. Ought not every 
 Christian at his ninth or tenth year to know the entire holy Gospel from which 
 he derives his name[16] and his life? A spinner or a seamstress teaches her 
 daughter the trade in her early years; but now even the great, learned 
 prelates and bishops themselves do not know the Gospel. </p>
 
<p>O how unjustly we deal with these poor young people who are committed to us 
 for direction and instruction! We must give a terrible accounting for our 
 neglect to set the Word of God before them. They fare as Jeremiah says in 
 Lamentations 2:11 ff.: "Mine eyes are grown weary with weeping, my bowels are 
 terrified, my liver is poured out upon the ground, because of the destruction 
 of the daughter of my people, for the youth and the children perish in all the 
 streets of the whole city; they said to their mothers, "Where is bread and 
 wine? And they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city and gave up 
 the ghost in their mothers' bosom." This pitiful evil we do not see, -- how 
 even now the young folk in the midst of Christendom languish and perish 
 miserably for want of the Gospel, in which we ought to be giving them constant 
 instruction and training. </p>
 
<p>Moreover, if the universities were diligent in the study of Holy Scripture, we 
 should not send everybody there, as we do when all we ask is numbers, and 
 everyone wishes to have a doctor's degree; but we should send only the best 
 qualified students, who have previously been well trained in the lower 
 schools. A prince or city council ought to see to this, and permit only the 
 well qualified to be sent. But where the Holy Scriptures do not rule, there I 
 advise no one to send his son. Everyone not unceasingly busy with the Word of 
 God must become corrupt; that is why the people who are in the universities 
 and who are trained there are the kind of people they are. For this no one is 
 to blame with the training of the youth. For the universities ought to turn 
 out only men who are experts in the Holy Scriptures, who can become bishops 
 and priests, leaders in the fight against heretics, the devil and all the 
 world. But where do you find this true? I greatly fear that the universities 
 are wide gates of hell, if they do not diligently teach the Holy Scriptures 
 and impress them on the youth. </p>
 
<p>26. [17]I know full well that the Roman crowd will make pretensions and 
 great boasts about how the pope took the Holy Roman Empire from the Greek 
 Emperor[18] and bestowed it on the Germans, for which honor and benevolence 
 he is said to have justly deserved and obtained from the Germans submission 
 and thanks and all good things. For this reason they will, perhaps, 
 undertake to throw to the winds all attempts to reform them, and will not 
 allow us to think about anything but the bestowal of the Roman Empire. For 
 this cause they have heretofore persecuted and oppressed many a worthy emperor 
 so arbitrarily and arrogantly that it is pity to tell of it, and with the same 
 adroitness they have made themselves overlords of all the temporal powers and 
 authorities, contrary to the Holy Gospel. Of this too I must therefore speak. </p>
 
<p>There is no doubt that the true Roman Empire, which the writings of the 
 prophets foretold in Numbers 24:24 and in Daniel 2:39 ff., has long since been 
 overthrown and brought to an end, as Balaam clearly prophesied in Numbers 
 24:24:, when he said: "The Romans shall come and overthrow the Jews; and 
 afterwards they also shall be destroyed." That was brought to pass by the 
 Goths,[19] but especially when the Turkish Empire arose almost a thousand 
 years ago,[20] then in time Asia and Africa fell away, and finally Venice 
 arose, and there remained to Rome nothing of its former power. </p>
 
<p>Now when the pope could not subdue to his arrogant will the Greeks and the 
 emperor at Constantinople, who was hereditary Roman Emperor, he bethought 
 himself of this device, viz., to rob him of his empire and his title and turn 
 it over to the Germans, who were at that time warlike and of good repute, so 
 as to bring the power of the Roman Empire under his control and give it away 
 as a fief. So too it turned out. It was taken away from the emperor at 
 Constantinople and its name and title were given to us Germans. Thereby we 
 became the servants of the pope, and there is now a second Roman Empire, which 
 the pope has built upon the Germans; for the other, which was first, has long 
 since fallen, as I have said. </p>
 
<p>So then the Roman See has its will. It has taken possession of Rome, driven 
 out the German Emperor and bound him with oaths not to dwell at Rome. He is 
 to be Roman Emperor, and yet he is not to have possession of Rome, and besides 
 he is at all times to be dependent upon the caprice of the pope and his 
 followers, so that we have the name and they have the land and cities. hey 
 have always abused our simplicity to serve their own arrogance and tyranny, 
 and they call us mad Germans, who let ourselves be made apes and fools at 
 their bidding. </p>
 
<p>Ah well! For God the Lord it is a small thing to toss empires and 
 principalities to and fro! He is so generous with then that once in a while 
 He gives a kingdom to a knave and takes it from a good man, sometimes by the 
 treachery of wicked, faithless men and sometimes by heredity, as we read of 
 the Kingdoms of Persia and Greece, and of almost all kingdoms; and Daniel 2:21 
 and 4:14 says: "He Who ruleth over all things dwelleth in heaven, and it is 
 He alone Who changeth kingdoms, tosseth them to and fro, and maketh them." 
 Since, therefore, no one can think it a great thing to have a kingdom given 
 him, especially if he is a Christian, we Germans too cannot be puffed up 
 because a new Roman Empire is bestowed on us; for in His eyes it is a trifling 
 gift, which He often gives to the most unworthy, as Daniel 4:35 says: "All who 
 dwell upon the earth are in His eyes as nothing, and He has power in all the 
 kingdoms of men, to give them to whomsoever He will." </p>
 
<p>But although the pope unjustly and by violence robbed the true emperor of his 
 Roman Empire, or of its name, and gave it to us Germans, it is certain, 
 nevertheless, that in this matter God has used the pope's wickedness to give 
 such an empire to the German nation, and after the fall of the first Roman 
 Empire, to set up another, which still exists. And although we gave no 
 occasion to this wickedness of the popes, and did not understand their false 
 aims and purposes, nevertheless, through this papal trickery and roguery, we 
 have already paid too dearly for our empire, with incalculable bloodshed, with 
 the suppression of our liberty, with the risk of robbery of all our goods, 
 especially the goods of the churches and canonries, and with the suffering of 
 unspeakable deception and insult. We have the name of the empire, but the 
 pope has our wealth, honor, body, life, soul and all that is ours. So we 
 Germans are to be cheated in the trade.[21] What the popes sought was to be 
 emperors, and since they could not manage that, they at least succeeded in 
 setting themselves over the emperors. </p>
 
<p>Because then, the empire has been given us without our fault, by the 
 providence of God and the plotting of evil men, I would not advise that we 
 give it up, but rather that we rule it wisely and in the fear of God, so long 
 as it shall please Him. For, as has been said, it matters not to Him where an 
 empire comes from; it is His will that it shall be ruled. Though the popes 
 took it dishonestly from others, nevertheless we did not get it dishonestly. 
 It is given us by the will of God through evil-minded men; and we have more 
 regard for God's will than for the treacherous purpose of the popes, who, in 
 bestowing it, wished to be emperors themselves, and more than emperors, and 
 only to fool and mock us with the name. The King of Babylon also seized his 
 empire by robbery and force; yet it was God's will that it should be ruled by 
 the holy princes, Daniel, Hananiah, Azariah and Mishael; much more then is it 
 His will that this empire be ruled by the Christian princes of Germany, 
 regardless whether the pope stole it, or got it by robbery, or made it anew. 
 It is all God's ordering, which came to pass before we knew of it. </p>
 
<p>Therefore the pope and his followers may not boast that they have done a great 
 favor to the German nation by the bestowal of this Roman Empire. First, 
 because they did not mean it for our good, but were rather taking advantage of 
 our simplicity in order to strengthen themselves in their proud designs 
 against the Roman Emperor at Constantinople, from whom the pope godlessly and 
 lawlessly took this empire, a thing which he had no right to do. Second, 
 because the pope's intention was not to give us the empire, but to get it for 
 myself, that he might bring all our power, our freedom, wealth, body and soul 
 into subjection to himself and use us (if God had not prevented) to subdue all 
 the world. He clearly says so himself in his decretals, and he has attempted 
 it, by many evil wiles, with a number of the German emperors. How beautifully 
 we Germans have been taught our German! When we thought to be lords, we 
 became slaves of the most deceitful tyrants; we have the name, title and 
 insignia of the empire, but the pope has its treasures, its authority, its law 
 and its liberty. So the pope gobbles the kernel, and we play with the empty 
 hulls. </p>
 
<p>Now may God, Who by the wiles of tyrants has tossed this empire into our lap, 
 and charged us with the ruling of it, help us to live up to the name, title 
 and insignia, to rescue our liberty, and to show the Romans, for once, what it 
 is that we, through them, have received from God! They boast that they have 
 bestowed on us an empire. So be it, then! If it is true, then let the pope 
 give us Rome and everything else which he has got from the empire; let him 
 free our land from his intolerable taxing and robbing, and give us back our 
 liberty, authority, wealth, honor, body and soul; let the empire be what an 
 empire should be, and let his words and pretensions be fulfilled! </p>
 
<p>If he will not do that, they why all this shamming, these false and lying 
 words and juggler's tricks? Is he not satisfied with having so rudely led 
 this noble nation by the nose these many hundred years without ceasing? It 
 does not follow that the pope must be above an emperor because he makes or 
 crowns him. The prophet Samuel at God's command anointed and crowned Kings 
 Saul and David, and yet he was their subject (1 Samuel 10:1; 16:13); and the 
 prophet Nathan anointed King Solomon, but was not set over him on that account 
 (1 Kings 1:38 f.); Elisha too had one of his servants anoint Jehu King of 
 Israel, and yet they remained obedient and subject to him (2 Kings 9:1 ff.). 
 Except in the case of the pope, it has never happened in all the world's 
 history that he who consecrated or crowned the king was over the king. He 
 lets himself be crowned pope by three cardinals, who are under him, and he is 
 nevertheless their superior. Why then should he, contrary to the example 
 which he himself sets, and contrary to the custom and teaching of all the 
 world and of the Scriptures, exalt himself above temporal authorities, or the 
 empire, simply because he crowns or consecrates the emperor? It is enough 
 that he should be the emperor's superior in divine things, to wit, in 
 preaching, teaching and administering the sacraments, in which things, indeed, 
 any bishop or priest is over every other man, as St. Ambrose in his See was 
 over the emperor Theodosius,[22] and the prophet Nathan over David, and 
 Samuel over Saul. Therefore, let the German Emperor be really and truly 
 emperor, and let not his authority or his sword be put down by this blind 
 pretension of papal hypocrites, as though they were to be excepted from his 
 dominion and themselves direct the temporal sword in all things. </p>
 
<p>27. Enough has now been said about the failings of the clergy, though more of 
 them can and will be found if these are properly considered. We would say 
 something too about the failings of the temporal estate. </p>

<ul> 
<p>1. There is great need of a general law and decree of the German nation 
     against the extravagance and excess in dress, by which so many nobles and 
     rich men are impoverished.[23] God has given to us, as to other lands, 
     enough wool, hair, flax and everything else which properly serves for the 
     seemly and honorable dress of every rank, so that we do not need to spend 
     and waste such enormous sums for silk and velvet and golden ornaments 
     and other foreign wares. I believe that even if the pope had not robbed us 
     Germans with his intolerable exactions, we should still have our hands 
     more than full with these domestic robbers, the silk and velvet 
     merchants.[24] In the matter of clothes, as we see, everybody wants to be 
     equal to everybody else, and pride and envy are aroused and increased 
     among us, as we deserve. All this and much more misery would be avoided 
     if our curiosity would only let us be thankful, and be satisfied with the 
     goods which God has given us. </p>
 
<p>2. In like manner it is also necessary to restrict the spice-traffic[25] 
     which is another of the great ships in which money is carried out of 
     German lands. There grows among us, by God's grace, more to eat and drink 
     than in any other land, and just as choice and good. Perhaps the proposals 
     that I make may seem foolish and impossible and give the impression that 
     I want to suppress the greatest of all trades, that of commerce; but I am 
     doing what I can. If reforms are not generally introduced, then let every 
     one who is willing reform himself. I do not see that many good customs 
     have ever come to a land through commerce, and in ancient times God make 
     His people of Israel dwell away from the sea on this account, and did not 
     let them engage much in commerce. </p>
 
<p>3. But the greatest misfortune of the German nation is certainly the 
     traffic in annuities[26]. If that did not exist many a man would have to 
     leave unbought his silk, velvets, golden ornaments, spices and ornaments 
     of every sort. It has not existed much over a hundred years, and has 
     already brought almost all princes, cities, endowed institutions, nobles 
     and their heirs to poverty, misery and ruin; if it shall continue for another 
     hundred years Germany cannot possibly have a pfennig left and we shall 
     certainly have to devour one another. The devil invented the practice, and 
     the pope, by confirming it,[27] has injured the whole world. </p>
 
<p>Therefore I ask and pray that everyone open his eyes to see the ruin of 
     himself, his children and his heirs, which not only stands before the door, 
     but already haunts the house, and that emperor, princes, lords and cities 
     do their part that this trade be condemned as speedily as possible, and 
     henceforth prevented, regardless whether or not the pope, with all his law 
     and unlaw, is opposed to it, and whether or not benefices or church 
     foundations are based upon it. It is better that there should be in a city 
     one living based on an honest freehold or revenue, than a hundred based on 
     an annuity; indeed a living based on an annuity is worse and more grievous 
     than twenty based on freeholds. In truth this traffic in rents must be a 
     sign and symbol that the world, for its grievous sins, has been sold to the 
     devil, so that both temporal and spiritual possessions must fail us, and 
     yet we do not notice it at all. </p>
 
<p>Here, too, we must put a bit in the mouth of the Fuggers and similar 
     corporations;[29] and that, too, by another way than agriculture or cattle- 
     raising, in which increase of wealth depends not on human wits, but on 
     God's blessing. I commend this to the men of affairs. I am a theologian, and 
     find nothing to blame in it except its evil and offending appearance, of 
     which St. Paul says, 1 Thess. 5:22: "Avoid every appearance or show of 
     evil." This I know well, that it would be much more pleasing to God if we 
     increased agriculture and diminished commerce, and that they do much 
     better who, according to the Scriptures, till the soil and seek their living 
     from it, as was said to us and to all men in Adam, Gen. 3:17 ff.: "Accursed 
     be the earth when thou laborest therein, it shall bear thee thistles and 
     thorns, and in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread." There is 
     still much land lying untilled. </p>
 
<p>4. Next comes the abuse of eating and drinking[30] which gives us Germans 
     a bad reputation in foreign lands, as though it were our special vice. 
     Preaching cannot stop it; it has become too common, and has got too 
     firmly the upper hand. The waste of money which it causes would be a 
     small thing, were it not followed by other sins, -- murder, adultery, 
     stealing, irreverence and all the vices. The temporal sword can do 
     something to prevent it; or else it will be as Christ says: Luke 21:34 f.: 
     "The last day shall come like a secret snare, when they shall be eating and 
     drinking, marrying and wooing, building and planting, buying and selling." 
     It is so much like that now that I verily believe the judgment day is at the 
     door, though men are thinking least of all about it. </p>
 
<p>5. Finally is it not a pitiful thing that we Christians should be maintain 
     among us open and common houses of prostitution, though all of us are 
     baptized unto chastity? I know very well what some say to this, to wit, 
     that it is not the custom of any one people, that it is hard to break up, that 
     it is better that there should be such houses than that married women, or 
     maidens, or those of more honorable estate should be outraged. But should 
     not the temporal, Christian government consider that in this heathen way 
     the evil is not to be controlled? If the people of Israel could exist without 
     such an abomination, why could not Christian people do as much? Nay, how 
     do many cities, towns and villages exist without such houses? Why should 
     not great cities exist without them? </p>
</ul>
 
<p>In this, and in the other matters above mentioned, I have tried to point out 
 how many good works the temporal government could do, and what should be the 
 duty of every government, to the end that every one may learn what an awful 
 responsibility it is to rule, and to have high station. What good would it do 
 that an overlord were in his own life as holy as St. Peter, if he have not the 
 purpose diligently to help his subjects in these matters? His very authority 
 will condemn him! For it is the duty of the authorities to seek the highest 
 good of their subjects. But if the authorities were to consider how the young 
 people might be brought together in marriage, the hope of entering the married 
 state would greatly help every one to endure and to resist temptation. </p>
 
<p>But now every man is drawn to the priesthood or the monastic life, and among 
 them, I fear, there is not one in a hundred who has any other reason than that 
 he seeks a living, and doubts that he will ever be able to support himself in 
 the estate of matrimony. Therefore they live wildly enough beforehand, and 
 wish, as they say, to "wear out their lust," but rather wear it in,[31] as 
 experience shows. I find the proverb true, "Despair makes most of the monks 
 and priests"[32]; and so things are as we see them. </p>
 
<p>My faithful counsel is that, in order to avoid many sins which have become 
 very common, neither boy nor maid should take the vow of chastity, or of the 
 "spiritual life," before the age of thirty years.[33] It is, as St. Paul 
 says, a peculiar gift. Therefore let him whom God does not 
 constrain (1 Cor. 7:7), put off becoming a cleric and taking the vows. 
Nay, I will go 
 farther and say, If you trust God so little that you are not willing to 
 support yourself as a married man, and wish to become a cleric only because of 
 this distrust, then for the sake of your own soul, I beg of you not to become 
 a cleric, but rather a farmer, or whatever else you please. For if to obtain 
 your temporal support you must have one measure of trust in God, you must have 
 ten measures of trust to continue in the life of cleric. If you do not trust 
 God to support you in the world, how will you trust him to support you in the 
 Church? Alas, unbelief and distrust spoil everything and lead us into all 
 misery, as we see in every estate of life! </p>
 
<p>Much could be said of this miserable condition. The young people have no one 
 to care for them. They all do as they please, and the government is of as 
 much use to them as if it did not exist; and yet this should be the chief 
 concern of pope, bishops, lords and councils. They wish to rule far and wide, 
 and yet to help on one. O, what a rare bird will a lord and ruler be in 
 heaven just on this account, even though he build a hundred churches for God 
 and raise up all the dead! </p>
 
<p>[Let this suffice for this time! Of what the temporal powers and the nobility 
 ought to do, I think I have said enough in the little book, <b>On Good 
Works</b>.[34] 
 There is room for improvement in their lives and in their rule, and yet 
 the abuses of the temporal power are not to be compared with those of the 
 spiritual power, as I have there shown.][35] </p>
 
<p>I think too that I have pitched my song in a high key, have made many 
 propositions which will be thought impossible and have attacked many things 
 too sharply. But what am I to do? I am in duty bound to speak. If I were 
 able, these are the things I should wish to do. I prefer the wrath of the 
 world to the wrath of God; they can do no more than take my life.[36] Many 
 times heretofore I have made overtures of peace to my opponents; but as I now 
 see, God has through them compelled me to open my mouth wider and wider and 
 give them enough to say, bark, shout and write, since they have nothing else 
 to do. Ah well, I know another little song about Rome and about them![37] If 
 their ears itch for it I will sing them that sing too, and pitch the notes to 
 the top of the scale. Understandest thou, dear Rome, what I mean? </p>
 
<p>I have many times offered my writings for investigation and judgment, but it 
 has been of no use. To be sure, I know that if my cause is just, it must be 
 condemned on earth, and approved only by Christ in heaven; for all the 
 Scriptures show that the cause of Christians and of Christendom must be judged 
 by God alone. Such a cause has never yet been approved by men on earth, but 
 the opposition has always been too great and strong. It is my greatest care 
 and fear that my cause may remain uncondemned, by which I should know for 
 certain that it was not yet pleasing to God. </p>
 
<p>Therefore let them boldly go to work, -- pope, bishop, priest, monk and 
 scholar! They are the right people to persecute the truth, as they have ever 
 done. </p>
 
<p>God give us all a Christian mind, and especially to the Christian nobility of 
 the German nation a right spiritual courage to do the best that can be done 
 for the poor Church. Amen. </p>

<p>[9] The introduction of Roman law into Germany, as the accepted law of the 
 empire, had begun in the XII Century. With the decay of the feudal system and 
 the increasing desire of the rulers to provide their government with some 
 effective legal system, its application became more widespread, until by the 
 end of the XV Century it was the accepted system of the empire. The attempt 
 to apply this ancient law to conditions utterly different from those of the 
 time when it was formulated, and the continual conflict between the Roman law, 
 the feudal customs and the remnants of Germanic legal ideas, naturally gave 
 rise to a state of affairs which Luther could justly speak of as "a 
 wilderness." </p>

<p>[18] Charles the Great, King of the Franks, was crowned Roman Emperor by Pope 
 Leo III in the year 800 AD. He was a German, but regarded himself successor 
 to the line of emperors who had ruled at Rome. The fiction was fostered by 
 the popes, and the German kings, after receiving the papal coronation, were 
 called Roman Emperors. From this came the name of the German Empire of the 
 Middle Ages, "the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation." The popes of the 
 later Middle Ages claimed that the bestowal of the imperial dignity lay in the 
 power of the pope, and Pope Clement V (1313) even claimed that in the event of 
 a vacancy the pope was the possessor of the imperial power (cf. above, p. 109). 
 On the whole subject see BRYCE, <b>Holy Roman Empire</b>, 2d ed. (1904), and 
 literature there cited. </p>

<p>[20] Luther is characteristically careless about his chronology. By the 
 "Turkish Empire" he means the Mohammed power. </p>

 Germans (Deutsche) by cheating (teuschen) them. </p>
 
<p>[22] See Cambridge <b>Mediaeval History</b>, I (1911), pp. 244 f. </p>
 
<p>[23] Such a law as Luther here suggests was proposed to the Diet of Worms 
 (1521). Text in WREDE, <b>Reichstagsakten</b>, II, 335-341. </p>
 
<p>[24] Cf. Luther's Sermon <b>von Kaufbandlung und Wuche</b> of 1524. (Weim. Ed. XV, 
 pp. 293 ff.) </p>
 
<p>[25] Spices were one of the chief articles of foreign commerce in the XVI 
 Century. The discovery of the cape-route to India had given the Portuguese a 
 practical monopoly of this trade. A comparative statement of the cost of 
 spices for a period of years was reported to the Diet of Nurnberg (1523). See 
 WREDE, op. cit., III, 576. </p>
 
<p>[26] The <b>Zinskauf</b> or <b>Rentenkauf</b> was a means for evading the prohibition of 
 usury. The buyer purchased an annuity, but the purchase price was not 
 regarded as a loan, for it could not be recalled, and the annual payments 
 could not therefore be called interest. </p>
 
<p>[27] The practice was legalized by the Lateran Council, 1512. </p>
 
<p>[28] The XVI Century was the hey-day of the great trading-companies, among 
 which the Fuggers of Augsburg (see above, p. 97, note 5) easily took first 
 place. The effort of these companies was directed toward securing monopolies 
 in the staple articles of commerce, and their ability to finance large 
 enterprises made it possible for them to gain practical control of the home 
 markets. The sharp rise in the cost of living which took place on the first 
 half of the XVI Century was laid at their door. The Diet of Cologne (1522) 
 had passed a stringent law against monopolies the subject (WREDE, 
 <b>Reichstagsakten</b>, II, pp. 355 ff.) "in somewhat heated language" (ibid., 842), 
 but failed to agree upon methods of suppression.  The subject was discussed 
 again at the Diet of Nurnberg (1523) and various remedies were proposed 
 (ibid., III, 556-599). </p>
 
<p>[29] The profits of the trading-companies were enormous. The 9 percent 
 annually of the Welser (EHRENBERG, <b>Zeitalter der Fugger</b>, I, 195), pales into 
 insignificance beside the 1634 percent by which the fortune of the Fuggers 
 grew in twenty-one years (SCHULTE, <b>Die Fugger in Rom</b>, I, 3). In 1511 a 
 certain Bartholomew Rem invested 900 gulden in the Hochstetter company of 
 Augsburg; by 1517 he claimed 33,000 gulden profit. The company was willing to 
 settle at 26,000 and the resulting litigation caused the figures to become 
 public (WREDE, op. cit., II, 842, note 4; III pp. 574 f.). On Luther's view 
 of capitalism see ECK, <b>Introduction to the Sermon von Kaufshandlung und 
 Wucher</b>, in Berl. Ed., VII, 494-513. </p>
 
<p>[30] The Diets of Augsburg (1500) and Cologne (1512) had passed edicts 
 against drunkenness. A committee of the Diet of Worms (1521) recommended 
 that these earlier edicts be reaffirmed (WREDE, op. cit., II, pp. 343f.), but 
 the Diet adjourned without acting on the recommendation (ibid., 737) Vol. 
 II-11 </p>
