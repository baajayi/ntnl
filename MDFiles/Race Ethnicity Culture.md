Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
A Social Statement on:
FREED IN CHRIST:
RACE, ETHNICITY, AND CULTURE
Adopted by a more than two-thirds majority vote as a social statement of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America by the third Churchwide Assembly on August 31, 1993, at
Kansas City, Missouri.
FACING  GOD
1.  A Time of Vision
For us as members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America there is one God and one Lord,
Jesus Christ, “ . . . through whom are all things and through whom we exist” (1 Corinthians 8:6).
Scripture speaks of one humanity, created by God.  It recounts our rebellion and enslavement to sin.
Scripture tells of a diverse people reconciled to God through the blood of the cross, a people set free
for the work of reconciliation.  It heralds a new freedom and future in one Lord, one faith, one baptism.
If the story of Babel is of a people scattered, the story of Pentecost is of a people called and gathered.
Christ 
brings 
together 
the 
scattered 
children of God (John 11:52).  The Holy Spirit breathes the freedom
of the Gospel into the Church, where every people under heaven is represented.
A humanity enslaved to sin has been set free; a Church has been gathered in freedom.  Cultural
differences still matter, but they can be seen for what God intends—blessings rather than means of
enslavement.
2.  A Time of Confession
The Church is built on the confession made by Peter (Matthew 16:13-20) and by Martha (John 11:1-
27), when they declared Jesus to be the Messiah, the Son of God.  From age to age the Church proclaims
Christ, who was crucified for our trespasses and raised for our justification (Romans 4:25).
The Church confesses Christ, who has broken down the dividing wall (Ephesians 2:14).  Christ, our
peace, has put an end to the hostility of race, ethnicity, gender, and economic class.  The Church
proclaims Christ, confident this good news sets at liberty those captive behind walls of hostility
(cf. Luke 4:18).

The Church looks toward the freedom of the reign of God, announced by and embodied in Jesus.
But Christians live between the “now” of the reign of God and the “not yet” of its fulfillment.
Trusting the promise of freedom, we can face the fact that each of us is captive, each of us is in
bondage to sin (1 John 1:8).
Therefore, we confess our sinfulness.  Because we are sinners as well as saints, we rebuild walls
broken down by Christ.  We fall back into enslaving patterns of injustice.  We betray the truth that sets
us free.  Because we are saints as well as sinners, we reach for the freedom that is ours in Christ.
3.  A Time of Commitment
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, with the whole Church, look forward to the
time when people will come from east and west, north and south to eat in the reign of God (Luke
13:29).  For the Church catholic, diversity of cultures is both a given and a glimpse of the future.
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has roots in church bodies with a strong immigrant
history.  These churches kept the faith once delivered to the saints (Jude 3) in ways appropriate
to the cultural background of their membership.  Besides preserving the faith, they furthered
mission and ministry.
The Christ to whom the Church witnesses is the Christ who breaks down walls of cultural exclusivity
(Mark 7:24-29; John 4).  We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America have recognized
ourselves to be in mission and ministry in a multicultural society, and have committed ourselves to
welcome cultural diversity.  Given our history, the commitment was neither quick nor easy.
The commitment was made, though, in these and other ways:
the goal that, within the first ten years of its existence, ten percent of this church’s
membership would be African American, Asian, Hispanic, or Native American;
the adoption of an organizational principle providing for the representation of cultural
diversity on churchwide staff and on boards and other decision-making bodies;
the creation of a Commission for Multicultural Ministries and adoption of a
Multicultural Mission Strategy;
the encouragement of African American, Asian, Hispanic, and Native American
associations; the recognition of the Slovak Zion Synod and German, Hungarian,
Finnish, and Danish special interest conferences; the regard for distinctive cultures, such
as the Appalachian culture; the assertion that deafness leads to the creation of a unique
language and culture, and a new context for ministry;
the effort to start and to support ministry in African American, Asian, Hispanic,
Native American, or multicultural settings; the effort to recognize and to empower
pastoral leaders while honoring their cultures; the effort to provide resources in
languages other than English;




the public policy advocacy at state, federal, and international levels that seeks to
eliminate racial or ethnic discrimination; the private sector advocacy that
encourages corporate social responsibility for community development;
the attention to inclusivity by seminaries, colleges, and social ministry
organizations of the church; and
the respect for cultural diversity in the work of global mission.
4.  A Time of Spiritual Crisis*
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America rejoice in our freedom in Christ Jesus.  But
we know we must persevere in our commitment to follow Christ and to serve neighbor, and live
up to our specific commitments.  While we have taken many measures fitting to a church in
mission and ministry in a multicultural society, we still falter.
We falter in what we do, or in refusing to carry out what we have promised to do.  We falter
through ignorance of what we have done or left undone.  We falter when we cling to old ideas
that prevent us from becoming the people God calls us to be.
With all Christians everywhere, members of this church live in a time of crisis (Romans 2:1 ff.).
We are torn between the freedom offered in Christ, the new Adam, and the captivity known by
the old Adam.  We are torn between becoming the people God calls us to be and remaining the
people we are, barricaded behind old walls of hostility.
The social, economic, and political dimensions of the crisis are acute, and indications of it
abound.  A burning cross reminds us that blatant acts of intimidation, hatred, and violence
continue.  A critical look reminds us of barriers that are more insidious.
The source of this many-faceted crisis, however, is profoundly spiritual.  We will rise to the crisis,
not by making a longer list of commitments, but by persisting with repentant hearts.
FACING  OBSTACLES
1.  A Time to Take Culture Seriously
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America too often react fearfully or grudgingly to the
diversity of cultures.  We are to delight in the fact that the people called, gathered, and enlightened have
such diversity.  We are, as a multicultural church, to minister in a diverse but divided society.
Culture includes music, art, and dance, but is more than that.  Culture—the attitudes and patterns of
life—plays a part in setting priorities, developing procedures, and choosing expressions of faith.
This church has not moved much beyond an “assimilation” approach to culture, where the assimilated
are those who adopt the values and behavior of the dominant culture.  This keeps us from benefitting



-4-
from the plurality of cultures already present in our church, and from appreciating the plurality
of cultures in society.
This church clearly shares the brokenness of a society that has responded to cultural diversity
through fear and efforts at assimilation.  Our society has melded many European ethnic groups
into mainstream America, but it has included people of other cultural identities only insofar as
they have taken on the values and behavior of the dominant culture.
A wall of hostility stands intact.  Captive on one side of the wall, people with access to
opportunities and institutions are largely unaware either of their own cultural biases or the
worth of other cultures.  On the other side of the wall, people scarred by slavery and other forms
of degradation and suffering have seen their cultures ridiculed and reviled, or destroyed.
2. A Time to Confront Racism
All of us sin and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23).
Racism—a mix of power, privilege, and prejudice—is sin, a violation of God’s intention for humanity.
The resulting racial, ethnic, or cultural barriers deny the truth that all people are God’s creatures and,
therefore, persons of dignity. Racism fractures and fragments both church and society.
When we speak of racism as though it were a matter of personal attitudes only, we underestimate
it. We have only begun to realize the complexity of the sin, which spreads like an infection
through the entire social system. Racism infects and affects everyone, with an impact that varies
according to race, ethnicity, or culture, and other factors such as gender or economic situation.
This church has often addressed words on racism to white members. We have done so because
our mission and ministry are in a society where white people have been favored and hold unequal
power to implement their prejudices—socially, politically, and economically. What has been the
case is still the case: skin color makes a difference and white people benefit from a privileged
position.
Racism, however, infects and affects everyone. It deforms relationships between and within
racial, ethnic, or cultural groups.  It undermines the promise of community and exacerbates
prejudice and unhealthy competition among these groups.  It robs white people of the possibility
of authentic relationships with people of color, and people of color of the possibility of authentic
relationships with white people.
Racism also can lead to the rejection of self, as when white people internalize guilt or people of
color internalize values associated with white culture. It hinders us from becoming who God calls
us to be.
When we rebuild walls of hostility and live behind them—blaming others for the problem and looking
to them for solutions—we ignore the role we ourselves play in the problem and also in the solution.
When we confront racism and move toward fairness and justice in society, all of us benefit.

3.  A Time to Be the Church
Vision breaks through brokenness.  We are one in Christ.  As the body of Christ, we are free to live
out our connectedness with each other.  Promises are kept when vision is communicated in word and
deed, and members are captured by it.  For this to happen, we need the leadership of all who have been
given responsibility and authority: members of congregations and their pastors; boards and staff of
institutions and agencies of the church; synodical bishops; and the bishop of this church.
We expect our leadership to name the sin of racism and lead us in our repentance of it.  Although
racism 
affects 
each 
one 
of 
us 
differently, 
we 
must 
take 
responsibility 
for 
our 
participation, 
acknowledge
our complicity, repent of our sin, and pray God will bring us to reconciliation.
Racism, both blatant and subtle, continues to deny the reconciling work of the cross.  God’s
forgiveness frees us from the enslavement of racism.  For some, this may mean giving up power or
privilege; for others, it may mean giving up anger or prejudice.  Let us know this reconciliation in our
lives!
We expect our leadership to persevere in their challenge to us to be in mission and ministry in a
multicultural society. The Church catholic already has diversity of cultures.  For the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America, catholicity is a given.  Members will question, however, why intentional
measures have been taken in order for us to be a multicultural church.
Because of sin and indifference, intentional measures are necessary for vision to become reality.  We
expect our leadership to clarify why measures were taken, and to help members deal with the
implications of such measures.
DOING  JUSTICE
1.  A Time for Public Leadership
Our world is one where racial and ethnic lines are drawn and enforced.  Our world is one where
hostility festers along those dividing lines, often bursting out in violence.  Our world is one
where power and prejudice combine in bitter oppression.
But God has not gathered the Church as yet one more example of brokenness.  The Church
exists to proclaim Jesus the Christ, whose life, death, and resurrection mean freedom for the
world.  The Church also exists to teach the law of God, announcing that the God who justifies
expects all people to do justice.
So, the Church must cry out for justice, and thereby resist the cynicism fueled by visions that
failed and dreams that died.  The Church must insist on justice, and thereby refuse to blame
victimized people for their situations.  The Church must insist on justice, and thereby assure
participation of all people.
The Church that pursues justice will face and address difficult social, political, and economic
problems such as:
-6-
how racism must be confronted in order to build a society where diversity is
truly valued;
how race and ethnicity figure in political decisions on immigration, crime, and
environmental pollution; and
how economic forces work against people of color in housing, medical care,
education, and employment.
In its pursuit of justice, this church must question responses that are quick, easy, and, therefore,
probably inadequate.
2.  A Time for Public Witness
The Church that confesses Christ in public demonstrates its commitment through
involvement in public life—globally and locally, nationally and in neighborhoods.
Through public events such as elections or town meetings, through public bodies such as
legislatures or volunteer groups, church members help to forge political will and consensus.
Participation in public life is essential to doing justice and undoing injustice.  Only when
people affected by racial and ethnic division speak publicly of painful realities, does there
emerge the possibility of justice for everyone.
In places served by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, however, public life is too
often in sorry shape, shallow, and fragmented.  Increasingly cynical or simply bored, many
residents ignore public debate.  Many find it difficult to participate fully because of racial or
ethnic barriers, or economic hardship.
This church, therefore, will actively promote a public life worthy of the name.  We
encourage public witness by members, and stand publicly as a church against injustice.  We
insist on a public forum accessible to everyone, since the interests of everyone are at stake.
3.  A Time for Public Deliberation
One way that we, the members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, will promote
a better public life is through example.  This church has already committed itself to a moral
deliberation that deals openly with conflict and controversy.  In fact, such deliberation has
helped us to discover new dimensions of mission and new possibilities for ministry.
This church will live up to its commitment to deliberation.  Specifically, we will:
model an honest engagement with issues of race, ethnicity and culture, by
being a community of mutual conversation, mutual correction, and mutual
consolation;
model a healthy and healing response to the change that inevitably comes
from cultural contact;





-7-
model exchanges in which people of different cultures can find points of
agreement while sometimes “agreeing to disagree;”
encourage and participate in the education of young people, in order that they
might be better equipped to live in a multicultural society;
bring together parties in conflict, creating space for deliberation; and
participate in identifying the demands of justice, and work with others who
would have justice for all.
4.  A Time for Advocacy
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America received from its predecessor church bodies a
solid foundation upon which to build advocacy for justice and opposition to racial and ethnic
discrimination.  We will listen to our advocates as we examine our own institutional life, and
will model that for which we call.
Our advocacy will take place in partnership ecumenically, among corporations and local, state,
and national governments.  We look for positive incentives for change and fair distribution of
the social costs of correcting past wrongs.  We will work for respect of cultures, for example
in mass media and public presentations, in art and advertising, and in other endeavors.  We will
speak against policy initiatives that discriminate on the basis of language.
This church will support legislation, ordinances, and resolutions that guarantee to all persons
equally:
civil rights, including full protection of the law and redress under the law of
discriminatory practices; and to all citizens, the right to vote;
access to quality education, health care, and nutrition;
opportunity for employment with fair compensation, and possibilities for job
training and education, apprenticeship, promotion, and union membership;
opportunity for business ownership;
access to legal, banking, and insurance services;
the right to rent, buy, and occupy housing in any place; and
access to public transportation and accommodation.
We of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America will advocate for just immigration policies,
including fairness in visa regulations and in admitting and protecting refugees.  We will work
for policies that cause neither undue repercussions within immigrant communities nor bias
against them.
Our efforts on behalf of local and international community and in opposition to racism will
recognize the multicultural nature of the world.  We will promote international respect for
human rights, and support the international movement to eliminate discrimination.

Addendum
Social Statements in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, adopted by the 1989
Churchwide Assembly, states that an addendum shall be added to those statements that elicit
significant division in the Churchwide Assembly.  The following amendment (at the point
indicated in the text) received support at the Churchwide Assembly but not the vote needed for
approval.
*—We 
of 
the 
ELCA 
with 
all 
Christians 
everywhere 
live 
in 
a 
time 
of 
crisis 
(Romans 
2:1ff). 
We 
are 
faced
with 
choices 
and 
decisions 
which 
mean 
success 
or 
failure, 
life 
or 
death. 
The 
Church 
cannot 
remain 
silent
while 
the 
cross, 
symbol 
of 
Christ’s 
death 
to 
set 
us 
free, 
remains 
an 
instrument 
of 
racial, 
ethnic, 
and
cultural 
hatred 
and 
evil. 
Cross 
burnings 
continue 
as 
acts 
of 
intimidation, 
hatred, 
and 
evil. 
Groups 
which
espouse 
racial, 
ethnic, 
and 
cultural 
purity 
and 
which 
foster 
acts 
of 
racial 
and 
cultural 
annihilation 
recruit
youth 
as 
well 
as 
adults. 
Ethnic 
centricity 
(racial, 
ethnic, 
and 
cultural 
purity) 
and 
economic 
instability 
give
rise 
to 
worldwide 
acts 
of 
rioting, 
hatred, 
and 
violence. 
Some 
U.S. 
corporations 
exploit 
people 
of 
color 
in
poorer 
nations 
by 
employing 
these 
people 
at 
below 
living 
wages 
to 
work 
in 
sweatshop 
conditions 
like
those 
long 
outlawed 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
while 
efforts 
at 
economic 
self-sufficiency 
by 
people 
of 
color 
in
the 
United 
States 
are 
resisted 
and 
undermined. 
Racism 
also 
creates 
identity 
and 
self-esteem 
crises 
for
children 
of 
color, 
particularly 
those 
of 
interracial 
heritage.
Christ 
calls 
upon 
us 
to 
love 
our 
neighbors 
as 
ourselves 
(Luke 
10:27). 
Christ 
does 
not 
qualify 
this 
mandate.
A 
major 
part 
of 
the 
crisis 
is 
over 
lack 
of 
experience 
or 
knowledge 
of 
those 
whose 
race, 
ethnicity, 
and
culture 
differ 
from 
our 
own.
The 
social, 
economic, 
and 
political 
dimensions 
of 
the 
crisis 
are 
acute. 
We 
consider 
the 
source 
of 
the 
crisis
to 
be 
profoundly 
spiritual. 
The 
activist 
Christ 
threw 
the 
money 
changers 
out 
of 
the 
temple. 
The 
Church
must 
continue 
to 
take 
an 
activist 
role. 
We 
must 
make 
a 
choice. 
Are 
we 
going 
to 
continue 
barricaded
behind 
old 
walls 
of 
ignorance 
and 
hostility 
or 
are 
we 
going 
to 
be 
the 
people 
God 
calls 
us 
to 
be?
