### Preface to Emperor Charles V.

1 Most Invincible Emperor, Caesar Augustus, Most Clement Lord:
Inasmuch as Your Imperial Majesty has summoned a Diet of the
Empire here at Augsburg to deliberate concerning measures against
the Turk, that most atrocious, hereditary, and ancient enemy
of the Christian name and religion, in what way, namely, effectually
to withstand his furor and assaults by strong and lasting military
provision;  2 and then also concerning dissensions in
the matter of our holy religion and Christian Faith, that in
this matter of religion the opinions and judgments of the parties
might be heard in each other’s presence; and considered and
weighed  3 among ourselves in mutual charity, leniency,
and kindness, in order that, after the removal and correction
of such things as have been treated and understood in a different
manner in the writings on either side, these matters may be
settled and brought back to one simple truth and Christian concord,
 4 that for the future one pure and true religion may
be embraced and maintained by us, that as we all are under one
Christ and do battle under Him, so we may be able also to live
in unity and concord in the one Christian Church.

And inasmuch as we, the undersigned Elector and  5 Princes,
with others joined with us, have been called to the aforesaid
Diet the same as the other Electors, Princes, and Estates, in
obedient compliance with the Imperial mandate, we have promptly
come to Augsburg, andâwhat we do not mean to say as boastingâwe
were among the first to be here.

6 Accordingly, since even here at Augsburg at the very beginning
of the Diet, Your Imperial Majesty caused to be proposed to
the Electors, Princes, and other Estates of the Empire, amongst
other things, that the several Estates of the Empire, on the
strength of the Imperial edict, should set forth and submit
their opinions and judgments in the German and the Latin  7
language, and since on the ensuing Wednesday, answer was given
to Your Imperial Majesty, after due deliberation, that we would
submit the Articles of our Confession for our side on next Wednesday,
therefore, in obedience to Your Imperial Majesty’s  8
wishes, we offer, in this matter of religion, the Confession
of our preachers and of ourselves, showing what manner of doctrine
from the Holy Scriptures and the pure Word of God has been up
to this time set forth in our lands, dukedoms, dominions, and
cities, and taught in our churches.

9 And if the other Electors, Princes, and Estates of the Empire
will, according to the said Imperial proposition, present similar
writings, to wit, in Latin and German, giving their opinions
in this  10 matter of religion, we, with the Princes
and friends aforesaid, here before Your Imperial Majesty, our
most clement Lord are prepared to confer amicably concerning
all possible ways and means, in order that we may come together,
as far as this may be honorably done, and, the matter between
us on both sides being peacefully discussed without offensive
strife, the dissension, by God’s help, may be done away and
brought back to one true accordant  11 religion; for
as we all are under one Christ and do battle under Him, we ought
to confess the one Christ, after the tenor of Your Imperial
Majesty’s edict, and everything ought to be conducted according
to the truth of God; and this it is what, with most fervent
prayers, we entreat of God.

12
However, as regards the rest of the Electors, Princes, and Estates,
who constitute the other part, if no progress should be made,
nor some result be attained by this treatment of the cause of
religion after the manner in which Your Imperial Majesty has
wisely held that it should be dealt with and treated namely,
by such mutual presentation of writings and calm conferring
together among ourselves,  13 we at least leave with
you a clear testimony, that we here in no wise are holding back
from anything that could bring about Christian concord,âsuch
as could be effected with God and a good conscience,âas
 14 also Your Imperial Majesty and, next, the other Electors
and Estates of the Empire, and all who are moved by sincere
love and zeal for religion, and who will give an impartial hearing
to this matter, will graciously deign to take notice and to
understand this from this Confession of ours and of our associates.

15
Your Imperial Majesty also, not only once but often, graciously
signified to the Electors Princes, and Estates of the Empire,
and at the Diet of Spires held A.D. 1526, according to the form
of Your Imperial instruction and commission given and prescribed,
caused it to be stated and publicly proclaimed that  16
Your Majesty, in dealing with this matter of religion, for certain
reasons which were alleged in Your Majesty’s name, was not willing
to decide and could not determine anything, but that Your Majesty
would diligently use Your Majesty’s office with the Roman Pontiff
for the convening of a General Council.  17 The same
matter was thus publicly set forth at greater length a year
ago at the last Diet which met at Spires.  18 There Your
Imperial Majesty, through His Highness Ferdinand, King of Bohemia
and Hungary, our friend and clement Lord, as well as through
the Orator and Imperial Commissioners caused this, among other
things, to be submitted: that Your Imperial Majesty had taken
notice of; and pondered, the resolution of Your Majesty’s Representative
in the Empire, and of the President and Imperial Counselors,
and the Legates from other Estates convened at Ratisbon,  19
concerning the calling of a Council, and that your Imperial
Majesty also judged it to be expedient to convene a Council;
and that Your Imperial Majesty did not doubt the Roman Pontiff
could be induced to  20 hold a General Council, because
the matters to be adjusted between Your Imperial Majesty and
the Roman Pontiff were nearing agreement and Christian reconciliation;
therefore Your Imperial Majesty himself signified that he would
endeavor to secure the said Chief Pontiff’s consent for convening,
together with your Imperial Majesty such General Council, to
be published as soon as possible by letters that were to be
sent out.

21
If the outcome, therefore, should be such that the differences
between us and the other parties in the matter of religion should
not be amicably and in charity settled, then here, before Your
Imperial Majesty we make the offer in all obedience, in addition
to what we have already done, that we will all appear and defend
our cause in such a general, free Christian Council, for the
convening of which there has always been accordant action and
agreement of votes in all the Imperial Diets held during Your
Majesty’s reign, on the part of the Electors, Princes, and other
Estates of the Empire.  22 To the assembly of this General
Council, and at the same time to Your Imperial Majesty, we have,
even before this, in due manner and form of law, addressed ourselves
and made appeal in this matter, by far the greatest and gravest.
To this  23 appeal, both to Your Imperial Majesty and
to a Council, we still adhere; neither do we intend nor would
it be possible for us, to relinquish it by this or any other
document, unless the matter between us and the other side, according
to the tenor of the latest Imperial citation should be amicably
and charitably settled, allayed, and brought to Christian concord;
 24 and regarding this we even here solemnly and publicly
testify.

### Article I. Of God.

1 Our Churches, with common consent, do teach that the decree
of the Council of Nicaea concerning the Unity of the Divine
Essence and concerning the Three Persons, is true and to be
believed without any doubting;  2 that is to say, there
is one Divine Essence which is called and which is God: eternal,
without body, without parts, of infinite power, wisdom, and
goodness, the Maker and Preserver of all things, visible and
invisible; and  3 yet there are three Persons, of the
same essence and power, who also are coeternal, the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost. And the term “person”  4 they
use as the Fathers have used it, to signify, not a part or quality
in another, but that which subsists of itself.

5
They condemn all heresies which have sprung up against this
article, as the Manichaeans, who assumed two principles, one
Good and the other Evil: also the Valentinians, Arians, Eunomians,
Mohammedans, and all such.  6 They condemn also the Samosatenes,
old and new, who, contending that there is but one Person, sophistically
and impiously argue that the Word and the Holy Ghost are not
distinct Persons, but that “Word” signifies a spoken word, and
“Spirit” signifies motion created in things.

### Article II. Of Original Sin.

1 Also they teach that since the fall of Adam all men begotten
in the natural way are born with sin, that is, without the fear
of God, without trust in God, and with  2 concupiscence;
and that this disease, or vice of origin, is truly sin, even
now condemning and bringing eternal death upon those not born
again through Baptism and the Holy Ghost.

3 They condemn the Pelagians and others who deny that original
depravity is sin, and who, to obscure the glory of Christ’s
merit and benefits, argue that man can be justified before God
by his own strength and reason.

### Article III. Of the Son of God.

1 Also they teach that the Word, that is, the Son of God, did
assume the human nature in  2 the womb of the blessed
Virgin Mary, so that there are two natures, the divine and the
human, inseparably enjoined in one Person, one Christ, true
God and true man, who was born of the Virgin Mary, truly suffered,
was crucified, dead, and  3 buried, that He might reconcile
the Father unto us, and be a sacrifice, not only for original
guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.

4 He also descended into hell, and truly rose again the third
day; afterward He ascended into heaven that He might sit on
the right hand of the Father, and forever reign and have dominion
over all creatures, and sanctify  5 them that believe
in Him, by sending the Holy Ghost into their hearts, to rule,
comfort, and quicken them, and to defend them against the devil
and the power of sin.

6 The same Christ shall openly come again to judge the quick and
the dead, etc., according to the Apostles' Creed.

### Article IV. Of Justification.

1 Also they teach that men cannot be justified before God by their
own strength, merits, or works, but are freely justified for
 2 Christ’s sake, through faith, when they believe that
they are received into favor, and that their sins are forgiven
for Christ’s sake, who, by His death, has made satisfaction
for our sins.  3 This faith God imputes for righteousness
in His sight. Rom. 3 and 4.

### Article V. Of the Ministry.

1 That we may obtain this faith, the Ministry of Teaching the
Gospel and administering the Sacraments was instituted. For
through the Word and Sacraments, as through instruments,  2
the Holy Ghost is given, who works faith; where and when it
pleases God, in them that hear  3 the Gospel, to wit,
that God, not for our own merits, but for Christ’s sake, justifies
those who believe that they are received into grace for Christ’s
sake.

4 They condemn the Anabaptists and others who think that the Holy
Ghost comes to men without the external Word, through their
own preparations and works.

### Article VI. Of New Obedience.

1 Also they teach that this faith is bound to bring forth good
fruits, and that it is necessary to do good works commanded
by God, because of God’s will, but that we should not rely on
those works to merit justification  2 before God. For
remission of sins and justification is apprehended by faith,
as also the voice of Christ attests: When ye shall have done
all these things, say: We are unprofitable servants. Luke 17:10. The same is also taught by  3 the Fathers. For Ambrose
says: It is ordained of God that he who believes in Christ is
saved, freely receiving remission of sins, without works, by
faith alone.

### Article VII. Of the Church.

1 Also they teach that one holy Church is to continue forever.
The Church is the congregation of saints, in which the Gospel
is rightly taught and the Sacraments are rightly administered.

2 And to the true unity of the Church it is enough to agree concerning
the doctrine of the Gospel and  3 the administration
of the Sacraments. Nor is it necessary that human traditions,
that is, rites or ceremonies, instituted by men, should be everywhere
alike.  4 As Paul says: One faith, one Baptism, one God
and Father of all, etc. Eph. 4:5-6.

### Article VIII. What the Church Is.

1 Although the Church properly is the congregation of saints and
true believers, nevertheless, since in this life many hypocrites
and evil persons are mingled therewith, it is lawful to use
Sacraments administered by evil men, according to the saying
of Christ: The Scribes and  2 the Pharisees sit in Moses'
seat, etc. Matt. 23:2. Both the Sacraments and Word are effectual
by reason of the institution and commandment of Christ, notwithstanding
they be administered by evil men.

3 They condemn the Donatists, and such like, who denied it to
be lawful to use the ministry of evil men in the Church, and
who thought the ministry of evil men to be unprofitable and
of none effect.

### Article IX. Of Baptism.

1 Of Baptism they teach that it is necessary  2 to salvation,
and that through Baptism is offered the grace of God, and that
children are to be baptized who, being offered to God through
Baptism are received into God’s grace.

3 They condemn the Anabaptists, who reject the baptism of children,
and say that children are saved without Baptism.

### Article X. Of the Lord's Supper.

1 Of the Supper of the Lord they teach that the Body and Blood
of Christ are truly present, and are distributed  2 to
those who eat the Supper of the Lord; and they reject those
that teach otherwise.

### Article XI. Of Confession.

1 Of Confession they teach that Private Absolution ought to be retained in the churches, although in confession  2 an enumeration of all sins is not necessary. For it is impossible according to the Psalm: Who can understand his errors? Ps. 19:12.

### Article XII. Of Repentance.

1 Of Repentance they teach that for those who have fallen after
Baptism there is remission of sins whenever they are converted
 2 and that the Church ought to impart absolution to
those thus returning to repentance. Now, repentance consists
properly of these  3 two parts: One is contrition, that
is,  4 terrors smiting the conscience through the knowledge
of sin; the other is faith, which is born of  5 the Gospel,
or of absolution, and believes that for Christ’s sake, sins
are forgiven, comforts  6 the conscience, and delivers
it from terrors. Then good works are bound to follow, which
are the fruits of repentance.

7 They condemn the Anabaptists, who deny that those once justified
can lose the Holy Ghost. Also those who contend that some may
attain to such  8 perfection in this life that they cannot
sin.

9 The Novatians also are condemned, who would not absolve such
as had fallen after Baptism, though they returned to repentance.

10 They also are rejected who do not teach that remission of sins
comes through faith but command us to merit grace through satisfactions
of our own.

### Article XIII. Of the Use of the Sacraments.

1 Of the Use of the Sacraments they teach that the Sacraments
were ordained, not only to be marks of profession among men,
but rather to be signs and testimonies of the will of God  2
toward us, instituted to awaken and confirm faith in those who
use them. Wherefore we must so use the Sacraments that faith
be added to believe the promises which are offered and set forth
through the Sacraments.

3 They therefore condemn those who teach that the Sacraments justify
by the outward act, and who do not teach that, in the use of
the Sacraments, faith which believes that sins are forgiven,
is required.

### Article XIV - Of Ecclesiastical Order.

Of Ecclesiastical Order they teach that no one should publicly
teach in the Church or administer the Sacraments unless he be
regularly called.

### Article XV. Of Ecclesiastical Usages.

1 Of Usages in the Church they teach that those ought to be observed
which may be observed without sin, and which are profitable
unto tranquillity and good order in the Church, as particular
holy days, festivals, and the like.

2 Nevertheless, concerning such things men are admonished that
consciences are not to be burdened, as though such observance
was necessary to salvation.

3 They are admonished also that human traditions instituted to
propitiate God, to merit grace, and to make satisfaction for
sins, are opposed to the Gospel and the doctrine of faith. Wherefore
vows and traditions concerning meats and  4 days, etc.,
instituted to merit grace and to make satisfaction for sins,
are useless and contrary to the Gospel.

### Article XVI. Of Civil Affairs.

1 Of Civil Affairs they teach that lawful civil ordinances are
good works of God, and that  2 it is right for Christians
to bear civil office, to sit as judges, to judge matters by
the Imperial and other existing laws, to award just punishments,
to engage in just wars, to serve as soldiers, to make legal
contracts, to hold property, to make oath when required by the
magistrates, to marry a wife, to be given in marriage.

3 They condemn the Anabaptists who forbid these civil offices
to Christians.

4 They condemn also those who do not place evangelical perfection
in the fear of God and in faith, but in forsaking civil offices,
for  5 the Gospel teaches an eternal righteousness of
the heart. Meanwhile, it does not destroy the State or the family,
but very much requires that they be preserved as ordinances
of God, and that charity be practiced in such  6 ordinances.
Therefore, Christians are necessarily bound to obey their own
magistrates  7 and laws save only when commanded to sin;
for then they ought to obey God rather than men. Acts 5:29.

### Article XVII. Of Christ's Return to Judgment.

1 Also they teach that at the Consummation of the World Christ
will appear for judgment, and  2 will raise up all the
dead; He will give to the godly and elect eternal life and everlasting
joys,  3 but ungodly men and the devils He will condemn
to be tormented without end.

4 They condemn the Anabaptists, who think that there will be an
end to the punishments of condemned men and devils.

5 They condemn also others who are now spreading certain Jewish
opinions, that before the resurrection of the dead the godly
shall take possession of the kingdom of the world, the ungodly
being everywhere suppressed.

### Article XVIII. Of Free Will.

1 Of Free Will they teach that man’s will has some liberty to
choose civil righteousness, and to work  2 things subject
to reason. But it has no power, without the Holy Ghost, to work
the righteousness of God, that is, spiritual righteousness;
since the natural man  3 receiveth not the things of
the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. 2:14; but this righteousness is wrought
in the heart when the Holy Ghost is received  4 through
the Word. These things are said in as many words by Augustine
in his Hypognosticon, Book III: We grant that all men have a
free will, free, inasmuch as it has the judgment of reason;
not that it is thereby capable, without God, either to begin,
or, at least, to complete aught in things pertaining to God,
but only in works of this life, whether good  5 or evil.
“Good” I call those works which spring from the good in nature,
such as, willing to labor in the field, to eat and drink, to
have a friend, to clothe oneself, to build a house, to marry
a wife, to raise cattle, to learn diverse useful arts, or whatsoever
good  6pertains to this life. For all of these things
are not without dependence on the providence of God; yea, of
Him and through Him they are and have their being. “Evil”  7
I call such works as willing to worship an idol, to commit murder,
etc.  8 They condemn the Pelagians and others, who teach
that without the Holy Ghost, by the power of nature alone, we
are able to love God above all things; also to do the commandments
of God as touching “the substance of the act.” For, although
nature is able in a manner to do the outward work,  9
(for it is able to keep the hands from theft and murder,) yet
it cannot produce the inward motions, such as the fear of God,
trust in God, chastity, patience, etc.

### Article XIX. Of the Cause of Sin.

Of the Cause of Sin they teach that, although God does create and
preserve nature, yet the cause of sin is the will of the wicked,
that is, of the devil and ungodly men; which will, unaided of
God, turns itself from God, as Christ says John 8:44: When
he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own.

### Article XX. Of Good Works.

1 Our teachers are falsely accused of forbidding Good Works.  2
For their published writings on the Ten Commandments, and others
of like import, bear witness that they have taught to good purpose
concerning all estates and duties of life, as to what estates
of life and what works in every calling be pleasing to God.
 3 Concerning these things preachers heretofore taught
but little, and urged only childish and needless works, as particular
holy-days, particular fasts, brotherhoods, pilgrimages, services
in honor of saints, the use of rosaries, monasticism, and such
like.  4 Since our adversaries have been admonished of
these things, they are now unlearning them, and do not preach
these unprofitable works as heretofore.  5 Besides, they
begin to mention faith, of which there was heretofore marvelous
silence.  6 They teach that we are justified not by works
only, but they conjoin faith and works, and say that we are
justified by faith and works.  7 This doctrine is more
tolerable than the former one, and can afford more consolation
than their old doctrine.

8 Forasmuch, therefore, as the doctrine concerning faith, which
ought to be the chief one in the Church, has lain so long unknown,
as all must needs grant that there was the deepest silence in
their sermons concerning the righteousness of faith, while only
the doctrine of works was treated in the churches, our teachers
have instructed the churches concerning faith as follows:â

9 First, that our works cannot reconcile God or merit forgiveness
of sins, grace, and justification, but that we obtain this only
by faith when we believe that we are received into favor for
Christ’s sake, who alone has been set forth the Mediator and
Propitiation, 1 Tim. 2:5, in order that the Father may be reconciled
through Him.  10 Whoever, therefore, trusts that by works
he merits grace, despises the merit and grace of Christ, and
seeks a way to God without Christ, by human strength, although
Christ has said of Himself: I am the Way, the Truth, and the
Life. John 14:6.

11 This doctrine concerning faith is everywhere treated by Paul,
Eph. 2:8: By grace are ye saved through faith; and that not
of your selves; it is the gift of God, not of works, etc.

12 And lest any one should craftily say that a new interpretation
of Paul has been devised by us, this entire matter is supported
by the testimonies of the Fathers. For  13 Augustine,
in many volumes, defends grace and the righteousness of faith,
over against the merits of works.  14 And Ambrose, in
his De Vocatione Gentium, and elsewhere, teaches to like effect.
For in his De Vocatione Gentium he says as follows: Redemption
by the blood of Christ would become of little value, neither
would the preeminence of man’s works be superseded by the mercy
of God, if justification, which is wrought through grace, were
due to the merits going before, so as to be, not the free gift
of a donor, but the reward due to the laborer.

15 But, although this doctrine is despised by the inexperienced,
nevertheless God-fearing and anxious consciences find by experience
that it brings the greatest consolation, because consciences
cannot be set at rest through any works, but only by faith,
when they take the sure ground that for Christ’s sake they have
a reconciled God. As Paul teaches Rom. 5:1:  16Being
justified by faith, we have peace with God.  17 This
whole doctrine is to be referred to that conflict of the terrified
conscience, neither can it be understood apart from that conflict.
Therefore  18 inexperienced and profane men judge ill
concerning this matter, who dream that Christian righteousness
is nothing but civil and philosophical righteousness.

19 Heretofore consciences were plagued with the doctrine of works,
they did not hear the consolation from the Gospel.  20
Some persons were driven by conscience into the desert, into
monasteries hoping there to merit grace by a monastic life.
 21 Some also devised other works whereby to merit grace
and make satisfaction for sins.  22 Hence there was very
great need to treat of, and renew, this doctrine of faith in
Christ, to the end that anxious consciences should not be without
consolation but that they might know that grace and forgiveness
of sins and justification are apprehended by faith in Christ.

23 Men are also admonished that here the term “faith” does not
signify merely the knowledge of the history, such as is in the
ungodly and in the devil, but signifies a faith which believes,
not merely the history, but also the effect of the historyânamely,
this article: the forgiveness of sins, to wit, that we have
grace, righteousness, and forgiveness of sins through Christ.

24 Now he that knows that he has a Father gracious to him through
Christ, truly knows God; he knows also that God cares for him,
and calls upon God; in a word, he is not  25 without
God, as the heathen. For devils and the ungodly are not able
to believe this article: the forgiveness of sins. Hence, they
hate God as an enemy, call not upon Him,  26 and expect
no good from Him. Augustine also admonishes his readers concerning
the word “faith,” and teaches that the term “faith” is accepted
in the Scriptures not for knowledge such as is in the ungodly
but for confidence which consoles and encourages the terrified
mind.

27 Furthermore, it is taught on our part that it is necessary to
do good works, not that we should trust to merit grace by them,
but because it is the will of God.  28 It is only by
faith that forgiveness of sins is apprehended, and that, for
nothing.  29 And because through faith the Holy Ghost
is received, hearts are renewed and endowed with new affections,
so as to be able to bring forth good works.  30 For Ambrose
says: Faith is the mother of a good will and right doing.  31
For man’s powers without the Holy Ghost are full of ungodly
affections, and are too weak to do works which are good in God’s
sight.  32 Besides, they are in the power of the devil
who impels men to divers sins,  33 to ungodly opinions,
to open crimes. This we may see in the philosophers, who, although
they endeavored to live an honest life could not succeed,  34
but were defiled with many open crimes. Such is the feebleness
of man when he is without faith and without the Holy Ghost,
and governs himself only by human strength.

35 Hence it may be readily seen that this doctrine is not to be
charged with prohibiting good works, but rather the more to
be commended, because it shows how we are enabled to do good
works.  36 For without faith human nature can in no wise
do the works of the First or of the Second Commandment.  37
Without faith it does not call upon God, nor expect anything
from God, nor bear the cross, but seeks, and trusts in, man’s
help.  38 And thus, when there is no faith and trust
in God all manner of lusts and human devices rule in the heart.
 39 Wherefore Christ said, John 15:5: Without Me ye
can do nothing;  40 and the Church sings:

Lacking Thy divine favor,

There is nothing found in man,

Naught in him is harmless.

### Article XXI. Of the Worship of the Saints.

1 Of the Worship of Saints they teach that the memory of saints
may be set before us, that we may follow their faith and good
works, according to our calling, as the Emperor may follow the
example of David in making war to drive away the Turk from his
country.  2 For both are kings. But the Scripture teaches
not the invocation of saints or to ask help of saints, since
it sets before us the one Christ as the Mediator, Propitiation,
High Priest, and Intercessor.  3 He is to be prayed to,
and has promised that He will hear our prayer; and this worship
He approves above all, to wit, that in all afflictions He be
called upon, 1 John 2:1:  4 If any man sin, we have
an Advocate with the Father, etc.

5 This is about the Sum of our Doctrine, in which, as can be seen,
there is nothing that varies from the Scriptures, or from the
Church Catholic, or from the Church of Rome as known from its
writers. This being the case, they judge harshly who insist
that our teachers be regarded as heretics.  6 There is,
however, disagreement on certain abuses, which have crept into
the Church without rightful authority. And even in these, if
there were some difference, there should be proper lenity on
the part of bishops to bear with us by reason of the Confession
which we have now reviewed; because even the Canons are not
so severe as to demand the same rites everywhere, neither, at
any time, have the rites of all churches been the same;  7
although, among us, in large part, the ancient rites are diligently
observed.  8 For it is a false and malicious charge that
all the ceremonies, all the things instituted of old, are abolished
in our churches.  9 But it has been a common complaint
that some abuses were connected with the ordinary rites. These,
inasmuch as they could not be approved with a good conscience,
have been to some extent corrected.

10 Inasmuch, then, as our churches dissent in no article of the
faith from the Church Catholic, but only omit some abuses which
are new, and which have been erroneously accepted by the corruption
of the times, contrary to the intent of the Canons, we pray
that Your Imperial Majesty would graciously hear both what has
been changed, and what were the reasons why the people were
not compelled to observe those abuses against their conscience.
 11 Nor should Your Imperial Majesty believe those who,
in order to excite the hatred of men against our part, disseminate
strange slanders among the people.  12 Having thus excited
the minds of good men, they have first given occasion to this
controversy, and now endeavor, by the same arts, to increase
the discord.  13 For Your Imperial Majesty will undoubtedly
find that the form of doctrine and of ceremonies with us is
not so intolerable as these ungodly and malicious men represent.
 14 Besides, the truth cannot be gathered from common
rumors or the revilings of enemies.  15 But it can readily
be judged that nothing would serve better to maintain the dignity
of ceremonies, and to nourish reverence and pious devotion among
the people than if the ceremonies were observed rightly in the
churches.

### Article XXII. Of Both Kinds in the Sacrament.

1 To the laity are given Both Kinds in the Sacrament of the Lord’s
Supper, because this usage has the commandment of the Lord in
Matt. 26:27: Drink ye all of it,  2 where Christ has
manifestly commanded concerning the cup that all should drink.
 3 And lest any man should craftily say that this refers
only to priests, Paul in 1 Cor. 11:27 recites an example from
which it appears that the whole congregation did use both kinds.
 4 And this usage has long remained in the Church, nor
is it known when, or by whose authority, it was changed; although
Cardinal Cusanus mentions the time  5 when it was approved.
Cyprian in some places testifies that the blood was given to
the people.  6 The same is testified by Jerome, who says:
The priests administer the Eucharist, and distribute the blood
of Christ to the people. Indeed, Pope Gelasius  7 commands
that the Sacrament be not divided (dist. II., De Consecratione,
cap. Comperimus).  8 Only custom, not so ancient, has
it otherwise. But it is evident  9 that any custom introduced
against the commandments of God is not to be allowed, as the
Canons witness (dist. III., cap. Veritate, and the following
chapters).  10 But this custom has been received, not
only against the Scripture, but also against the old Canons
 11 and the example of the Church. Therefore, if any
preferred to use both kinds of the Sacrament, they ought not
to have been compelled with offense to their consciences to
do otherwise. And because the division  12 of the Sacrament
does not agree with the ordinance of Christ, we are accustomed
to omit the procession, which hitherto has been in use.

### Article XXIII. Of the Marriage of Priests.

1 There has been common complaint concerning the examples of priests
who were not chaste.  2 For that reason also Pope Pius
is reported to have said that there were certain causes why
marriage was taken away from priests, but that there were far
weightier ones why it ought to be given back; for so Platina
writes.  3 Since, therefore, our priests were desirous
to avoid these open scandals, they married wives, and taught
that it was lawful for them to contract matrimony. First, because
 4 Paul says, 1 Cor. 7:2,9: To avoid fornication, let
every man have his own wife. Also: It is better to marry than
to burn. Secondly  5 Christ says, Matt. 19:11: All men
cannot receive this saying, where He teaches that not all men
are fit to lead a single life; for God created man for procreation,
Gen. 1:28.  6 Nor is it in man’s power, without a singular
gift and work of God, to alter this creation. [For it is manifest,
and many have confessed that no good, honest, chaste life, no
Christian, sincere, upright conduct has resulted (from the attempt),
but a horrible, fearful unrest and torment of conscience has
been felt by many until the end.] Therefore,  7 those
who are not fit to lead a single life ought to  8 contract
matrimony. For no man’s law, no vow, can annul the commandment
and ordinance of God. For these reasons  9 the priests
teach that it is lawful for them to marry wives.

10 It is also evident that in the ancient Church priests were married
men.  11 For Paul says, 1 Tim. 3:2, that a bishop should
be chosen who is the husband of one wife.  12 And in
Germany, four hundred years ago for the first time, the priests
were violently compelled to lead a single life, who indeed offered
such resistance that the Archbishop of Mayence, when about to
publish the Pope’s decree concerning this matter, was almost
killed in the tumult raised by the enraged priests.  13
And so harsh was the dealing in the matter that not only were
marriages forbidden for the future, but also existing marriages
were torn asunder, contrary to all laws, divine and human, contrary
even to the Canons themselves, made not only by the Popes, but
by most celebrated Synods. [Moreover, many God-fearing and intelligent
people in high station are known frequently to have expressed
misgivings that such enforced celibacy and depriving men of
marriage (which God Himself has instituted and left free to
men) has never produced any good results, but has brought on
many great and evil vices and much iniquity.]

14 Seeing also that, as the world is aging, man’s nature is gradually
growing weaker, it is well to guard that no more vices steal
into Germany.

15 Furthermore, God ordained marriage to be a help against human
infirmity.  16 The Canons themselves say that the old
rigor ought now and then, in the latter times, to be relaxed
because of the weakness of men; which it is to be wished were
done also in this matter.  17 And it is to be expected
that the churches shall at some time lack pastors if marriage
is any longer forbidden.

18 But while the commandment of God is in force, while the custom
of the Church is well known, while impure celibacy causes many
scandals, adulteries, and other crimes deserving the punishments
of just magistrates, yet it is a marvelous thing that in nothing
is more cruelty exercised than against  19 the marriage
of priests. God has given commandment to honor marriage. By
the laws of all  20 well-ordered commonwealths, even
among the heathen, marriage is most highly honored.  21
But now men, and that, priests, are cruelly put to death, contrary
to the intent of the Canons, for no other cause than  22
marriage. Paul, in 1 Tim. 4:3, calls that a doctrine of devils
which forbids marriage.  23 This may now be readily understood
when the law against marriage is maintained by such penalties.

24 But as no law of man can annul the commandment of God, so neither
can it be done by any vow.  25 Accordingly, Cyprian also
advises that women who do not keep the chastity they have promised
should marry. His words are these (Book I, Epistle XI): But
if they be unwilling or unable to persevere, it is better for
them to marry than to fall into the fire by their lusts; they
should certainly give no offense to their brethren and sisters.

26 And even the Canons show some leniency toward those who have
taken vows before the proper age, as heretofore has generally
been the case.

### Article XXIV. Of the Mass.

1 Falsely are our churches accused of abolishing the Mass; for
the Mass is retained among  2 us, and celebrated with
the highest reverence. Nearly all the usual ceremonies are also
preserved, save that the parts sung in Latin are interspersed
here and there with German hymns, which have been added  3
to teach the people. For ceremonies are needed to this end alone
that the unlearned  4 be taught [what they need to know
of Christ]. And not only has Paul commanded to use in the church
a language understood by the people 1 Cor. 14:2-9, but it
has also been so ordained by man’s law.  5 The people
are accustomed to partake of the Sacrament together, if any
be fit for it, and this also increases the reverence and devotion
of public  6 worship. For none are admitted  7
except they be first examined. The people are also advised concerning
the dignity and use of the Sacrament, how great consolation
it brings anxious consciences, that they may learn to believe
God, and to expect and ask of Him all that is good.  8
[In this connection they are also instructed regarding other
and false teachings on the Sacrament.] This worship pleases
God; such use of the Sacrament nourishes true devotion  9
toward God. It does not, therefore, appear that the Mass is
more devoutly celebrated among our adversaries than among us.

10 But it is evident that for a long time this also has been the
public and most grievous complaint of all good men that Masses
have been basely profaned and applied to purposes of lucre.
 11 For it is not unknown how far this abuse obtains
in all the churches by what manner of men Masses are said only
for fees or stipends, and how many celebrate them contrary to
the Canons.  12 But Paul severely threatens those who
deal unworthily with the Eucharist when he says, 1 Cor. 11:27: Whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the
Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the
Lord.  13 When, therefore our priests were admonished
concerning this sin, Private Masses were discontinued among
us, as scarcely any Private Masses were celebrated except for
lucre’s sake.

14 Neither were the bishops ignorant of these abuses, and if they
had corrected them in time, there would now be less dissension.
Heretofore,  15 by their own connivance, they suffered
many corruptions to creep into the Church. Now, when it is too
late, they begin to complain  16 of the troubles of the
Church, while this disturbance has been occasioned simply by
those abuses which were so manifest that they could be borne
no longer. There have been great  17 dissensions concerning
the Mass, concerning the Sacrament.  18 Perhaps the world
is being punished for such long-continued profanations of the
Mass as have been tolerated in the churches for so many centuries
by the very men who  19 were both able and in duty bound
to correct them. For in the Ten Commandments it is written,
Ex. 20:7: The Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh
His name in vain. But since  20 the world began, nothing
that God ever ordained seems to have been so abused for filthy
lucre as the Mass.

21 There was also added the opinion which infinitely increased
Private Masses, namely that Christ, by His passion, had made
satisfaction for original sin, and instituted the Mass wherein
an offering should be made for daily sins,  22 venial
and mortal. From this has arisen the common opinion that the
Mass  23 takes away the sins of the living and the dead
by the outward act. Then they began to dispute whether one Mass
said for many were worth as much as special Masses for individuals,
and this brought forth that infinite multitude of Masses. [With
this work men wished to obtain from God all that they needed,
and in the mean time faith in Christ and the true worship were
forgotten.]

24 Concerning these opinions our teachers have given warning that
they depart from the Holy Scriptures and diminish the glory
of the passion of Christ. For Christ’s passion  25 was
an oblation and satisfaction, not for original guilt only, but
also for all other sins, as it is written to the Hebrews 10:10:  26 We are sanctified through the offering of Jesus
Christ once for all. Also, Hebrews 10:14:  27By one offering
He hath perfected forever them that are sanctified. [It is an
unheard-of innovation in the Church to teach that Christ by
His death made satisfaction only for original sin and not likewise
for all other sin. Accordingly it is hoped that everybody will
understand that this error has not been reproved without due
reason.]

28 Scripture also teaches that we are justified before God through
faith in Christ, when we believe that our sins are forgiven
for Christ’s sake.  29 Now if the Mass take away the
sins of the living and the dead by the outward act justification
comes of the work of Masses, and not of faith, which Scripture
does not allow.

30 But Christ commands us, Luke 22:19: This do in remembrance
of Me; therefore the Mass was instituted that the faith of those
who use the Sacrament should remember what benefits it receives
through Christ, and cheer and comfort the anxious conscience.
For to remember Christ is to remember His benefits,  31
and to realize that they are truly offered unto us.  32
Nor is it enough only to remember the history; for this also
the Jews and the ungodly can remember.  33 Wherefore
the Mass is to be used to this end, that there the Sacrament
[Communion] may be administered to them that have need of consolation;
as Ambrose says: Because I always sin, I am always bound to
take the medicine. [Therefore this Sacrament requires faith,
and is used in vain without faith.]

34 Now, forasmuch as the Mass is such a giving of the Sacrament,
we hold one communion every holy-day, and, if any desire the
Sacrament, also on other days, when it is given to such as ask
for it.  35 And this custom is not new in the Church;
for the Fathers before Gregory make no mention of any private
Mass, but of the common Mass [the Communion] they speak very
much. Chrysostom says  36 that the priest stands daily
at the altar, inviting some  37 to the Communion and
keeping back others. And it appears from the ancient Canons
that some one celebrated the Mass from whom all the other presbyters
and deacons received the body of he Lord; for thus  38
the words of the Nicene Canon say: Let the deacons, according
to their order, receive the Holy Communion after the presbyters,
from the bishop or from a presbyter.  39 And Paul, 1
Cor. 11:33, commands concerning the Communion: Tarry one for
another, so that there may be a common participation.

40 Forasmuch, therefore, as the Mass with us has the example of
the Church, taken from the Scripture and the Fathers, we are
confident that it cannot be disapproved, especially since public
ceremonies, for the most part like those hither to in use, are
retained; only the number of Masses differs, which, because
of very great and manifest abuses doubtless might be profitably
reduced.  41 For in olden times, even in churches most
frequented, the Mass was not celebrated every day, as the Tripartite
History (Book 9, chap. 33) testifies: Again in Alexandria, every
Wednesday and Friday the Scriptures are read, and the doctors
expound them, and all things are done, except the solemn rite
of Communion.

### Article XXV. Of Confession.

1 Confession in the churches is not abolished among us; for it
is not usual to give the body of the Lord, except to them that
have been previously examined and absolved. And  2 the
people are most carefully taught concerning faith in the absolution,
about which formerly there  3 was profound silence. Our
people are taught that they should highly prize the absolution,
as being the voice of God,  4 and pronounced by God’s
command. The power of the Keys is set forth in its beauty and
they are reminded what great consolation it brings to anxious
consciences, also, that God requires faith to believe such absolution
as a voice sounding from heaven, and that such faith in Christ
truly obtains and receives the forgiveness of sins. Aforetime
satisfactions were immoderately extolled;  5 of faith
and the merit of Christ and the righteousness of faith no mention
was made; wherefore, on this point, our churches are by no means
to be blamed. For this even our adversaries must needs concede
 6 to us that the doctrine concerning repentance has
been most diligently treated and laid open by our teachers.

7 But of Confession they teach that an enumeration of sins is
not necessary, and that consciences be not burdened with anxiety
to enumerate all sins, for it is impossible to recount all sins,
as the Psalm 19:13 testifies: Who can understand his errors?
Also Jeremiah 17:9 :  8 The heart is deceitful; who
can know it? But if no sins were forgiven, except those that
are recounted,  9 consciences could never find peace;
for very many sins they neither see  10 nor can remember.
The ancient writers also testify that an enumeration is not
necessary. For in the Decrees, Chrysostom is quoted,  11
who says thus: I say not to you that you should disclose yourself
in public, nor that you accuse yourself before others, but I
would have you obey the prophet who says: “Disclose thy way
before God.” Therefore confess your sins before God, the true
Judge, with prayer. Tell your errors, not with the tongue, but
with the memory of your conscience, etc.  12 And the
Gloss (Of Repentance, Distinct. V, Cap. Consideret) admits that
Confession is of human right only [not commanded by Scripture,
but ordained by the Church].  13 Nevertheless, on account
of the great benefit of absolution, and because it is otherwise
useful to the conscience, Confession is retained among us.

### Article XXVI. Of the Distinction of Meats.

1 It has been the general persuasion, not of the people alone,
but also of those teaching in the churches, that making Distinctions
of Meats, and like traditions of men, are works profitable to
merit grace, and able to make satisfactions for sins. And that
 2 the world so thought, appears from this, that new
ceremonies, new orders, new holy-days, and new fastings were
daily instituted, and the teachers in the churches did exact
these works as a service necessary to merit grace, and did greatly
terrify men’s consciences, if they should omit any of these
things.  3 From this persuasion concerning traditions
much detriment has resulted in the Church.

4 First, the doctrine of grace and of the righteousness of faith
has been obscured by it, which is the chief part of the Gospel,
and ought to stand out as the most prominent in the Church,
in order that the merit of Christ may be well known, and faith,
which believes that sins are forgiven for Christ’s sake be exalted
far above works. Wherefore Paul also lays  5 the greatest
stress on this article, putting aside the Law and human traditions,
in order to show that Christian righteousness is something else
than such works, to wit, the faith which believes that sins
 6 are freely forgiven for Christ’s sake. But this doctrine
of Paul has been almost wholly smothered by traditions, which
have produced an opinion that, by making distinctions in meats
and like services,  7 we must merit grace and righteousness.
In treating of repentance, there was no mention made of faith;
only those works of satisfaction were set forth; in these the
entire repentance seemed to consist.

8 Secondly, these traditions have obscured the commandments of
God, because traditions were placed far above the commandments
of God. Christianity was thought to consist wholly in the observance
of certain holy-days, rites, fasts, and vestures. These  9
observances had won for themselves the exalted title of being
the spiritual life and the perfect life. Meanwhile the commandments
of God, according to  10 each one’s calling, were without
honor namely, that the father brought up his offspring, that
the mother bore children, that the prince governed the commonwealth,âthese
were accounted works that were worldly and imperfect, and far
below those glittering observances. And this error greatly tormented
 11 devout consciences, which grieved that they were
held in an imperfect state of life, as in marriage, in the office
of magistrate; or in other civil ministrations; on the other
hand, they admired the monks and such like, and falsely imagined
that the observances of such men were more acceptable to God.

12 Thirdly, traditions brought great danger to consciences; for
it was impossible to keep all traditions, and yet men judged
these observances to be necessary acts of worship. Gerson writes
that many fell  13 into despair, and that some even took
their own lives, because they felt that they were not able to
satisfy the traditions, and they had all the while not heard
any consolation of the righteousness of faith and  14
grace. We see that the summists and theologians gather the traditions,
and seek mitigations whereby to ease consciences, and yet they
do not sufficiently unfetter, but sometimes entangle, consciences
even more.  15 And with the gathering of these traditions,
the schools and sermons have been so much occupied that they
have had no leisure to touch upon Scripture, and to seek the
more profitable doctrine of faith, of the cross, of hope, of
the dignity of civil affairs of consolation of sorely tried
consciences.  16 Hence Gerson and some other theologians
have grievously complained that by these strivings concerning
traditions they were prevented from giving attention to a better
kind of doctrine. Augustine also forbids that men’s consciences
should be burdened  17 with such observances, and prudently
advises Januarius that he must know that they are to be observed
as things indifferent; for such are his words.

18 Wherefore our teachers must not be looked upon as having taken
up this matter rashly or from hatred of the bishops,  19
as some falsely suspect. There was great need to warn the churches
of these errors, which had arisen from misunderstanding the
traditions.  20 For the Gospel compels us to insist in
the churches upon the doctrine of grace, and of the righteousness
of faith; which, however, cannot be understood, if men think
that they merit grace by observances of their own choice.

21 Thus, therefore, they have taught that by the observance of
human traditions we cannot merit grace or be justified, and
hence we must not think such observances necessary acts of worship.
 22 They add hereunto testimonies of Scripture. Christ,
Matt. 15:3, defends the Apostles who had not observed the usual
tradition, which, however, evidently pertains to a matter not
unlawful, but indifferent, and to have a certain affinity with
the purifications of the Law, and says, Matt. 15:9, In vain do they
worship Me with the commandments of men.  23 He, therefore,
does not exact an unprofitable service. Shortly after He adds:
Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man. So also
Paul, Rom. 14:17:  24The kingdom of God is not meat
and drink.  25 Col. 2:16: Let no man, therefore, judge
you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy-day, or of
the Sabbath-day; also: If  26ye be dead with Christ from
the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world,
are ye subject to ordinances: Touch not, taste not, handle not!
And Peter says, Acts 15:10: Why  27 tempt ye God to
put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our
fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through
the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ  28 we shall be saved,
even as they. Here Peter forbids to burden the consciences with
many rites,  29 either of Moses or of others. And in
1 Tim. 4:1,3 Paul calls the prohibition of meats a doctrine
of devils; for it is against the Gospel to institute or to do
such works that by them we may merit grace, or as though Christianity
could not exist without such service of God.

30 Here our adversaries object that our teachers are opposed to
discipline and mortification of the flesh, as Jovinian. But
the contrary may be learned  31 from the writings of
our teachers. For they have always taught concerning the cross
that it behooves Christians to bear afflictions. This is the
true,  32 earnest, and unfeigned mortification, to wit,
to be exercised with divers afflictions, and to be crucified
with Christ.

33 Moreover, they teach that every Christian ought to train and
subdue himself with bodily restraints, or bodily exercises and
labors that neither satiety nor slothfulness tempt him to sin,
but not that we may merit grace or make satisfaction for sins
by such exercises.  34 And such external discipline ought
to be urged at all times, not only on a few and set days. So
Christ commands,  35 Luke 21:34: Take heed lest your
hearts  36 be overcharged with surfeiting; also Matt.
17:21: This kind goeth not out but  37 by prayer and
fasting. Paul also says, 1 Cor. 9:27: I keep under my body
and bring it into subjection.  38 Here he clearly shows
that he was keeping under his body, not to merit forgiveness
of sins by that discipline, but to have his body in subjection
and fitted for spiritual things, and for the discharge of duty
according  39 to his calling. Therefore, we do not condemn
fasting in itself, but the traditions which prescribe certain
days and certain meats, with peril of conscience, as though
such works were a necessary service.

40 Nevertheless, very many traditions are kept on our part, which
conduce to good order in the Church, as the Order of Lessons
 41 in the Mass and the chief holy-days. But, at the
same time, men are warned that such observances do not justify
before God, and that in such things it should not be made sin
if they be omitted without offense.  42 Such liberty
in human rites was not unknown to the Fathers.  43 For
in the East they kept Easter at another time than at Rome, and
when, on account of this diversity, the Romans accused the Eastern
Church of schism, they were admonished by others  44
that such usages need not be alike everywhere. And Irenaeus
says: Diversity concerning fasting does not destroy the harmony
of faith; as also Pope Gregory intimates in Dist. XII, that
such diversity does not violate the unity of the Church.  45
And in the Tripartite History, Book 9, many examples of dissimilar
rites are gathered, and the following statement is made: It
was not the mind of the Apostles to enact rules concerning holy-days,
but to preach godliness and a holy life [to teach faith and
love].

### Article XXVII. Of Monastic Vows.

1 What is taught on our part concerning Monastic Vows, will be
better understood if it be remembered what has been the state
of the monasteries, and how many things were daily done in those
very monasteries, contrary to the Canons.  2 In Augustine’s
time they were free associations. Afterward, when discipline
was corrupted, vows were everywhere added for the purpose of
restoring discipline, as in a carefully planned prison.

3 Gradually, many other observances were added besides vows.  4
And these fetters were laid upon many before the lawful age,
contrary to the Canons.

5 Many also entered into this kind of life through ignorance,
being unable to judge their own strength, though they were of
sufficient age.  6 Being thus ensnared, they were compelled
to remain, even though some could have been freed by the kind
provision of the Canons.  7 And this was more the case
in convents of women than of monks, although more consideration
should have been shown the weaker sex.  8 This rigor
displeased many good men before this time, who saw that young
men and maidens were thrown into convents for a living. They
saw what unfortunate results came of this procedure, and what
scandals were created, what snares were cast upon consciences!
They were grieved  9 that the authority of the Canons
in so momentous a matter was utterly set aside and despised.
To  10 these evils was added such a persuasion concerning
vows as, it is well known, in former times displeased even those
monks who were more considerate.  11 They taught that
vows were equal to Baptism; they taught that by this kind of
life they merited forgiveness of sins and justification before
God.  12 Yea, they added that the monastic life not only
merited righteousness before God but even greater things, because
it kept not only the precepts, but also the so-called “evangelical
counsels.”

13 Thus they made men believe that the profession of monasticism
was far better than Baptism, and that the monastic life was
more meritorious than that of magistrates, than the life of
pastors, and such like, who serve their calling in accordance
with God’s commands, without any man-made services.  14
None of these things can be denied; for they appear in their
own books. [Moreover, a person who has been thus ensnared and
has entered a monastery learns little of Christ.]

15 What, then, came to pass in the monasteries? Aforetime they
were schools of theology and other branches, profitable to the
Church; and thence pastors and bishops were obtained. Now it
is another thing. It is needless to rehearse what is known to
all.  16 Aforetime they came together to learn; now they
feign that it is a kind of life instituted to merit grace and
righteousness; yea, they preach that it is a state of perfection,
and they put it far above all other kinds of life ordained of
God.  17 These things we have rehearsed without odious
exaggeration, to the end that the doctrine of our teachers
on this point might be better understood.

18 First, concerning such as contract matrimony, they teach on
our part that it is lawful for all men who are not fitted for
single life to contract matrimony, because vows cannot annul
the ordinance and commandment of God.  19 But the commandment
of God is 1 Cor. 7:2: To avoid fornication, let every man have
 20 his own wife. Nor is it the commandment only, but
also the creation and ordinance of God, which forces those to
marry who are not excepted by a singular work of God, according
to the text Gen. 2:18: It is not good  21that the man
should be alone. Therefore they do not sin who obey this commandment
and ordinance of God.

22 What objection can be raised to this? Let men extol the obligation
of a vow as much as they list, yet shall they not bring to pass
that the vow  23 annuls the commandment of God. The Canons
teach that the right of the superior is excepted in every vow;
[that vows are not binding against the decision of the Pope;]
much less, therefore, are these vows of force which are against
the commandments of God.

24 Now, if the obligation of vows could not be changed for any
cause whatever, the Roman Pontiffs could never have given dispensation
for it is not lawful for man to annul an obligation which is
simply  25 divine. But the Roman Pontiffs have prudently
judged that leniency is to be observed in this obligation, and
therefore  26 we read that many times they have dispensed
from vows. The case of the King of Aragon who was called back
from the monastery is well known, and there are also examples
in our own times. [Now, if dispensations have been granted for
the sake of securing temporal interests, it is much more proper
that they be granted on account of the distress of souls.]

27 In the second place, why do our adversaries exaggerate the obligation
or effect of a vow when, at the same time, they have not a word
to say of the nature of the vow itself, that it ought to be
in a thing possible, that it ought to be free,  28 and
chosen spontaneously and deliberately? But it is not unknown
to what extent perpetual chastity is in the power of man.  29
And how few are there who have taken the vow spontaneously and
deliberately! Young maidens and men, before they are able to
judge, are persuaded, and sometimes even compelled, to take
the vow. Wherefore  30 it is not fair to insist so rigorously
on the obligation, since it is granted by all that it is against
the nature of a vow to take it without spontaneous and deliberate
action.

31 Most canonical laws rescind vows made before the age of fifteen;
for before that age there does not seem sufficient judgment
in a person to decide concerning a perpetual life.  32
Another Canon, granting more to the weakness of man, adds a
few years; for it forbids a vow to be made before the age of
eighteen.  33 But which of these two Canons shall we
follow? The most part have an excuse for leaving the monasteries,
because most of them have taken the vows before they reached
these ages.

34 Finally, even though the violation of a vow might be censured,
yet it seems not forthwith to follow that the marriages of such
persons must be dissolved.  35 For Augustine denies that
they ought to be dissolved (XXVII. Quaest. I, Cap. Nuptiarum),
and his authority is not lightly to be esteemed, although other
men afterwards thought otherwise.

36 But although it appears that God’s command concerning marriage
delivers very many from their vows, yet our teachers introduce
also another argument concerning vows to show that they are
void. For every service of God, ordained and chosen of men without
the commandment of God to merit justification and grace, is
wicked, as Christ says Matt. 15:9:  37In vain do they
worship Me with the commandments of men. And Paul teaches everywhere
that righteousness is not to be sought from our own observances
and acts of worship, devised by men, but that it comes by faith
to those who believe that they are received by God into grace
for Christ’s sake.

38 But it is evident that monks have taught that services of man’s
making satisfy for sins and merit grace and justification. What
else is this than to detract from the glory of Christ and to
obscure and deny the righteousness of faith?  39 It follows,
therefore, that the vows thus commonly taken have been wicked
services, and, consequently, are void.  40 For a wicked vow, taken
against the commandment of God, is not valid; for (as the Canon
says) no vow ought to bind men to wickedness.

41 Paul says, Gal. 5:4: Christ is become of no effect unto you,
whosoever of you are justified by the Law, ye are fallen from
grace.  42 To those, therefore, who want to be justified
by their vows Christ is made of no effect, and they fall from
grace.  43 For also these who ascribe justification to
vows ascribe to their own works that which properly belongs
to the glory of Christ.

44 Nor can it be denied, indeed, that the monks have taught that,
by their vows and observances, they were justified, and merited
forgiveness of sins, yea, they invented still greater absurdities,
saying  45 that they could give others a share in their
works. If any one should be inclined to enlarge on these things
with evil intent, how many things could he bring together whereof
even the monks are now ashamed!  46 Over and above this,
they persuaded men that services of man’s making were a state
of Christian perfection.  47 And is not this assigning
justification to works?  48 It is no light offense in
the Church to set forth to the people a service devised by men,
without the commandment of God, and to teach that such service
justifies men. For the righteousness of faith, which chiefly
ought to be taught in the Church, is obscured when these wonderful
angelic forms of worship, with their show of poverty, humility,
and celibacy, are cast before the eyes of men.

49 Furthermore, the precepts of God and the true service of God
are obscured when men hear that only monks are in a state of
perfection. For Christian perfection is to fear God from the
heart, and yet to conceive great faith, and to trust that for
Christ’s sake we have a God who has been reconciled, to ask
of God, and assuredly to expect His aid in all things that,
according to our calling, are to be done; and meanwhile, to
be diligent in outward good works,  50 and to serve our
calling. In these things consist the true perfection and the
true service of God. It does not consist in celibacy, or in
begging, or in vile apparel.  51 But the people conceive
many pernicious opinions from the false commendations of monastic
life.  52 They hear celibacy praised above measure; therefore
they lead their married life with offense to their consciences.
 53 They hear that only beggars are perfect; therefore
they keep their possessions and do business with offense to
their consciences.  54 They hear that it is an evangelical
counsel not to seek revenge; therefore some in private life
are not afraid to take revenge, for they hear that it is but
a counsel, and  55 not a commandment. Others judge that
the Christian cannot properly hold a civil office or be a magistrate.

56 There are on record examples of men who, forsaking marriage
and the administration of the Commonwealth, have hid themselves
in monasteries. This  57 they called fleeing from the
world, and seeking a kind of life which would be more pleasing
to God. Neither did they see that God ought to be served in
those commandments which He Himself has given and not in commandments
 58 devised by men. A good and perfect kind of life is
that which has for it the commandment of God.  59 It
is necessary to admonish men of these things.

60 And before these times, Gerson rebukes this error of the monks
concerning perfection, and testifies that in his day it was
a new saying that the monastic life is a state of perfection.

61 So many wicked opinions are inherent in the vows, namely, that
they justify, that they constitute Christian perfection, that
they keep the counsels and commandments, that they have works
of supererogation. All these things, since they are false and
empty, make vows null and void.

### Article XXVIII. Of Ecclesiastical Power.

1 There has been great controversy concerning the Power of Bishops,
in which some have awkwardly confounded the power of the Church
 2 and the power of the sword. And from this confusion
very great wars and tumults have resulted, while the Pontiffs,
emboldened by the power of the Keys, not only have instituted
new services and burdened consciences with reservation of cases
and ruthless excommunications, but have also undertaken to transfer
the kingdoms of this world,  3 and to take the Empire
from the Emperor. These wrongs have long since been rebuked
in the Church  4 by learned and godly men. Therefore
our teachers, for the comforting of men’s consciences, were
constrained to show the difference between the power of the
Church and the power of the sword, and taught that both of them,
because of God’s commandment, are to be held in reverence and
honor, as the chief blessings of God on earth.

5 But this is their opinion, that the power of the Keys, or the
power of the bishops, according to the Gospel, is a power or
commandment of God, to preach the Gospel, to remit and retain
sins, and to administer Sacraments.  6 For with this
commandment Christ sends forth His Apostles, John 20:21 sqq.:
As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you. Receive ye the
Holy Ghost. Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto
them; and whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.  7
Mark 16:15: Go preach the Gospel to every creature.

8 This power is exercised only by teaching or preaching the Gospel
and administering the Sacraments, according to their calling
either to many or to individuals. For thereby are granted, not
bodily, but eternal things, as eternal righteousness, the Holy
Ghost, eternal life.  9 These things cannot come but
by the ministry of the Word and the Sacraments, as Paul says,
Rom. 1:16: The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to
every one that believeth.  10 Therefore, since the power
of the Church grants eternal things, and is exercised only by
the ministry of the Word, it does not interfere with civil government;
no more than the art of singing interferes with civil government.
 11 For civil government deals with other things than
does the Gospel. The civil rulers defend not minds, but bodies
and bodily things against manifest injuries, and restrain men
with the sword and bodily punishments in order to preserve civil
justice and peace.

12 Therefore the power of the Church and the civil power must not
be confounded. The power of the Church has its own commission
to teach the Gospel and  13 to administer the Sacraments.
Let it not break into the office of another; let it not transfer
the kingdoms of this world; let it not abrogate the laws of
civil rulers; let it not abolish lawful obedience; let it not
interfere with judgments concerning civil ordinances or contracts;
let it not prescribe laws to civil rulers concerning the form
of the Commonwealth.  14 As Christ says, John 18:36:
My kingdom is not of this world;  15 also Luke 12:14:
Who made Me a judge or a divider over you?  16 Paul also
says, Phil. 3:20: Our citizenship is in heaven;  17
2 Cor. 10:4: The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but
mighty through God to the casting down of imaginations.

18 After this manner our teachers discriminate between the duties
of both these powers, and command that both be honored and acknowledged
as gifts and blessings of God.

19 If bishops have any power of the sword, that power they have,
not as bishops, by the commission of the Gospel, but by human
law having received it of kings and emperors for the civil administration
of what is theirs. This, however, is another office than the
ministry of the Gospel.

20 When, therefore, the question is concerning the jurisdiction
of bishops, civil authority must be distinguished from  21
ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Again, according to the Gospel
or, as they say, by divine right, there belongs to the bishops
as bishops, that is, to those to whom has been committed the
ministry of the Word and the Sacraments, no jurisdiction except
to forgive sins, to judge doctrine, to reject doctrines contrary
to the Gospel, and to exclude from the communion of the Church
wicked men, whose wickedness is known, and this without human
force,  22 simply by the Word. Herein the congregations
of necessity and by divine right must obey them, according to
Luke 10:16: He that heareth you heareth Me.  23 But
when they teach or ordain anything against the Gospel, then
the congregations have a commandment of God prohibiting obedience,
Matt. 7:15: Beware of false prophets;  24 Gal. 1:8:
Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel, let him
be accursed;  25 2 Cor. 13:8: We can do nothing against
the truth, but for the truth.  26 Also: The power which
the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.
 27 So, also, the Canonical Laws command (II. Q. VII.
Cap., Sacerdotes, and Cap. Oves).  28 And Augustine (Contra
Petiliani Epistolam): Neither must we submit to Catholic bishops
if they chance to err, or hold anything contrary to the Canonical
Scriptures of God.

29 If they have any other power or jurisdiction, in hearing and
judging certain cases, as of matrimony or of tithes, etc., they
have it by human right, in which matters princes are bound,
even against their will, when the ordinaries fail, to dispense
justice to their subjects for the maintenance of peace.  30
Moreover, it is disputed whether bishops or pastors have the
right to introduce ceremonies in the Church, and to make laws
concerning meats, holy-days and grades, that is, orders of ministers,
etc.  31 They that give this right to the bishops refer
to this testimony John 16:12-13: I have yet many things to
say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when He,
the Spirit of Truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth.
 32 They also refer to the example of the Apostles, who
commanded to abstain from blood and from things strangled, Acts
15:29.  33 They refer to the Sabbath-day as having been
changed into the Lord’s Day, contrary to the Decalog, as it
seems. Neither is there any example whereof they make more than
concerning the changing of the Sabbath-day. Great, say they,
is the power of the Church, since it has dispensed with one
of the Ten Commandments!

34 But concerning this question it is taught on our part (as has
been shown above) that bishops have no power to decree anything
against the Gospel. The Canonical Laws teach the same thing
(Dist. IX).  35 Now, it is against Scripture to establish
or require the observance of any traditions, to the end that
by such observance we may make satisfaction for sins, or merit
grace and righteousness.  36 For the glory of Christ’s
merit suffers injury when, by such observances,  37 we
undertake to merit justification. But it is manifest that, by
such belief, traditions have almost infinitely multiplied in
the Church, the doctrine concerning faith and the righteousness
of faith being meanwhile suppressed. For gradually more holy-days
were made, fasts appointed, new ceremonies and services in honor
of saints instituted, because the authors of such things thought
that by these works they were meriting  38 grace. Thus
in times past the Penitential Canons increased, whereof we still
see some traces in the satisfactions.

39 Again, the authors of traditions do contrary to the command
of God when they find matters of sin in foods, in days, and
like things, and burden the Church with bondage of the law,
as if there ought to be among Christians, in order to merit
justification a service like the Levitical, the arrangement
of which God had committed to the Apostles and bishops.  40
For thus some of them write; and the Pontiffs in some measure
seem to be misled by the example  41 of the law of Moses.
Hence are such burdens, as that they make it mortal sin, even
without offense to others, to do manual labor on holy-days,
a mortal sin to omit the Canonical Hours, that certain foods
defile the conscience that fastings are works which appease
God that sin in a reserved case cannot be forgiven but by the
authority of him who reserved it; whereas the Canons themselves
speak only of the reserving of the ecclesiastical penalty, and
not of the reserving of the guilt.

42 Whence have the bishops the right to lay these traditions upon
the Church for the ensnaring of consciences, when Peter, Acts
15:10, forbids to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples,
and Paul says, 2 Cor. 13:10, that the power given him was to
edification not to destruction? Why, therefore, do they increase
sins by these traditions?

43 But there are clear testimonies which prohibit the making of
such traditions, as though they merited grace or were necessary
to  44 salvation. Paul says, Col. 2:16-23: Let no man
judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy-day,
or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath-days.  45 If ye
be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as
though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances (touch
not; taste not; handle not, which all are to perish with the
using) after the commandments and doctrines of men! which things
have indeed a show of wisdom.  46 Also in Titus 1:14
he openly forbids traditions: Not giving heed to Jewish fables
and commandments of men that turn from the truth.

47 And Christ, Matt. 15:14,13, says of those who require traditions:
Let them alone; they be blind leaders of the blind;  48
and He rejects such services: Every plant which My heavenly
Father hath not planted shall be plucked up.

49 If bishops have the right to burden churches with infinite traditions,
and to ensnare consciences, why does Scripture so often prohibit
to make, and to listen to, traditions? Why does it call them
“doctrines of devils”? 1 Tim. 4:1. Did the Holy Ghost in vain
forewarn of these things?

50 Since, therefore, ordinances instituted as things necessary,
or with an opinion of meriting grace, are contrary to the Gospel,
it follows that it is not lawful for any bishop  51 to
institute or exact such services. For it is necessary that the
doctrine of Christian liberty be preserved in the churches,
namely, that the bondage of the Law is not necessary to justification,
as it is written in the Epistle to the Galatians 5:1: Be not
entangled again with the yoke of bondage.  52 It is necessary
that the chief article of the Gospel be preserved, to wit, that
we obtain grace freely by faith in Christ, and not for certain
observances or acts of worship devised by men.

53 What, then, are we to think of the Sunday and like rites in
the house of God? To this we answer that it is lawful for bishops
or pastors to make ordinances that things be done orderly in
the Church, not that thereby we should merit grace or make satisfaction
for sins, or that consciences be bound to judge them necessary
services, and to think that it is a sin to break them  54
without offense to others. So Paul ordains, 1 Cor. 11:5, that
women should cover their heads in the congregation, 1 Cor. 14:30, that interpreters be heard in order in the church, etc.

55 It is proper that the churches should keep such ordinances for
the sake of love and tranquillity, so far that one do not offend
another, that all things be done in the churches in order, and
without confusion, 1 Cor. 14:40; comp. Phil. 2:14 .  56
but so that consciences be not burdened to think that they are
necessary to salvation, or to judge that they sin when they
break them without offense to others; as no one will say that
a woman sins who goes out in public with her head uncovered
provided only that no offense be given.

57 Of this kind is the observance of the Lord’s Day, Easter, Pentecost,
and like holy-days and  58 rites. For those who judge
that by the authority of the Church the observance of the Lord’s
Day instead of the Sabbath-day was ordained as a thing necessary,
 59 do greatly err. Scripture has abrogated the Sabbath-day;
for it teaches that, since the Gospel has been revealed, all
the ceremonies of Moses can be omitted. And  60 yet,
because it was necessary to appoint a certain day, that the
people might know when they ought to come together, it appears
that the Church designated the Lord’s Day for this purpose;
and this day seems to have been chosen all the more for this
additional reason, that men might have an example of Christian
liberty, and might know that the keeping neither of the Sabbath
nor of any other day is necessary.

61 There are monstrous disputations concerning the changing of
the law, the ceremonies of the new law, the changing of the
Sabbath-day, which all have sprung from the false belief that
there must needs be in the Church a service like to the Levitical,
and that Christ had given commission to the Apostles and bishops
to devise new ceremonies as necessary to  62 salvation.
These errors crept into the Church when the righteousness of
faith was not taught clearly enough.  63 Some dispute
that the keeping of the Lord’s Day is not indeed of divine right,
but in a manner so. They prescribe concerning holy-days, how
far it is lawful to work. What else  64 are such disputations
than snares of consciences? For although they endeavor to modify
the traditions, yet the mitigation can never be perceived as
long as the opinion remains that they are necessary, which must
needs remain where the righteousness of faith and Christian
liberty are not known.

65 The Apostles commanded Acts 15:20 to abstain from blood. Who
does now observe it? And yet they that do it not sin not; for
not even the Apostles themselves wanted to burden consciences
with such bondage; but they forbade it for a time, to avoid
offense.  66 For in this decree we must perpetually consider
what the aim of the Gospel is.

67 Scarcely any Canons are kept with exactness, and from day to
day many go out of use even among those who are the most zealous
advocates of traditions.  68 Neither can due regard be
paid to consciences unless this mitigation be observed, that
we know that the Canons are kept without holding them to be
necessary, and that no harm is done consciences, even though
traditions go out of use.

69 But the bishops might easily retain the lawful obedience of
the people if they would not insist upon the observance of such
traditions as cannot be kept with a good conscience.  70
Now they command celibacy; they admit none unless they swear
that they will not teach  71 the pure doctrine of the
Gospel. The churches do not ask that the bishops should restore
concord at the expense of their honor; which, nevertheless,
 72 it would be proper for good pastors to do. They ask
only that they would release unjust burdens which are new and
have been received contrary to the custom of the Church Catholic.
 73 It may be that in the beginning there were plausible
reasons for some of these ordinances; and yet they are not adapted
to later times.  74 It is also evident that some were
adopted through erroneous conceptions. Therefore it would be
befitting the clemency of the Pontiffs to mitigate them now,
because such a modification does not shake the unity of the
Church. For many human traditions have been changed in process
of time,  75 as the Canons themselves show. But if it
be impossible to obtain a mitigation of such observances as
cannot be kept without sin, we are bound to follow the apostolic
rule, Acts 5:29, which commands us to obey God rather than
men.

76 Peter, 1 Pet. 5:3, forbids bishops to be lords, and to rule
over the churches.  77 It is not our design now to wrest
the government from the bishops, but this one thing is asked,
namely, that they allow the Gospel to be purely taught, and
that they relax some few observances which  78 cannot
be kept without sin. But if they make no concession, it is for
them to see how they shall give account to God for furnishing,
by their obstinacy, a cause for schism.

### Conclusion.

1 These are the chief articles which seem to be in controversy.
For although we might have spoken of more abuses, yet, to avoid
undue length, we have set forth the chief points, from which
the rest may be readily judged.  2 There have been great
complaints concerning indulgences, pilgrimages, and the abuse
of excommunications. The parishes have been vexed in many ways
by the dealers in indulgences. There were endless contentions
between the pastors and the monks concerning the parochial right,
confessions, burials, sermons on extraordinary occasions, and
 3 innumerable other things. Issues of this sort we have
passed over so that the chief points in this matter, having
been briefly set forth, might be the more readily understood.
 4 Nor has anything been here said or adduced to the
reproach of any one.  5 Only those things have been recounted
whereof we thought that it was necessary to speak, in order
that it might be understood that in doctrine and ceremonies
nothing has been received on our part against Scripture or the
Church Catholic. For it is manifest that we have taken most
diligent care that no new and ungodly doctrine should creep
into our churches.

6 The above articles we desire to present in accordance with the
edict of Your Imperial Majesty, in order to exhibit our Confession
and let men see a summary of the doctrine of our teachers.  7
If there is anything that any one might desire in this Confession,
we are ready, God willing, to present ampler information according
to the Scriptures.

9 John, Duke of Saxony, Elector

10 George, Margrave of Brandenburg.
