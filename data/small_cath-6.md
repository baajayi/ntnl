<blockquote><blockquote>  
            <ul><p><b>Q. What is the Sacrament of the Altar?</b></p> 
 
            <p><b>A.</b> It is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ under 
               bread and wine for us Christians to eat and to drink, 
               established by Christ Himself.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote> 
            <ul><p><b>Q. Where is that written?</b></p> 
 
            <p><b>A.</b> The holy apostles Matthew, Mark and Luke and St. Paul 
               write this:</p> 
 
            <p><i>Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the night on which He was 
                 betrayed, took bread, gave thanks, broke it, gave it to His 
                 disciples and said: "Take! Eat! This is My body, which is 
                 given for you. Do this to remember Me!" In the same way He 
                 also took the cup after supper, gave thanks, gave it to 
                 them, and said: "Take and drink from it, all of you! This 
                 cup is the New Testament in my blood, which is shed for you 
                 to forgive sins. This do, as often as you drink it, to 
                 remember Me!"</i></p></ul> 

</blockquote></blockquote> 
<p><b><center><a name="3">III.</a></center></b></p>
<blockquote><blockquote> 
            <ul><p><b>Q. What good does this eating and drinking do?</b></p> 
 
            <p><b>A.</b> These words tell us: "Given for you" and "Shed for you to 
               forgive sins." Namely, that the forgiveness of sins, life and 
               salvation are given to us through these words in the 
               sacrament. Because, where sins are forgiven, there is life and 
               salvation as well.</p></ul> 

</blockquote></blockquote> 
<p><b><center><a name="4">IV.</a></center></b></p>
<blockquote><blockquote> 
            <ul><p><b>Q. How can physical eating and drinking do such great things?</b></p> 
 
            <p><b>A.</b> Of course, eating and drinking do not do these things. These 
               words, written here, do them: "given for you" and "shed for 
               you to forgive sins." These words, along with physical eating 
               and drinking are the important part of the sacrament. Anyone 
               who believes these words has what they say and what they 
               record, namely, the forgiveness of sins.</p></ul> 

</blockquote></blockquote> 
<p><b><center><a name="5">V.</a></center></b></p>
<blockquote><blockquote> 
            <ul><p><b>Q. Who, then, receives such a sacrament in a worthy way?</b></p> 
 
            <p><b>A.</b> Of course, fasting and other physical preparations are 
               excellent disciplines for the body. But anyone who believes 
               these words, "Given for you," and "Shed for you to forgive 
               sins," is really worthy and well prepared.  But whoever 
               doubts or does not believe these words is not worthy and is 
               unprepared, because the words, "for you" demand a heart that 
               fully believes.</p></ul>
