<b>How a Father Should Teach His Household

<p><b><center>Morning Devotions</center></p></b> 
<blockquote><blockquote>
 
       <ul><p>As soon as you get out of bed in the morning, you should bless 
       yourself with the sign of the Holy Cross and say:</p> 
 
 
       <p><i>May the will of God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be 
       done! Amen.</i></p> 
 
 
       <p>Then, kneeling or standing, say the creed and pray the Lord's 
       Prayer. If you wish, you may then pray this little prayer as well:</p> 
 
       <p><i>My Heavenly Father, I thank You, through Jesus Christ, Your 
       beloved Son, that You kept me safe from all evil and danger last 
       night. Save me, I pray, today as well, from every evil and sin, so 
       that all I do and the way that I live will please you. I put 
       myself in your care, body and soul and all that I have. Let Your 
       holy Angels be with me, so that the evil enemy will not gain power 
       over me. Amen.</i></p> 
 
       <p>After that, with joy go about your work and perhaps sing a song 
       inspired by the Ten Commandments or your own thoughts.</p>

<p><b><center>The Evening Devotions</center></p></b> 
<blockquote><blockquote>

       <p>When you go to bed in the evening, you should bless yourself with 
       the sign of the Holy Cross and say:</p> 
 
       <p><i>May the will of God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be 
       done! Amen.</i></p> 
 
       <p>Then, kneeling or standing, say the creed and pray the Lord's 
       Prayer. If you wish, then you may pray this little prayer as well:</p> 
 
       <p><i>My Heavenly Father, I thank You, through Jesus Christ, Your 
       beloved Son, that You have protected me, by Your grace. Forgive, I 
       pray, all my sins and the evil I have done. Protect me, by Your 
       grace, tonight. I put myself in your care, body and soul and all 
       that I have. Let Your holy angels be with me, so that the evil 
       enemy will not gain power over me. Amen.</i></p> 
 
       <p>After this, go to sleep immediately with joy.</p> 
 
 
<p><b>How a Father Should Teach His Household 
to say Grace and Return Thanks at Meals:</b></p> 
 
       <ul><p>The children and servants should come to the table modestly and 
       with folded hands and say:</p> 
 
       <p><i>All eyes look to you, O Lord, and You give everyone food at the 
       right time. You open Your generous hands and satisfy the hunger of 
       all living things with what they desire.</i></p> 
 
       <p>Note:</p> 
 
       <p>"What they desire" means that all animals get so much to eat, that 
       they are happy and cheerful. Because, worry and greed interferes 
       with such desires.</p> 
 
       <p>After this, pray the Lord's Prayer and the following prayer:</p> 
 
       <p><i>Lord God, Heavenly Father, bless us and these gifts, which we 
       receive from Your generous hand, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. 
       Amen.</i></p></ul>
