                     A Letter From Luther to Melanchthon
               Letter no. 99, 1 August 1521, From the Wartburg

              from: _Dr. Martin Luther's Saemmtliche Schriften_
                        Dr, Johannes Georg Walch, Ed.
               (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, N.D.),

                                   Jesus.

    Of course, you can only know and absolve those sins which have been 
    confessed to you; sins which have not been confessed to you, you  
    neither need to know nor can you absolve them. That is reaching too 
    high, dear gentlemen."
    
    You cannot convince me that the same is true for the vows made by 
    priests and monks.  For I am very concerned about the fact that the 
    order of priesthood was instituted by God as a free one. Not so that 
    of the monks who chose their position voluntarily, even though I have 
    almost come to the conclusion that those who have entered into that 
    state at an age prior to their manhood, or are currently at that 
    stage, may secede with a clear conscience. I am hesitant, however, 
    with a judgment about those who have been in this state for a long 
    time and have grown old in it. 
    
    2. By the way, St. Paul very freely speaks about the priests (1.Tim: 
    4, ff), that devils have forbidden them to marry; and St. Paul's 
    voice is the voice of the divine majesty. Therefore, I do not doubt 
    that they must depend on him to such a degree that even though they 
    agreed to this interdiction of the devil at the time, now--having 
    realized with whom they made their contract--they can cheerfully 
    break this contract.
    
    3. This interdiction by the devil, which is clearly shown by God's 
    Word, urges and compels me to sanction the actions of the Bishop of 
    Kemberg. For God does not lie nor deceive when He says that this is 
    an interdiction from the devil.  If a contract has been made with the 
    devil it must not endure since it was made in godless error against 
    God and was damned and repudiated by God.  For He says very clearly 
    (1. Tim. 4:1 Vulg.) that those spirits are in error who are the 
    originators of the interdictions.  
    
    4. Why do you hesitate to join this divine judgment against the gates 
    of hell? That is not how it was with the oath of the children of 
    Israel which they gave to the Gibeons.  They had it in their laws 
    that they must offer peace or accept peace offered to them, and 
    accept into their midst proselytes and those who adhered to their 
    customs.  All this took place. Nothing happened there against the 
    Lord or by the advice of spirits. For even though in the beginning 
    they murmured, later on they approved.
    
    5. In addition, consider that the state of being unmarried is only a 
    human statute and can be readily lifted. Therefore any Christian can 
    do this.  I would make this statement even if the interdiction had 
    not come from a devil, but from a devout person.  However, because 
    there is no such statement by God concerning the monks, I am 
    therefore not certain that I should make the same pronouncement 
    concerning them. For I would not dare to presume, neither advice 
    another to do so.  Would God that we could do this, though, in order 
    to prevent someone from becoming a monk, or leaving his order during 
    the years of his virility.  For we are to avoid vexations if there is 
    no relevant scriptural passage available to us, even when dealing 
    with things which are permitted. 
    
    6. Good old Carlstadt is also citing St. Paul (1 Tim.5:9-11), to let 
    go of the younger widows and select 60-year-olds, wish to God this 
    could be demonstrated. Quite easily someone might say that the 
    Apostle referred to the future, while in reference to the past (V.12) 
    they are condemned because they have broken their first troth. 
    Therefore this expression has come to naught and cannot be a 
    dependable basis for the conscience. For that is what we are 
    searching for.  Moreover, this reasoning that it is better to be 
    married than to burn with vain desire (1 Cor.7:9), or to prevent the 
    sins of immorality (1 Cor.7:2), by entering into marriage while 
    committing the sin of the broken troth, that is nothing but common-
    sense.  We want the scripture and the witness of God's will.  Who 
    knows if the one who is very enthusiastic today will still be so 
    tomorrow?  
    
    7. I would not have allowed marriage for priests for the sole reason 
    of "burning" had not St. Paul called this interdiction devilish and 
    hypocritical, condemned by God. Even without the burning he urged 
    that this unmarried status be cast aside simply for the fear of God.  
    However, it is necessary to discuss these things more thoroughly. For 
    I too would love to come to the aid of the monks and nuns. I very 
    much pity these wretched human beings, these young men and girls who 
    suffer defilement and burning.
    
    8. Concerning the two elements of the Holy Supper I will not give an 
    example, but give testimony with Christ's words. Carlstadt does not 
    show that those who have received only one element have sinned, or 
    not sinned. I am concerned that Christ did not command either one of 
    the two, just as He does not command baptism if the tyrant or the 
    world withhold the water.  So also the violence of persecution 
    separates men and women, which God forbids to separate, neither do 
    they agree to be separated. Therefore, neither do godfearing hearts 
    agree that they should be robbed of one of the elements. However, 
    those who do agree and approve: who can deny that these are not 
    Christians but Papists who are sinning.
    
    9. There HE does not demand it, and here the tyrant oppresses, I 
    therefore cannot agree that those who receive only one element are 
    sinning.  For who can exert power to take something when the tyrant 
    is not willing?  Therefore it is only common-sense which observes 
    here that Christ's institution is not adhered to.  Scripture makes no 
    definition by which we could declare this act a sin.  It is Christ's 
    institution, given in freedom, which cannot be incarcerated as a 
    whole or in part.
    
    10. It happened to Donatus, the martyr, where several people could 
    not participate because the cup broke or the wine was spilled. What 
    if this happens and there is no other wine available? There are other 
    similar situations. In short, because Scripture does not speak of sin 
    here, I therefore say there is no sin involved.  
    
    11. I am quite pleased, though, that you are re-establishing Christ's 
    method. For it was just that which I planned to take up with you 
    first of all upon my return to you.  For now we recognize this 
    tyranny and can oppose it, in order not to be forced to receive only 
    one of the elements.       
    
    12. From here on I will no longer conduct private mass. Rather we 
    should pray God to give us more of His Spirit.  For I am expecting 
    that the Lord will soon ravish Germany--which she deserves because of 
    her unbelief, godlessness and hate of the Gospel.  However, we shall 
    be blamed for this chastisement, as we are made out to be heretics 
    who have provoked God to this action. We shall be scorned by the 
    people and disdained by the nation.  Those, however, will make 
    excuses for their sins, through which He will manifest that the hard-
    hearted do not become godly neither by mercy nor wrath. Let it 
    happen, let the will of the Lord be done. Amen!
    
    13. If you are a preacher of mercy, do not preach an imaginary but 
    the true mercy.  If the mercy is true, you must therefore bear the 
    true, not an imaginary sin.  God does not save those who are only 
    imaginary sinners.  Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong, but let 
    your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the 
    victor over sin, death, and the world.  We will commit sins while we 
    are here, for this life is not a place where justice resides.  We, 
    however, says Peter (2. Peter 3:13) are looking forward to a new 
    heaven and a new earth where justice will reign.  It suffices that 
    through God's glory we have recognized the Lamb who takes away the 
    sin of the world. No sin can separate us from Him, even if we were to 
    kill or commit adultery thousands of times each day.  Do you think 
    such an exalted Lamb paid merely a small price with a meager 
    sacrifice for our sins?  Pray hard for you are quite a sinner.
