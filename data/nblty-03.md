<b><center>I<br> 
THE THREE WALLS OF THE ROMANISTS</center></b>
 
<blockquote><blockquote>
 
 
<p>The Romanists[1], with great adroitness, have built three walls about them, 
 behind which they have hitherto defended themselves in such wise that no one  
 has been able to reform them; and this has been the cause of terrible  
 corruption throughout all Christendom. </p> 
  
<p>First, when pressed by The temporal power, they have made decrees and said  
 that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over them, but, on the other  
 hand, that the spiritual is above the temporal power. Second, when the  
 attempt is made to reprove them out of the Scriptures, they raise the  
 objection that the interpretation of the Scriptures belongs to no one except  
 the pope. Third, if threatened with a council, they answer with the fable  
 that no one can call a council but the pope. </p> 
  
<p>In this wise they have slyly stolen from us our three rods[2], that they may  
 go unpunished, and have ensconced themselves within the safe stronghold of  
 these three walls, that they may practice all the knavery and wickedness which  
 we now see. Even when they have been compelled to hold a council they have  
 weakened its power in advance by previously binding the princes with an oath 
 to let them remain as they are. Moreover, they have given the pope full 
 authority over all the decisions of the council, so that it is all one whether  
 there are many councils or no councils, -- except that they deceive us with  
 puppet-shows and sham-battles. So terribly do they fear for their skin in a  
 really free council! And they have intimidated kings and princes by making  
 them believe it would be an offense against God not to obey them in all these  
 knavish, crafty deceptions.[3] </p> 
  
<p>Josh. 6:20 Now God help us, and give us one of the trumpets with which the  
 walls of Jericho were overthrown, that we may blow down these walls of straw  
 and paper, and may set free the Christian rods for the punishment of sin,  
 bringing to light the craft and deceit of the devil, to the end that through  
 punishment we may reform ourselves, and once more attain God's favor. </p> 
  
<p>Against the first wall we will direct our first attack. </p> 
  
<p>It is pure invention that pope, bishops, priests and monks are to be called  
 the "spiritual estate"; princes, lords, artisans, and farmers the "temporal  
 estate." That is indeed a fine bit of lying and hypocrisy. Yet no one should  
 be frightened by it; and for this reason -- viz., that all Christians are truly  
 of the "spiritual estate," and there is among them no difference at all but  
 that of office, as Paul says in I Corinthians 12:12, We are all one body, yet  
 every member has its own work, where by it serves every other, all because we  
 have one baptism, one Gospel, one faith, and are all alike Christians; for  
 baptism, Gospel and faith alone make us "spiritual" and a Christian people. </p> 
  
<p>But that a pope or a bishop anoints, confers tonsures; ordains, consecrates,  
 or prescribes dress unlike that of the laity, this may make hypocrites and  
 graven images,[4] but it never makes a Christian or "spiritual" man. Through  
 baptism all of us are consecrated to the priesthood, as St. Peter says in  
 I Peter 2:9, "Ye are a royal priesthood, a priestly kingdom," and the book of  
 Revelation says, Rev. 5:10 "Thou hast made us by Thy blood to be priests and  
 kings." For if we had no higher consecration than pope or bishop gives, the  
 consecration by pope or bishop would never make a priest, nor might anyone  
 either say mass or preach a sermon or give absolution. Therefore when the  
 bishop consecrates it is the same thing as if he, in the place and stead of  
 the whole congregation, all of whom have like power, were to take one out of  
 their number and charge him to use this power for the others; just as though  
 ten brothers, all king's sons and equal heirs, were to choose one of  
 themselves to rule the inheritance for them all, -- they would all be kings and  
 equal in power, though one of them would be charged with the duty of ruling. </p> 
  
<p>To make it still clearer. If a little group of pious Christian laymen were  
 taken captive and set down in a wilderness , and had among them no priest  
 consecrated by a bishop, and if there in the wilderness they were to agree in  
 choosing one of themselves, married or unmarried, and were to charge him with  
 the office of baptizing, saying mass, absolving and preaching, such a man  
 would be as truly a priest as though all bishops and popes had consecrated  
 him. That is why in cases of necessity any one can baptize and give  
 absolution,[5] which would be impossible unless we were all priests. This  
 great grace and power of baptism and of the Christian Estate they have  
 well-nigh destroyed and caused us to forget through The canon law.[6] It was  
 in the manner aforesaid that Christians in olden days chose from their number  
 bishops and priests, who were afterwards confirmed by other bishops, without  
 all the show which now obtains. It was Thus that Sts. Augustine,[7] Ambrose[8] 
and Cyprian[9] became bishops. </p> 
  
<p>Since, then, the temporal authorities are baptized with the same baptism and  
 have the same faith and Gospel as we, we must grant that they are priests and  
 bishops, and count their office one which has a proper and a useful place in  
 the Christian community. For whoever comes out the water of baptism[10] can  
 boast that he is already consecrated priest, bishop and pope, though it is not  
 seemly that every one should exercise the office. Nay, just because we are all  
 in like manner priests, no one must put himself forward and undertake, without  
 our consent and election, to do what is in the power of all of us. For what is  
 common to all, no one dare take upon himself without the will and the command  
 of the community; and should it happen that one chosen for such an office were  
 deposed for malfeasance, he would then be just what he was before he held  
 office. Therefore a priest in Christendom is nothing else than an  
office-holder.  
 While he is in office, he has precedence; when deposed, he is a peasant or a  
 townsman like the rest. Beyond all doubt, then, a priest is no longer a priest  
 when he is deposed. But now they have invented characters indelebilis,[11] and  
 prate that a deposed priest is nevertheless something different from a mere  
 layman. They even dream that a priest can never become a layman, or be  
 anything else than a priest. All this is mere talk and man-made law. </p> 
  
<p>From all this it follows that there is really no difference between laymen and  
 priests, princes and bishops, "spirituals" and "temporals," as they call them,  
 except that of office and work, but not of "estate"; for they are all of the  
 same estate,[12] -- true priests, bishops and popes, -- though they are not all  
 engaged in the same work, just as all priests and monks have not the same  
 work. This is the teaching of St. Paul in Romans 12:4 and I Corinthians 12:12,  
 and of St. Peter in I Peter 2:9, as I have said above, viz., that we are all  
 one body of Christ, the Head, all members one of another. Christ has not two  
 different bodies, one "temporal ," the other "spiritual." He is one Head, and  
 He has One body. </p> 
  
<p>Therefore, just as Those who are now called "spiritual" -- priests, bishops or  
 popes -- are neither different from other Christians nor superior to them,  
 except that they are charged with the administration of the Word of God and  
 the sacraments, which is their work and office, so it is with the temporal  
 authorities, -- they bear sword and rod with which to punish the evil and to  
 protect die good. A cobbler, a smith, a farmer, each has the work and office  
 of his trade, and yet they are all alike consecrated priests and bishops, and  
 every one by means of his own work or office must benefit and serve every  
 other, that in this way many kinds of work may be done for the bodily and  
 spiritual welfare of the community, even as all the members of the body serve  
 one another. </p> 
  
<p>See, now, how Christian is the decree which says that the temporal power is  
 not above the "spiritual estate" and may not punish it.[13] That is as much  
 as to say that the hand shall lend no aid when the eye is suffering. Is it not  
 unnatural, not to say unchristian, that one member should not help another  
 and prevent its destruction? Verily, the more honorable the member, the more  
 should the others help. I say then, since the temporal power is ordained of  
 God to punish evil-doers and to protect them that do well, it should therefore  
 be left free to perform it office without hindrance through the whole body of  
 Christendom without respect of persons, whether it affect pope, bishops, 
priests, monks, nuns or anybody else. For if the mere fact that the temporal  
 power has a smaller place among The Christian offices than has the office of  
 preachers or confessors, or of the clergy, then the tailors, cobblers, masons,  
 carpenters, pot-boys, tapsters, farmers, and all the secular tradesmen, should  
 also be prevented from providing pope, bishops, priests and monks with shoes,  
 clothing, houses, meat and drink, and from paying them tribute. But if these  
 laymen are allowed to do their work unhindered, what do the Roman scribes  
 mean by their laws, with which they withdraw themselves from the  
 jurisdiction of the temporal Christian power, only so that the may be free  
 to do evil and to fulfill what St. Peter has said: 2. Peter 2:1 "There shall be  
 false teachers among you, and through covetousness shall they with feigned  
 words make merchandise of you." </p> 
  
<p>On this account the Christian temporal power should exercise its office  
 without let or hindrance, regardless whether it be pope, bishop or priest whom  
 it affects; whoever is guilty, let him suffer. All that the canon law has said  
 to the contrary is sheer invention of Roman presumption. For Thus saith St.  
 Paul to all Christians: Roman 13:1, 4 "Let every soul (I take that to mean  
 the pope's soul also) be subject unto the higher powers; for they bear not the  
 sword in vain, but are the ministers of God for the punishment of evildoers,  
 and for the praise of them that do well." St. Peter also says: 1 Peter  
 2:13, 15 "Submit yourselves unto every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake,  
 for so is the will of God" He has also prophesied that such men shall come as  
 will despise the temporal authorities; and this has come to pass through the  
 canon law. </p> 
  
<p>So then, I think this first paper-wall is overthrown, since the temporal power  
 has become a member of the body of Christendom, and is of the "spiritual  
 estate," though its work is of a temporal nature. Therefore its work should  
 extend freely and without hindrance to all the members of the whole body; it  
 should punish and use force whenever guilt deserves or necessity demands,  
 without regard to pope, bishops and priests,-let them hail threats and bans as  
 much as they will. </p> 
  
<p>Again, it is intolerable that in the canon law so much importance is attached  
 to the freedom, life and property of the clergy, as though the laity were not  
 also as spiritual as good Christians as they, or did not belong to the Church.  
 Why are your life and limb, your property and honor so free, and mine not? We  
 are all alike Christians, and have baptism, faith, Spirit and all things  
 alike. If a priest is killed, the land is laid under interdict,[15] -- why  
 not when a peasant is killed? Whence comes this great distinction between  
 those who are equally Christians? Only from human laws and inventions! </p> 
  
<p>Moreover, it can be no good spirit who has invented such exceptions and  
 granted to sin such license and impunity. For if we are bound to strive  
 against the works and words of the evil spirit, and to drive him out in  
 whatever way we can, as Christ commands and His Apostles, ought we, then  
 to suffer it in silence when the pope or his satellites are bent on devilish  
 words and works? Ought we for the sake of men to allow the suppression of  
 divine commandments and truths which we have sworn in baptism to support  
 with life and limb? Of a truth we should then have to answer all the souls that  
 would thereby be abandoned and it astray. </p> 
  
<p>It must therefore have been the very prince of devils who said what is written 
 in the canon law: "If the pope were so scandalously bad as to lead  
 souls in crowds to the devil, yet he could not be deposed."[16] On this  
 accursed and devilish foundation they build at Rome, and think that we should  
 let all the world go to the devil, rather than resist their knavery. If the  
 fact that one man is set over others were sufficient reason why he should  
 escape punishment, then no Christian could punish another, since Christ  
 commands that every man shall esteem himself the lowliest and the least. </p> 
   
<p>Where sin is, there is no escape from punishment; as St. Gregory[17] also   
 writes that we are indeed all equal, but guilt puts us in subjection one to   
 another. Now we see how they whom God and the Apostles have made subject to   
 the temporal sword deal with Christendom, depriving it of its liberty by their   
 own wickedness, without warrant of Scripture. It is to be feared that this is   
 a game of Antichrist[18] or a sign that he is close at hand. </p>  
   
<p>The second wall[19] is still more flimsy and worthless. They wish to be the   
 only Masters of The Holy Scriptures,[20] even though in all their lives they   
 learn nothing from them. They assume for themselves sole authority, and with   
 insolent juggling of words they would persuade us that the pope, whether he be   
 a bad man or a good man, cannot err in matters of faith,[21] and yet they   
 cannot prove a single letter of it. Hence it comes that so many heretical and   
 unchristian, nay, even unnatural ordinances have a place in the canon law, of   
 which, however, there is no present need to speak. For since they think that   
 the Holy Spirit never leaves them, be they never so unlearned and wicked, they   
 make bold to decree whatever they will. And if it were true, where would be   
 the need or use of Holy Scriptures? Let us burn them, and be satisfied with   
 the unlearned lords at Rome, who are possessed of the Holy Spirit, -- although   
 He can possess only pious hearts! Unless I had read it myself,[22] I could   
 not have believed that the devil would make such clumsy pretensions at Rome,   
 and find a following. </p>  
   
<p>But not to fight them with mere words, we will quote the Scriptures. St. Paul   
 says in I Corinthians 14:30: "If to anyone something better is revealed,   
 though he be sitting and listening to another in God's Word, then the first,   
 who is speaking, shall hold his peace and give place." What would be the use   
 of this commandment, if we were only to believe him who does the talking or   
 who has the highest seat? Christ also says in John 6:45, that all Christians   
 shall be taught of God. Thus it may well happen that the pope and his   
 followers are wicked men, and no true Christians, not taught of God, not   
 having true understanding. On the other hand, an ordinary man may have true   
 understanding; why then should we not follow him? Has not the pope erred many   
 times? Who would help Christendom when the pope errs, if we were not to   
 believe another, who had the Scriptures on his side, more than the pope? </p>  
   
<p>Therefore it is a wickedly invented fable, and they cannot produce a letter in   
 defense of it, that the interpretation of Scripture or the confirmation of its   
 interpretation belongs to the pope alone. They have themselves usurped this   
 power; and although they allege that this power was given to Peter when the   
 keys were given to him, it is plain enough that the keys were not given to   
 Peter alone, but to the whole community.[23] Moreover, the keys were not   
 ordained for doctrine or government, but only for the binding and loosing of   
 they arrogate to themselves is mere invention But Christ's word to Peter, Luke   
 22:32 "I have prayed for thee that thy faith fall not," cannot be applied to   
 the pope, since the majority of the popes have been without faith, as they 
  must themselves confess. Besides, it is not only for Peter that Christ   
 prayed, but also for all Apostles and Christians, as he says in John 17:9, 20:   
 "Father, I pray for those whom Thou hast given Me, and not for these only, but   
 for all who believe on Me through their word." Is not this clear enough? </p>  
   
<p>Only think of it yourself! They must confess that there are pious Christians   
 among us, who have the true faith, Spirit, understanding, word and mind of   
 Christ. Why, then, should we reject their word and understanding and follow   
 the pope, who has neither faith nor Spirit? That would be to deny the whole   
 faith and the Christian Church. Moreover, it is not the pope alone who is   
 always in the right, if the article of The Creed is correct: "I believe one   
 holy Christian Church"; otherwise the prayer must run: "I believe in the pope   
 at Rome," and so reduce the Christian Church to one man, -- which would be   
 nothing else than a devilish and hellish error. </p>  
   
<p>Besides, if we are all priests, as was said above, [24] and all have one   
 faith, one Gospel, one sacrament, why should we not also have the power to   
 test and judge what is correct or incorrect in matters of faith? What becomes   
 of the words of Paul in I Corinthians 2:15: "He that is spiritual judgeth all   
 things, yet he himself is judged of no man," II Corinthians 4:13: "We have   
 all the same Spirit of faith"? Why, then, should not we perceive what squares   
 with faith and what does not, as well as does an unbelieving pope? </p>  
   
<p>All these and many other texts should make us bold and free, and we should   
 not allow the Spirit of liberty, as Paul calls Him, to be frightened off   
 by the fabrications of the popes, but we ought to go boldly forward to test   
 all that they do or leave undone, according to our interpretation of the   
 Scriptures, which rests on faith, and compel them to follow not their own   
 interpretation, but the one that is better. In the olden days Abraham had to   
 listen to Sarah, although she was in more complete subjection to him than we   
 are to anyone on earth. Balaam's ass, also, was wiser than the prophet   
 himself. If God then spoke an ass against a prophet, why should He not be able   
 even now to speak by a righteous man against the pope? In like manner St. Paul   
 rebukes St. Peter as a man in error. Therefore it behooves every Christian to   
 espouse the cause of the faith, to understand and defend it, and to rebuke   
 errors. </p>  
   
<p>The third wall  falls of itself when the first two are down. For when the   
 pope acts contrary to the Scriptures, it is our duty to stand by the   
 Scriptures, to reprove him, and to constrain him, according to the word of   
 Christ in Matthew 18:15: "If thy brother sin against thee, go and tell it him   
 between thee and him alone; if he hear thee not, then take with thee one or   
 two more; if he hear them not, tell it to the Church; if he hear not the   
 Church, consider him a heathen." Here every member is commanded to care for   
 every other. How much rather should we do this when the member that does evil   
 is a ruling member, and by his evil-doing is the cause of much harm and   
 offense to the rest! But if I am to accuse him before the Church, I must   
 bring the Church together. </p>  
   
<p>They have no basis in Scripture for their contention that it belongs to the   
 pope alone to call a council or confirm its actions;[25] for this is based   
 merely upon their own laws, which are valid only in so far as they are not   
 injurious to Christendom or contrary to the laws of God. When the pope   
 deserves punishment, such laws go out of force, since it is injurious to 
 Christendom not to punish him by means of a council. </p>  
   
<p>Thus we read in Acts 15:6 that it was not St. Peter who called the Apostolic   
 Council, but the Apostles and elders. If, then, that right had belonged to   
 St. Peter alone, the council would not have been a Christian council, but an   
 heretical conciliabulum.[26] Even the Council of Nicaea -- the most famous   
 of all-was neither called nor confirmed by the Bishop of Rome, but by the   
 Emperor Constantine,[27] and many other emperors after him did the like,   
 yet these councils were the most Christian of all.[28] But if the pope alone   
 had the right to call councils, then all then all councils must have been   
 heretical. Moreover, if I consider the councils which the pope has created, I   
 find that they have done nothing of special importance. </p>  
   
<p>Therefore, when necessity demands, and the pope is an offense to Christendom,   
 the first man who is able should, a faithful member of the whole body, do what   
 he can to bring about a truly free council.[29] No one can do this so well as   
 the temporal authorities, especially since now they also are fellow-Christians,   
 fellow-priests, "fellow-spirituals,"[30] fellow-lords over all things, and   
 whenever it is needful or profitable, they should give free course to office   
 and work in which God has put them above every man. Would it not be an   
 unnatural thing, if a fire broke out in a city, and everybody were to stand by   
 and it burn on and on and consume everything that could burn, for the sole   
reason   
 that nobody had the authority of the burgomaster, or because, perhaps, the   
 fire broke in the burgomaster's house? In such case is it not the duty of every   
 citizen to arouse and call the rest? How much more should this be done in   
 the spiritual city of Christ, if a fire of offense breaks out, whether in the   
 papal government, or anywhere else? In the same way, if the enemy attacks   
 a city, he who first rouses the others deserves honor and thanks; why then   
 should he not deserve honor who makes known the presence of the enemy   
 from hell, awakens the Christians, and calls them together? </p>  
   
<p>But all their boasts of an authority which dare not opposed amount to nothing   
 after all. No one in Christendom has authority to do injury, or to forbid the   
 resisting of injury. There is no authority in the Church save edification.   
 Therefore, if the pope were to use his authority to prevent the calling of a   
 free council, and thus became a hindrance to the edification of the Church, we   
 should have regard neither for him nor for his authority; and if he were to   
 hurl his bans and thunderbolts, we should despise his conduct as that of a   
 madman, and relying on God, hurl back the ban on him, and coerce him as best   
 we could. For this presumptuous authority of his is nothing; he has no such   
 authority, and he is quickly overthrown by a text of Scripture; for Paul says   
 to the Corinthians, II Corinthians 10:8 "God has given us authority not for   
 the destruction, but for the edification of Christendom." Who is ready to   
 overleap this text? It is only the power of the devil and of Antichrist which   
 resists the things that serve for the edification of Christendom; it is,   
 therefore, in no wise to be obeyed, but is to be opposed with life and goods   
 and all our strength. </p>  
   
<p>Even though a miracle were to be done in the pope's behalf against the   
 temporal powers, or though someone were to be stricken with a plague -- which   
 they boast has sometimes happened -- it should be considered only the work of the   
 devil, because of the weakness of our faith in God. Christ Himself prophesied   
 in Matthew 24:24: "There shall come in My Name false Christs and false 
 prophets, and do signs and wonders, so as to deceive even the elect," and Paul   
 says in II Thessalonians 2:9, that Antichrist shall, through the power of   
 Satan, be mighty in lying wonders. </p>  
   
<p>Let us, therefore, hold fast to this: No Christian authority can do anything   
 against Christ; as St. Paul says, II Corinthians 13:8: "We can do nothing   
 against Christ, but for Christ." Whatever does aught against Christ is the   
 power of Antichrist and of the devil, even though it were to rain and hail   
 wonders and plagues. Wonders and plagues prove nothing, especially in these   
 last evil times, for which all the Scriptures prophesy false wonders. Therefore   
 we must cling with firm faith to the words of God, and then the devil will   
cease   
 from wonders. </p>  
   
<p>Thus I hope that the false, lying terror with which the Romans have this long   
 time made our conscience timid and stupid, has been allayed. They, like all of   
 us, are subject to the temporal sword; they have no power to interpret the   
 Scriptures by mere authority, without learning; they have no authority to   
 prevent a council or, in sheer wantonness, to pledge it, bind it, or take   
 away its liberty; but if they do this, they are in truth the communion of   
 Antichrist and of the devil, and have nothing at all of Christ except the   
 name.

<p>[1] The term "Romanist" is applied by Luther to the champions of the extreme   
 form of papal supremacy, Cf. Vol. I, p. 343 f. </p>  
   
<p>[2] i.e., The three rods for the punishment of an evil pope. Vol. II, -- 5. </p>  
   
<p>[3] <b>Spuknisse</b>, literally "ghosts." The gist of the sentence is, "the   
Romanists   
 have frightened the world with ghost-stories." </p>  
   
<p>[4] <b>Oelgotze</b> - "an image anointed with holy oil to make it sacred"; in modern   
 German, "a blockhead." </p>  
   
<p>[5] Lay-baptism in view of imminent death is a practice as old as the   
 Christian Church. The right of the laity to administer baptism in such cases   
 was expressly recognized by the Council of Elvira, in the year 306, and the   
 decree of that Council became a part of the law of the Church. The right of   
 the laity to give absolution in such cases rests on the principle that in the   
 absence of the appointed official of the Church any Christian can do for any   
 other Christian the things that are absolutely necessary for salvation, for   
 "necessity knows no law." Cf. Vol. I, p. 30, note 2. </p>  
   
<p>[6] The canon law, called by Luther throughout this treatise and elsewhere,   
 the "spiritual law," is a general name for the decrees of councils ("cannons"   
 in the strict sense) and decisions of the popes ("decretals," "constitutions,"   
 etc.), promulgated by authority of the popes, and collected in the so-called   
 <b>Corpus juriscanonici</b>. It comprised the whole body of Church law, and embodied   
 in legal forms the medieval theory of papal absolutism, which accounts for the   
 bitterness with which Luther speaks of it, especially in this treatise. The 
 </b>Corpus</b> includes the following collections of cannons and decretals: The   
 </b>Decretum of Gratian</b> (1142), the </b>Liber Extra</b> (1234), the </b>Liber Sextus</b>   
 (1298), the </b>Constitutiones Clementinae</b> (1318 or 1317), and the two books   
 of Extravagantes,  --  the <b>Extravagantes of John XXIV</b>, and the <b>Extravagantes

<p>[7] Augustine, the master-theologian of the Ancient Church, bishop of Hippo in   
 Africa from 395-430. </p>  
   
<p>[8] Ambrose, bishop of Milan from 374-397, had not yet been baptized at the   
 time of his election to the episcopate, which was forced upon him by the   
 unanimous voice of the people of the city. </p>  
   
<p>[9] Cyprian, bishop of Carthage, 247-258, is said to have consented to accept   
 the office only when the congregation surrounded his house and besought him to   
 yield to their entreaties. </p>  
   
<p>[10] <b>Was ausz der Tauff krochen ist</b>. </p>  
   
<p>[11] The character indelebilis, or "indelible mark," received authoritative   
 statement in the bull </b>Exultate Deo</b> (1439). Eugenius IV, summing up the   
 <b>Decrees of the Council of Florence</b>, says: "Among these sacraments there are   
 three -- baptism, confirmation, and orders -- which indelibly impress upon the   
 soul a character, i.e., a certain spiritual mark which distinguishes them from   
 the rest." (MIRBT, Quellen, 2d ed., No. 150). The Council of Trent in its   
 XXIII. Session, July 15, 1563. (MIRBT, No. 312), defined the correct Roman   
 teaching as follows: "Since in the sacrament of orders, as in baptism and   
 confirmation, a character is impressed which cannot be destroyed or taken   
 away, the Holy Synod justly condemns the opinion of those who assert that the   
 priests of the New Testament have only temporary power, and that those once   
 rightly ordained can again be made laymen, if they do not exercise the   
 ministry of the Word of God." </p>  
   
<p>[12] i.e., They are all Christians, among whom there can be no essential   
 difference. </p>  
   
<p>[13] The sharp distinction which the Roman Church drew between clergy and   
 laity found practical application in the contention that the clergy should be   
 exempt from the jurisdiction of the civil courts, This is the so-called   
 <b>privilegium fori</b>, "benefit of clergy." It was further claimed that the   
 government of the clergy and the administration of Church property must be   
 entirely in the hands of the Church authorities, and that no lay rulers might   
 either make or enforce laws which in any way affected the Church. See <b>LEA,   
 Studies in Church History</b>, 169-219 and <b>Prot. Realencyk.</b>, Vi, 594. </p>  
   
<p>[14] It was the contention of the Church authorities that priests charged with   
 infraction of the laws of the state should first be tried in the ecclesiastical   
 courts. If found guilty, they were degraded from the priesthood and handed   
 over to the state authorities for punishment. Formula for degradation in the   
 canon law, c. 2 in VI, de poen. (V, 9). See <b>Prot. Realencyk.</b>, VI, 589. </p>  
   
<p>[15] The interdict is the prohibition of the administration of the sacraments   
 and of the other rites of the Church within the territory upon which the 
 interdict is laid (<b>Realencyk.</b>, IX, 208 f.). Its use was not uncommon in the   
 Middle Ages, and during the time that the power of the popes was at its height   
 it proved an effective means of bringing refractory rulers to terms. A famous   
 instance is the interdict laid upon the Kingdom of England by Innocent III in   
 1208. Interdicts of more limited local extent were quite frequent. The use   
 of the interdict as punishment for trifling infractions of church law was a   
 subject of complaint at the diets of Worms (1521) and Nurnberg (1524). See A.   
 WREDE, <b>Deutsche Reichstagsaktenn unter Kaiser Karl V.</b>, II, pp. 685 f, III,   
 665. </p>  
   
<p>[16] The statement of which Luther here complains is found in the <b>Decretum of   
 Gratian</b>, Dist. XL, c. 6, Si papa. In his Epitome (see Introduction, p. 58),   
 Prierias had quoted this canon against Luther, as follows: "A Pontifex   
 indubitatus (i.e., a pope who is not accused of heresy or schism) cannot   
 lawfully be deposed or judged either by a council or by the whole world, even   
 if he is so scandalous as to lead people with him by crowds into the   
 possession of hell." Luther's comment is: "Be astonished, O heaven; shudder,   
 O earth! Behold, O Christians, what Rome is!" (Weimar Ed., VI, 336). </p>  
   
<p>[17] Gregory the Great, pope 590-604. The passage is found in <b>MIGEN</b>, LXXVI,   
 203; LXXVII, 34. </p>  
   
<p>[18] Antichrist, the incarnation of all that is hostile to Christ and His   
 Kingdom. His appearance is prophesied in 2 Thess. 2:3-10 (the "man of sin,   
 sitting in the temple of God"); 1 John 2:18, 22:4:3, and Rev. 13. In the   
 early Church the Fathers sometimes thought the prophecies fulfilled in the   
 person of some especially pestilent heretic. Wyclif applied the term to the   
 pope, -- "the pope would seem to be not the vicar of Christ, but the vicar of   
 Antichrist" (see LOOFS, <b>Dogmengeschichte</b>, 4th ed., p. 649). </p>  
   
<p>[19] See above, p. 65. </p>  
   
<p>[20] According to academic usage, the holder of a Master's degree was   
 authorized to expound the subject named in the degree. </p>  
   
<p>[21] The doctrine of papal infallibility was never officially sanctioned in   
 the Middle Ages, but the claim of infallibility was repeatedly made by the   
 champions of the more extreme view of papal power, e.g., Augustinus Triumphus   
 (died 1328) in his <b>Summa de potestate Papae</b>. In his attack upon the XCV   
 Theses (<b>Dialogus de potestate Papae</b>, Dec., 1517) Prierias had asserted, "The   
 supreme pontiff (i.e., the pope) cannot err when giving a decision as pontiff,   
 i.e., speaking officially (<b>ex officio</b>), and doing what in him lies to learn   
 the truth"; and again, "Whoever does not rest upon the teaching of the Roman   
 Church and the supreme pontiff as an infallible rule of faith, from which even   
 Holy Scripture draws its vigor and authority, is a heretic" (Erl. Ed., op.   
 Var./ arg., I, 348). In the Epitome he had said: "Even though the pope as an   
 individual (<b>singularis persona</b>) can do wrong and hold a wrong faith,   
 nevertheless as pope he cannot give a wrong decision" (Weimar Ed., VI, 337). </p>  
   
<p>[22] Most recently in Prierias's Epitome. See preceding note. </p>  
   
<p>[23] Luther had discussed the whole subject of the power of the keys in the   
 Latin treatise, <b>Resolutio super propositione xiii. De potestate papae, of   
1519</b> 
(Weimar Ed., II, pp. 185 ff., and in the German treatise </b>The Papacy at Rome</b>   
 (Vol. I, pp. 337-394). </p>  
   
<p>[24] Pp. 66 ff. </p>  
   
<p>[25] Another contention of Prierias. In 1518 (Nov. 28th) Luther had appealed   
 his cause from the decision of the pope, which he foresaw would be adverse, to   
 the decision of a council to be held at some future time. In the <b>Epitome   
 Prierias</b> discusses this appeal, asserting, among other things, that "when   
 there is one undisputed pontiff, it belongs to him alone to call a council.",   
 and that "the decrees of councils neither bind nor hold (<b>nullum ligant vel   
 astringunt</b>) unless they are confirmed by authority of the Roman pontiff"   
 (Weimar Ed., Vi, 335). </p>  
   
<p>[26] i.e., A mere gathering of people. </p>  
   
<p>[27] The council of Nicaea, the first of the great councils of the Church,   
 assembled in 325 for the settlement of the Arian controversy. Luther's   
 statement that it was called by the Emperor Constantine, and that its   
 decisions did not derive their validity from any papal confirmation, is   
 historically correct. On Luther's statements about this council, see SCHAFER,   
 <b>Luther als Kirchenhistoriker</b>, pp. 291 ff.; KOHLER, <b>Luther und die Kg.</b>,   
 pp. 148 ff. </p>  
   
<p>[28] Luther is here referring to the earlier so-called "ecumenical" councils. </p>  
   
<p>[29] i.e., A council which will not be subject to the pope. Cf. Erl. Ed.,   
xxvi, III </p>  
   
<p>[30] i.e., They belong to the "spiritual estate"; see above, p.69.</p>
