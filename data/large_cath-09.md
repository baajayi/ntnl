<br><a name="cconclude">Conclusion of the Ten Commandments.</a> 
<br>__________</center></b> 
 
<blockquote><blockquote> 
 
<p>     Thus we have the Ten Commandments, a compend of divine 
        doctrine, as to what we are to do in order that our whole 
        life may be pleasing to God, and the true fountain and 
        channel from and in which everything must arise and flow 
        that is to be a good work, so that outside of the Ten 
        Commandments no work or thing can be good or pleasing to 
        God, however great or precious it be in the eyes of the 
        world. Let us see now what our great saints can boast of 
        their spiritual orders and their great and grievous works 
        which they have invented and set up, while they let these 
        pass, as though they were far too insignificant, or had 
        long ago been perfectly fulfilled.</p> 
 
<p>     I am of opinion indeed, that here one will find his hands 
        full, [and will have enough] to do to observe these, 
        namely, meekness, patience, and love towards enemies, 
        chastity, kindness, etc., and what such virtues imply. 
        But such works are not of value and make no display in 
        the eyes of the world; for they are not peculiar and 
        conceited works and restricted to particular times, 
        places, rites, and customs, but are common, every-day 
        domestic works which one neighbor can practise toward 
        another; therefore they are not of high esteem.</p> 
 
<p>     But the other works cause people to open their eyes and 
        ears wide, and men aid to this effect by the great 
        display, expense, and magnificent buildings with which 
        they adorn them, so that everything shines and glitters. 
        There they waft incense, they sing and ring bells, they 
        light tapers and candles, so that nothing else can be 
        seen or heard. For when a priest stands there in a 
        surplice embroidered with gilt, or a layman continues all 
        day upon his knees in church, that is regarded as a most 
        precious work which no one can sufficiently praise. But 
        when a poor girl tends a little child and faithfully does 
        what she is told that is considered nothing; for else 
        what should monks and nuns seek in their cloisters?</p> 
 
<p>     But see, is not that a cursed presumption of those 
        desperate saints who dare to invent a higher and better 
        life and estate than the Ten Commandments teach, 
        pretending (as we have said) that this is an ordinary 
        life for the common man, but that theirs is for saints 
        and perfect ones? And the miserable blind people do not 
        see that no man can get so far as to keep one of the Ten 
        Commandments as it should be kept, but both the Apostles' 
        Creed and the Lord's Prayer must come to our aid (as we 
        shall hear), by which that [power and strength to keep 
        the commandments] is sought and prayed for and received 
        continually. Therefore all their boasting amounts to as 
        much as if I boasted and said: To be sure, I have not a 
        penny to make payment with, but I confidently undertake 
        to pay ten florins.</p> 
 
<p>     All this I say and urge in order that men might become 
        rid of the sad misuse which has taken such deep root and 
        still cleaves to everybody, and in all estates upon earth 
        become used to looking hither only, and to being 
        concerned about these matters. For it will be a long time 
        before they will produce a doctrine or estates equal to 
        the Ten Commandments, because they are so high that no 
        one can attain to them by human power; and whoever does 
        attain to them is a heavenly, angelic man far above all 
        holiness of the world. Only occupy yourself with them, 
        and try your best, apply all power and ability and you 
        will find so much to do that you will neither seek nor 
        esteem any other work or holiness.</p> 
 
<p>     Let this be sufficient concerning the first part of the 
        common Christian doctrine, both for teaching and urging 
        what is necessary. In conclusion, however, we must repeat 
        the text which belongs here, of which we have treated 
        already in the First Commandment, in order that we may 
        learn what pains God requires to the end we may learn to 
        inculcate and practise the Ten Commandments:</p> 
 
<p>     For I the Lord, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the 
        iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third 
        and fourth generation of them that hate Me, and showing 
        mercy unto thousands of them that love Me and keep My 
        commandments.</p> 
 
<p>     Although (as we have heard above) this appendix was 
        primarily attached to the First Commandment, it was 
        nevertheless [we cannot deny that it was] laid down for 
        the sake of all the commandments, as all of them are to 
        be referred and directed to it. Therefore I have said 
        that this, too, should be presented to and inculcated 
        upon the young, that they may learn and remember it, in 
        order to see what is to urge and compel us to keep these 
        Ten Commandments. And it is to be regarded as though this 
        part were specially added to each, so that it inheres in, 
        and pervades, them all.</p> 
 
<p>     Now, there is comprehended in these words (as said 
        before) both an angry word of threatening and a friendly 
        promise to terrify and warn us, and, moreover to induce 
        and encourage us to receive and highly esteem His Word as 
        a matter of divine earnestness, because He Himself 
        declares how much He is concerned about it, and how 
        rigidly He will enforce it, namely, that He will horribly 
        and terribly punish all who despise and transgress His 
        commandments; and again, how richly He will reward, 
        bless, and do all good to those who hold them in high 
        esteem, and gladly do and live according to them. Thus He 
        demands that all our works proceed from a heart which 
        fears and regards God alone, and from such fear avoids 
        everything that is contrary to His will, lest it should 
        move Him to wrath; and, on the other hand, also trusts in 
        Him alone, and from love to Him does all He wishes, 
        because he speaks to us as friendly as a father, and 
        offers us all grace and every good.</p> 
 
<p>     Just this is also the meaning and true interpretation of 
        the first and chief commandment, from which all the 
        others must flow and proceed, so that this word: Thou 
        shalt have no other gods before Me, in its simplest 
        meaning states nothing else than this demand: Thou shalt 
        fear, love, and trust in Me as thine only true God. For 
        where there is a heart thus disposed towards God, the 
        same has fulfilled this and all the other commandments. 
        On the other hand, whoever fears and loves anything else 
        in heaven and upon earth will keep neither this nor any. 
        Thus the entire scriptures have everywhere preached and 
        inculcated this commandment, aiming always at these two 
        things: fear of God and trust in Him. And especially the 
        prophet David throughout the Psalms, as when he says [Ps. 
        147,11]: The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him, 
        in those that hope in His mercy. As if the entire 
        commandment were explained by one verse, as much as to 
        say: The Lord taketh pleasure in those who have no other 
        gods.</p> 
 
<p>     Thus the First Commandment is to shine and impart its 
        splendor to all the others. Therefore you must let this 
        declaration run through all the commandments, like a hoop 
        in a wreath, joining the end to the beginning and holding 
        them all together, that it be continually repeated and 
        not forgotten; as, namely, in the Second Commandment, 
        that we fear God and do not take His name in vain for 
        cursing, lying, deceiving, and other modes of leading men 
        astray, or rascality, but make proper and good use of it 
        by calling upon Him in prayer, praise, and thanksgiving, 
        derived from love and trust according to the First 
        Commandment. In like manner such fear, love, and trust is 
        to urge and force us not to despise His Word, but gladly 
        to learn, hear, and esteem it holy, and honor it.</p> 
 
<p>     Thus continuing through all the following commandments 
        towards our neighbor likewise, everything is to proceed 
        by virtue of the First Commandment, to wit, that we honor 
        father and mother, masters, and all in authority and be 
        subject and obedient to them, not on their own account, 
        but for God's sake. For you are not to regard or fear 
        father or mother, or from love of them do or omit 
        anything. But see to that which God would have you do, 
        and what He will quite surely demand of you; if you omit 
        that, you have an angry Judge, but in the contrary case a 
        gracious Father.</p> 
 
<p>     Again, that you do your neighbor no harm, injury, or 
        violence, nor in any wise encroach upon him as touching 
        his body, wife, property, honor, or rights, as all these 
        things are commanded in their order, even though you have 
        opportunity and cause to do so and no man would reprove 
        you; but that you do good to all men, help them, and 
        promote their interest, howsoever and wherever you can, 
        purely from love of God and in order to please Him, in 
        the confidence that He will abundantly reward you for 
        everything. Thus you see how the First Commandment is the 
        chief source and fountainhead which flows into all the 
        rest, and again, all return to that and depend upon it, 
        so that beginning and end are fastened and bound to each 
        other.</p> 
 
<p>     This (I say) it is profitable and necessary always to 
        teach to the young people, to admonish them and to remind 
        them of it, that they may be brought up not only with 
        blows and compulsion, like cattle, but in the fear and 
        reverence of God. For where this is considered and laid 
        to heart that these things are not human trifles, but the 
        commandments of the Divine Majesty, who insists upon them 
        with such earnestness, is angry with, and punishes those 
        who despise them, and, on the other hand, abundantly 
        rewards those who keep them, there will be a spontaneous 
        impulse and a desire gladly to do the will of God. 
        Therefore it is not in vain that it is commanded in the 
        Old Testament to write the Ten Commandments on all walls 
        and corners, yes, even on the garments, not for the sake 
        of merely having them written in these places and making 
        a show of them, as did the Jews, but that we might have 
        our eyes constantly fixed upon them, and have them always 
        in our memory, and that we might practise them in all our 
        actions and ways, and every one make them his daily 
        exercise in all cases, in every business and transaction, 
        as though they were written in every place wherever he 
        would look, yea, wherever he walks or stands. Thus there 
        would be occasion enough, both at home in our own house 
        and abroad with our neighbors, to practise the Ten 
        Commandments, that no one need run far for them.</p> 
 
<p>     From this it again appears how highly these Ten 
        Commandments are to be exalted and extolled above all 
        estates, commandments, and works which are taught and 
        practised aside from them. For here we can boast and say: 
        Let all the wise and saints step forth and produce, if 
        they can, a [single] work like these commandments, upon 
        which God insists with such earnestness, and which He 
        enjoins with His greatest wrath and punishment, and, 
        besides, adds such glorious promises that He will pour 
        out upon us all good things and blessings. Therefore they 
        should be taught above all others, and be esteemed 
        precious and dear, as the highest treasure given by God.</p>
