<b><center>Proposals for Reform<br>
Part I</center></b>
 
<blockquote><blockquote>
 
<p> Now, although I am too small a man to make propositions which might effect a 
 reform in this dreadful state of things, nevertheless I may as well sing my 
 fool's song to the end, and say, so far as I am able, what could and should be 
 done by the temporal authorities or by a general council. </p>
 
<p>1. Every prince, nobleman and city should boldly forbid their subjects to pay 
 the annates to Rome and should abolish them entirely;[1] for the pope has 
 broken the compact and made the annates a robbery, to the injury and shame 
 of the whole German nation. He gives them to his friends, sells them for 
 large amounts of money, and uses them to endow offices. He has thus lost his 
 right to them, and deserves punishment. It is therefore the duty of the 
 temporal authorities to protect the innocent and prevent injustice, as Paul 
 teaches in Romans 13:4, and St. Peter in I Peter 2:14, and even the canon law 
 in Case 16, Question 7 <b>de filiis</b>.[2] Thus it has come about that men are 
 saying to the pope and his followers, T u or a, "Thou shalt pray"; to the 
 emperor and his followers, Tu protege, "Thou shalt guard"; to the common man, 
 <b>Tu labora</b>, "Thou shalt work." Not, however, as though everyone were not to 
 pray, guard and work; for the man who is diligent in his calling is praying, 
 guarding and working in all that he does, but everyone should have his own 
 especial task. </p>
 
<p>2. Since the pope with his Roman practices -- his commends,[3] <b>adjutories</b>;[4] 
 reservations,[5] <b>gratiae expectativae</b>,[6] papal months,[7] incorporations,[8] 
 unions,[9] pallia,[10] rules in chancery,[11] and such like knavery --  
 usurps all the German foundations without authority and right, and gives and 
 sells them to foreigners at Rome, who do nothing in German lands to earn them; 
 and since he thereby robs the ordinaries[12] of their rights, makes the 
 bishops mere ciphers and figure-heads, and acts against his own canon law, 
 against nature and against reason, until it has finally gone so far that out 
 of sheer avarice the livings and benefices are sold to gross, ignorant asses 
 and knaves at Rome, while pious and learned folk have no profit of their 
 wisdom and merit, so that the poor people of the German nation have to go 
 without good and learned prelates and thus go to ruin. </p>
 
<p>Therefore, the Christian nobility should set itself against the pope as 
 against a common enemy and destroyer of Christendom, and should do this for 
 the salvation of the poor souls who must go to ruin through his tyranny. They 
 should. ordain, order, and decree, that henceforth no benefice shall be drawn 
 into the hands of Rome, and that hereafter no appointment shall be obtained 
 there in any manner whatsoever, but that the benefices shall be brought out 
 and kept out from under this tyrannical authority; and they should restore to 
 the ordinaries the right and office of ordering these benefices in the German 
 nation as best they may. And if a "courtesan" were to come from Rome, he 
 should receive a strict command either to keep his distance, or else to jump 
 into the Rhine or the nearest river, and take the Roman ban, with its seals 
 and letters, to a cold bath. They would then take note at Rome that the 
 Germans are not always mad and drunken, but that they have really become 
 Christians, and intend to permit no longer the mockery and scorn of the holy 
 name of Christ, under which all this knavery and destruction of souls goes on, 
 but have more regard to God and His glory than to the authority of men. </p>
 
<p>3. An imperial law should be issued, that no bishop's cloak[13] and no 
 confirmation of any dignity[14] whatsoever shall henceforth be secured from 
 Rome, but that the ordinance of the most holy and most famous Council of 
 Nicaea[15] shall be restored, in which it is decreed that a bishop shall be 
 confirmed by the two nearest bishops or by the archbishop. If the pope will 
 break the statutes of this and of all other councils, what is the use of 
 hiding councils; or who has given him the authority thus to despise and break 
 the rules of councils? </p>
 
<p>If he has this power then we should depose all bishops, archbishops and 
 primates[16] and make them mere parish-priests, so that the pope alone may 
 be over them, as he now is. He leaves to bishops, archbishops and primates no 
 regular authority or office, usurps everything for himself, and lets them keep 
 only the name and empty title. It has gone so far that by his "exemptions"[17] 
 the monasteries, the abbots and the prelates are withdrawn from the 
 regular authority of the bishops, so that there is no longer any order in 
 Christendom. From this must follow what has followed -- relaxation of 
 discipline and license to do evil everywhere -- so that I verily fear the pope 
 can be called the "man of sin." There is in Christendom no discipline, no 
 rule, no order; and who is to blame except the pope? This usurped authority of 
 his he applies strictly to all the prelates, and takes away their rods; and he 
 is generous to all subjects, giving them or selling them their liberty. </p>
 
<p>Nevertheless, for fear he may complain that he is robbed of his authority, it 
 should be decreed that when the primates or archbishops are unable to settle a 
 case, or when a controversy arises among themselves, such a case must be laid 
 before the pope, but not every little matter.[19] Thus it was done in olden 
 times, and thus the famous Council of Nicaea decreed.[20] If a case can be 
 settled without the pope, then his Holiness should not be troubled with such 
 minor matters, but give himself to that prayer, meditation and care for all 
 Christendom, of which he boasts. This is what the Apostles did. They said, 
 Acts 6:2, "It is not meet that we should leave the Word of God and serve 
 tables, but we will keep to preaching and prayer and set others over the 
 work." But now Rome stands for nothing else than the despising of the Gospel 
 and of prayer, and for the serving of "tables," i.e., of temporal affairs, and 
 the rule of the Apostles and of the pope agree as Christ agrees with Lucifer, 
 heaven with hell, night with day; yet he is called "Vicar of Christ and 
 Successor of the Apostles." </p>
 
<p>4. It should be decreed that no temporal matter shall be taken to Rome,[21] 
 but that all such cases shall be left to the temporal authorities, as the 
 Romans themselves decree in that canon law of theirs, which they do not keep. 
 For it from the should be the duty of the pope, as the man most learned in the 
 Scriptures and most Holy, not in name only, but in truth, to administer 
 affairs which concern the faith and holy life of Christians, to hold the 
 primates and arch-bishops to these things, and to help them in dealing with 
 and caring for these matters. So St. Paul teaches in Corinthians 6:7, and 
 takes the Corinthians severely to task for their concern with worldly things. 
 For it works intolerable injury to all lands that such cases are tried at 
 Rome. It increases the costs, and moreover the judges do not know the manners, 
 laws and customs of the various countries, so that they often do violence to 
 the facts and base their decisions on their own laws and opinions, and thus 
 injustice is inevitably done the contestants. </p>
 
<p>Moreover, the outrageous extortion practiced by the officiales[22] must be 
 forbidden in all the dioceses, so that they may attend to nothing else than 
 matters of faith and good morals, and leave to the temporal judges the things 
 that concern money, property, life and honor. The temporal authorities, 
 therefore, should not permit sentences of ban or exile when faith or right 
 life is not concerned. Spiritual authorities should have rule over spiritual 
 goods, as reason teaches; but spiritual goods are not money, nor anything 
 pertaining to the body, but they are faith and good works. </p>
 
<p>Nevertheless it might be granted that cases which concern benefices or livings 
 should be tried before bishops, archbishops and primates. Therefore, in order 
 to decide contests and contentions, it might be possible for the Primate of 
 Germany to maintain a general consistory, with auditors and chancellors, which 
 should have control over the <b>signaturae gratiae</b> and <b>signaturae 
justitiae</b>,[23] 
 that are now controlled at Rome, and which should be the final court of appeal 
 for German cases. The officers of this consistory must not, however, be paid, 
 as at Rome, by chance presents and gifts, and thereby acquire the habit of 
 selling justice and injustice, which they now have to do at Rome because the 
 pope gives them no remuneration, but allows them to fatten themselves on 
 presents. For at Rome no one cares what is right or not right, but only what 
 is money or not money. This court might, however, be paid out of the annates, 
 or some other way might easily be devised, by those who are more intelligent 
 and who have more experience in these matters than I. All I wish to do is to 
 arouse and set to thinking those who have the ability and the inclination to 
 help the German nation become once more free and Christian, after the 
 wretched, heathenish and unchristian rule of the pope. </p>
 
<p>5. No more reservations should be valid, and no more benefices should be 
 seized by Rome, even if the incumbent dies, or there is a contest, or the 
 incumbent is a "servant" of a cardinal or of the pope;[24] and it should be 
 strictly forbidden and prevented that any "courtesan"[25] should institute a 
 contest over any benefice, so as to cite pious priests to Rome, harass them 
 and drive them into lawsuits. If, in consequence of this prohibition, there 
 should come from Rome a ban or an ecclesiastical censure, it should be 
 disregarded, just as though a thief were to lay a man under the ban because he 
 would not let him steal. Indeed they should be severely punished because they 
 so blasphemously misuse the ban and the name of God to support their robbery, 
 and with falsely devised threats would drive us to endure and to praise such 
 blasphemy of God's name arid such abuse of Christian authority, and thus to 
 become, in the sight of God, partakers in their rascality; it is our duty 
 before God to resist it, for St. Paul, in Romans 1:32, reproves as guilty of 
 death not only "those who do such things," but also those who consent to such 
 things and allow them to be done. Most unbearable of all is the lying 
 <b>reservatio pectoralis</b>,[26] whereby Christendom is so scandalously and openly 
 put to shame and scorn, because its head deals in open lies, and out of love 
 for the accursed money, shamelessly deceives and fools everybody. </p>
 
<p>6. The <b>casus reservati</b>,[27] the "reserved cases," should also be abolished, 
 for not only are they the means of extorting much money from the people, but 
 by means of them the ravening tyrants ensnare and confuse many poor 
 consciences to the intolerable injury of their faith in God. This is 
 especially true of the ridiculous and childish cases about which they make so 
 much ado in the <b>Bull Coena Domini</b>,[28] and which are not worth calling daily 
 sins, still less cases so grave that the pope may not remit them by any 
 indulgence; as for example, hindering a pilgrim on his way to Rome, furnishing 
 weapons to the Turks, or tampering with papal letters. With such gross, crazy, 
 clumsy things do they make fools of us! Sodom and Gomorrah, and all the sins 
 which are committed and can be committed against the commandments of God are 
 not reserved cases; but sins against what God has never commanded and what 
 they have themselves devised, these must be reserved cases, solely that no one 
 be hindered in bringing money to Rome, in order that, safe from the Turks, 
 they may live in luxury and keep the world under their tyranny with their 
 wanton, useless bulls and braves.[29] </p>
 
<p>All priests ought rightly to know, or else there should be a public ordinance 
 to that effect, that no secret sin, of which a man has not been publicly 
 accused, is a reserved case, and that every priest has the power to remit all 
 sorts of sins, however they may be called, so long as they are secret; 
 moreover that no abbot, bishop or pope has the power to reserve any such case 
 to himself.[30] If they attempt it, their reservation does not hold and is 
 not valid, and they should be reproved, as men who without authority interfere 
 in God's judgment, and without cause ensnare and burden poor, ignorant 
 consciences. But if great public sins are committed, especially sins against 
 God's commandments, then there is indeed a reason for reserved cases, but even 
 then there should not be too many of them, and they should not be reserved 
 arbitrarily and without cause; 1 Peter 5:3, for Christ has set in His Church 
 not tyrants, but shepherds, as saith St. Peter. </p>
 
<p>7. The Roman See should also do away with the <b>officia</b>, and diminish the swarm 
 of vermin at Rome, so that the pope's household can be supported by the pope's 
 own purse. The pope should not allow his court to surpass in pomp and 
 extravagance the courts of all kings, seeing that such a condition not only 
 has never been serviceable to the cause of Christian faith, but the courtiers 
 have been kept thereby from study and prayer, until they are scarce able to 
 speak about the faith at all. This they proved quite plainly at the last 
 Roman Council,[32] in which, amongst many other childish and frivolous 
 things, they decreed that the soul of man is immortal and that every priest 
 must say his prayers once a month on pain of losing his benefice. How shall 
 matters which concern faith and the Church be decided by people so hardened 
 and blinded by great avarice, wealth and worldly splendor, that they have only 
 now decreed that the soul is immortal? It is no small shame to all Christians 
 that at Rome they deal so disgracefully with the faith. If they had less 
 wealth and pomp, they could pray and study better, and so become worthy and 
 able to deal with matters of faith, as was the case in olden times when they 
 were bishops, and did not presume to be kings over all kings. </p>
 
<p>8. The hard and terrible oaths should be abolished, which the bishops are 
 wrongfully compelled to render to the pope,[33] and by which they are bound 
 like servants, as that worthless and unlearned chapter, <b>Significasti</b>,[34] 
 arbitrarily and most stupidly decrees. It is not enough that they burden us in 
 body, soul and property with their many mad laws, by which faith is weakened 
 and Christendom ruined; but they seize upon the person and office and work of 
 the bishops, and now upon the <b>investiture</b>[35] also, which was in olden times 
 the right of the German emperors, and in France and other kingdoms still 
 belongs to the kings. </p>
 
<p>On this point they had great wars and disputes with the emperors,[36] until 
 at last, with impudent authority, they took the right and have kept it until 
 now; just as though the Germans, above all the Christians on earth, had to be 
 the puppets of the pope and the Roman See and do and suffer what no one else 
 will do and suffer. Since, then, this is sheer violence and robbery, hindering 
 the regular authority of the bishops and injuring poor souls, therefore the 
 emperor and </p>
 
<p>9. The pope should have no authority over the emperor, except that he anoints 
 and crowns him at the altar, just as a bishop anoints and crowns a king;[37] 
 and we should not henceforth yield to that devilish pride which compels the 
 emperor to kiss the pope's feet or sit at his feet, or, as they claim, hold 
 his stirrup or the bridle of his mule when he mounts for a ride; still less 
 should he do homage and swear faithful allegiance to the pope, as the popes 
 have shamelessly ventured to demand as if they possessed that right. The 
 chapter "Solite,"[38] in which the papal authority is raised above the 
 imperial authority, is not worth a heller, nor are any of those who rest upon 
 it or fear it; for it does nothing else than force the holy words of God out 
 of their true meaning, and wrest them to human dreams, as I have showed in a 
 Latin treatise.[39] </p>
 
<p>Such extravagant, over-presumptuous, and more than wicked doings of the pope 
 have been devised by the devil, in order that under their cover he may in time 
 bring in Antichrist, and raise the pope above God, as many are ready doing and 
 have done. It is not proper for the pope to exalt himself above the temporal 
 authorities, save only in spiritual offices such as preaching and absolving. 
 In other things he is to be subject, as Paul and Peter teach, in Romans 13:1, 
 and 1 Peter 2:13, and as I have said above. His nobles are in duty bound to 
 prevent and punish such tyranny. He is not vicar of Christ in heaven, but of 
 Christ as He walked on earth.[41] For Christ in heaven, in the form of a 
 ruler, needs no vicar, but He sits and sees, does, and knows all things, and 
 has all power. But He needs a vicar in the form of a servant, in which He 
 walked on earth, toiling, preaching, suffering and dying. Now they turn it 
 around, take from Christ the heavenly form of ruler and give it to the pope, 
 leaving the form of a servant to perish utterly. He might almost be the 
 "Counter-Christ" whom the Scriptures call Antichrist, for all his nature, work 
 and doings are against Christ, for the destruction of Christ's nature and 
 work. </p>
 
<p>It is also ridiculous and childish that the pope, with such perverted and 
 deluded reasoning, boasts in his decretal <b>Pastoralis</b>,[42] that he is rightful 
 heir to the Empire, in case of a vacancy. Who has given him this right? Did 
 Christ, when He said, Luke 22:25, "The princes of the Gentiles are lords, but 
 ye shall not be so"? Did St. Peter will it to him? It vexes me that we must 
 read and learn such shameless, gross, crazy lies in the canon law, and must 
 even hold them for Christian doctrine, when they are devilish lies. </p>
 
<p>Of the same sort is also that unheard-of lie about the "Donation of 
 Constantine."[43] It must have been some special plague of God that so many 
 people of understanding have let themselves be talked into accepting such 
 likes as these, which are so manifest and clumsy that I should think any 
 drunken peasant could lie more adroitly and skillfully. How can a man rule an 
 empire and at the same time continue to preach, pray, study and care for the 
 poor? Yet these are the duties which properly and peculiarly belong to the 
 pope, and they were imposed by Christ (Matthew 10:10) in such earnest that He 
 even forbade His disciples to take with them cloak or money, since these 
 duties can scarcely be performed by one who has to rule even a single 
 household. Yet the pope would rule an empire and continue to be pope! This is 
 a device of the knaves who would like, under the pope's name, to be lords of 
 the world, and by means of the pope and the name of Christ, to restore the 
 Roman Empire to its former state. </p>
 
<p>10. The pope should restrain himself, take his fingers out of the pie, and 
 claim no title to the Kingdom of Naples and Sicily.[44] He has exactly as 
 much right to that kingdom as I have, and yet he wishes to be its overlord. It 
 is plunder got by violence, like almost all his other possessions. The 
 emperor, therefore, should not grant him this fief, and if it has been 
 granted, he should no longer give his consent to it, and should point him 
 instead to the Bible and the prayer-books, so that he may preach and pray, and 
 leave to temporal lords the ruling of lands and peoples, especially when no 
 one has given them to him. </p>
 
<p>The same opinion should hold as regards Bologna, Imola, Vicenza, Ravenna and 
 all the territories in the Mark of Ancona, in Romagna, and in other Italian 
 lands, which the pope has taken by force and possesses without right.[45] 
 Moreover, he has meddled in these things against all the commands of Christ 
 and of St. Paul. For thus saith St. Paul, 2 Timothy 2:3, "No one entangleth 
 himself with worldly affairs, whose business it is to wait upon the divine 
 knighthood".[46] Now the pope should be the head and front of this knighthood, 
 yet he meddles in worldly affairs more than any emperor or king. Why then he 
 must be helped out of them and allowed to attend to his knighthood. Christ 
 also, Whose vicar he boasts himself to be, was never willing to have aught to 
 do with temporal rule; indeed, to one who asked of him a decision respecting 
 his brother, He said, Luke 12:14, "Who made Me a judge over you?" But the pope 
 rushes in unbidden, and boldly takes hold of everything as though he were a 
 god, until he no longer knows what Christ is, Whose vicar he pretends to be. </p>
 
<p>11. The kissing of the pope's feet[47] should take place no more. It is an 
 unchristian, nay, an anti-Christian thing for a poor sinful man to let his 
 feet be kissed by one who is a hundred times better than himself. If it is 
 done in honor of his authority, why does not the pope do the same to others in 
 honor of their holiness? Compare the two -- Christ and the pope! John 13:1 ff., 
 Christ washed His disciples' feet and dried them, and the disciples never 
 washed His feet; the pope, as though he were higher than Christ, turns things 
 around and, as a great favor, allows people to kiss his feet, though he ought 
 properly to use all his power to prevent it, if anyone wished to do it; like 
 Paul and Barnabas, who would not let the people of Lystra pay them divine 
 honor, but said, Acts 14:11-16, "We are men like you." But our sycophants have 
 gone so far as to make for us an idol, and now no one fears God so much as he 
 fears the pope, no one pays Him such ceremonious honor. That they can endure! 
 What they cannot endure is that a hair's-breadth should be taken away from the 
 proud estate of the pope. Now if they were Christians, and held God's honor 
 above their own, the pope would never be happy while he knew that God's honor 
 was despised and his own exalted, and he would let no man pay him honor until 
 he saw that God's honor was again exalted and was greater than his own. </p>
 
<p>[48] It is another piece of the same scandalous pride, that the pope is not 
 satisfied to ride or to be driven in a vehicle, but although he is strong and 
 in good health, he has himself borne by men, with unheard-of splendor, like an 
 idol. How, pray, does such satanic pride agree with the example of Christ, Who 
 went on foot, as did all His disciples? Where has there ever been a worldly 
 monarch who went about in such worldly glory as he who wishes to be the head 
 of all those who are to despise and flee worldly glory, i.e., of Christians? 
 Not that this in itself should give us very much concern, but we should 
 rightly fear the wrath of God, if we flatter this kind of pride and do not 
 show our indignation. It is enough that the pope should rant and play the fool 
 in this wise; but that we should approve it and tolerate it, -- this too much. </p>
 
<p>For what Christian heart can or ought to take pleasure in seeing that when the 
 pope wishes to receive the communion, he sits quiet, like a gracious lord, and 
 has the sacrament passed to him on a golden rod by a bowing cardinal on bended 
 knee? As though the holy sacrament were no worthy that a pope, a poor stinking 
 sinner, should rise to show God honor, when all other Christians, who are much 
 more holy than the Most Holy Father, the pope, receive it with all reverence! 
 Would it be a wonder if God were to send a plague upon us all because we 
 suffer such dishonor to be done Him by our prelates, and approve it, and by 
 our silence or our flattery make ourselves partakers of such damnable pride? </p>
 
<p>It is the same way when he carries the sacrament in procession. He must be 
 carried, but the sacrament is set before him, like a can of wine on the table. 
 In short, at Rome Christ counts for nothing, the pope counts for everything; 
 and yet they would compel us with threats to approve, and praise and honor 
 such antichristian sins, though this is against God and against all Christian 
 doctrine. Now God help a free Council to teach the pope that he too is a man, 
 and is not more than God, as he presumes to be. </p>
 
<p>12. Pilgrimages to Rome[49] should either be abolished, or else no one should 
 be allowed to make such a pilgrimage out of curiosity or because of a pious 
 impulse, unless it is first recognized by his parish-priest, his town 
 authorities or his overlord, that he has good and sufficient reason for it. I 
 say this not because pilgrimages are bad, but because they are at this time 
 ill-advised. For men see at Rome no good example, but only that which offends; 
 and they have themselves made the proverb, "The nearer Rome, the worse 
 Christians."[50] Men bring back with them contempt for God and His 
 commandments. It is said: "The first time one goes to Rome he seeks a rascal, 
 the second time he finds him, the third time he brings him home with him."[51] 
 Now, however, they have become so clever that they make the three 
 journeys at once, and they have verily brought back from Rome such pretty 
 things that it were better never to have seen or known Rome. </p>
 
<p>Even if this reason did not exist, there is still another and a better: to 
 wit, that by these pilgrimages men are led away into a false conceit and a 
 misunderstanding of the divine commandments; for they think that this going on 
 pilgrimage is a precious, good work, and this is not true. It is a very small 
 good work, oftentimes an evil, delusive work, for God has not commanded it. 
 But He has commanded that a man shall care for his wife and children, and look 
 after such other duties as belong to the married state, and besides this, to 
 serve and help his neighbor. Now it comes to pass that a man makes a 
 pilgrimage to Rome when no one has commanded him to do so, spends fifty or a 
 hundred gulden, more or less, and leaves his wife and child, or at least his 
 neighbor, at home to suffer want. Yet the foolish fellow thinks to gloss over 
 such disobedience and contempt of the divine commandments with his self-willed 
 pilgriming, when it is really only curiosity or devilish delusion which leads 
 him to it. The popes have helped this along with their false, feigned, 
 foolish, "golden years,"[52] by which the people are excited, stirred up, 
 torn away from God's commandments, and drawn toward their own deluded 
 undertakings. Thus they have accomplished the very thing they should have 
 forbidden; but it has brought in money and strengthened false authority, 
 therefore it has had to continue, though it is against God and the salvation 
 of souls. </p>
 
<p>In order to destroy in simple Christians this false, seductive faith, and to 
 restore a true understanding of good works, all pilgrimages should be given 
 up; for there is in them nothing good -- no commandment, no obedience -- but, on 
 the contrary, numberless occasions for sin and for the despising of God's 
 commandments. Hence come the many beggars, who by this pilgriming carry on 
 endless knaveries and learn the habit of begging when they are not in want. 
 Hence, too, come vagabondage, and many other ills which I shall not now 
 recount. </p>
 
<p>If any one, now, wishes to go on pilgrimage or take a pilgrim's vow, he should 
 first show his reasons to his parish-priest or to his lord. If it turns out 
 that he wishes to do it for the sake of the good work, the priest or lord 
 should boldly tread the vow and good work under foot, as though it were a lure 
 of the devil, and show him how to apply the money and labor necessary for the 
 pilgrimage to the keeping of God's commandments and to works a thousandfold 
 better, viz., by spending it on his own family or on his poor neighbors. But 
 if he wishes to make the pilgrimage out of curiosity, to see new lands and 
 cities, he may be allowed to do as he likes. If, however, he has made the vow 
 while ill, then such vows ought to be forbidden and canceled, and the 
 commandments of God exalted, and he ought to be shown that he should 
 henceforth be satisfied with the vow he made in baptism,[53] to keep the 
 commandments of God. And yet, in order to quiet his conscience, he may be 
 allowed this once to perform his foolish vow. No one wants to walk in the 
 straight and common path of God's commandments; everyone makes himself new 
 roads and new vows, as though he had fulfilled all the commandments of God. </p>
 
<p>13. Next we come to that great crowd who vow much and keep little. Be not 
 angry, dear lords! Truly, I mean it well. It is the truth, and bitter-sweet, 
 and it is this, -- the building of mendicant-houses[54] should no more be 
 permitted. God help us, there are already far too many of them! Would to God 
 they were all done away, or at least given over to two or three orders! 
 Wandering about the land has never brought any good, and never l bring any 
 good. It is my advice, therefore, to put together ten of these houses, or as 
 many as may be necessary, and out of them all to make one house, which will be 
 well provided and need no more begging. It is much more important to consider 
 what the common people need for their salvation, than what St. Francis, 
 Dominic, St. Augustine[55] or any other man has decreed; especially since 
 things have not turned out as they expected. </p>
 
<p>The mendicants should also be relieved of preaching and hearing confession, 
 except when they are called to this work by the express desire of bishops, 
 parishes, congregations or the temporal authorities. Out of their preaching 
 and shriving there has come nothing but hatred and envy between priests and 
 monks, and great offense and hindrance to the common people. For this reason 
 it should properly and deservedly cease, because it can well be dispensed 
 with.[56] It looks suspiciously as though it were not for nothing that the 
 Holy Roman See has increased this army, so that the priests and bishops, tired 
 of its tyranny, might not some time become too strong for it and begin a 
 reformation which would not be to the liking of his Holiness. </p>
 
<p>At the same time the manifold divisions and differences within one and the 
 same order should be abolished. These divisions have at times arisen for small 
 reason and maintained themselves for still smaller, combating one another with 
 unspeakable hatred and envy.[57] Nevertheless the Christian faith, which can 
 well exist without any of these distinctions, is lost by both sides, and a 
 good Christian life is valued and sought after only in outward laws, works and 
 forms; and this results only in the devising of hypocrisy and the destruction 
 of souls, as everyone may see with his own eyes. </p>
 
<p>The pope must also be forbidden to found and confirm any more of these orders; 
 nay, he must be commanded to abolish some of them and reduce their number, 
 since the faith of Christ, which is alone the highest good and which exists 
 without any orders, is in no small danger, because these many different works 
 and forms easily mislead men into living for them instead of giving heed to 
 the faith. Unless there are in the monasteries wise prelates, who preach and 
 who concern themselves with faith more than with the rules of the orders, the 
 order cannot but harm and delude simple souls who think only of works. </p>
 
<p>In our days, however, the prelates who have had faith and who founded the 
 orders have almost all passed away. Just as in olden days among the children 
 of Israel, when the fathers, who knew God's works and wonders, had passed 
 away, the children, from ignorance of God's works and of faith, immediately 
 became idolatrous and set up their own human works; so now, alas! these orders 
 have lost the understanding of God's works and of faith, and only torture 
 themselves pitifully, with labor and sorrow, in their own rules, laws and 
 customs, and withal never come to a right understanding of a good spiritual 
 life, as the Apostle declared when he said in 2 Timothy 3:5, 7: "They have the 
 appearance of a spiritual life, yet there is nothing back of it; they are ever 
 and ever learning, but they never come to a knowledge of what a true spiritual 
 life is." There should be no monastery unless there were a spiritual prelate, 
 learned in the Christian faith, to rule it, for no other kind of prelate can 
 rule without injury and ruin, and the holier and better he appears to be in 
 his outward works and life, the more injury and ruin he causes. </p>
 
<p>To my way of thinking it would be a necessary measure, especially in these 
 perilous times of ours, that all foundations and monasteries should be 
 re-established as they were at the first, in the days of the Apostles and for 
 a long time afterwards, when they were all open to every man, and every man 
 might remain in them as long as he pleased. For what were the foundations and 
 monasteries except Christian schools in which the Scriptures and Christian 
 living were taught, and people were trained to rule and to preach? So we read 
 that St. Agnes[58] went to school, and we still see the same practice in some 
 of the nunneries, like that at Quedlinburg[59] and others elsewhere. And in 
 truth all monasteries and convents ought to be so free that God is served in 
 them with free will and not with forced avarice. Afterward, however, they 
 hedged them about with vows and turned them into a lifelong prison, so that 
 these vows are thought to be of more account than the vows of baptism. What 
 sort of fruit this has borne, we see, hear, read and learn more and more every 
 day. </p>
 
<p>I suppose this advice of mine will be regarded as the height of foolishness; 
 but I am not concerned about that just now. I advise what I think best; let him 
 reject it who will! I see how the vows are kept, especially the vow of 
 chastity, which has become so universal through these monasteries and yet is 
 not commanded by Christ; on the contrary, it is given to very few to keep it, 
 as He himself says, and St. Paul. (Matt. 19:11 ff., 1 Cor. 7:7, Col. 2:20) I 
 would have all men to be helped, and not have Christian souls caught in human, 
 self-devised customs and laws. </p>
 
<p>14. We also see how the priesthood has fallen, and how many a poor priest is 
 overburdened with wife and child, and his conscience troubled, yet no one does 
 anything to help him though he might easily be helped. Though pope and bishops 
 may let things go as they go, and let them go to ruin if they will, I will 
 save my conscience and open my month freely, whether it vex pope, bishops or 
 any one else. </p>
 
<p>Wherefore I say that according to the institution of Christ and the Apostles 
 every city should have a priest or bishop, as St. Paul clearly says in Titus 
 1:6; and this priest should not be compelled to live without a wedded wife, 
 but should be permitted to have one, as St. Paul says in I Timothy 3:2, and 
 Titus 1:6, "A bishop should be a man who is blameless, and the husband of but 
 one wedded wife, whose children are obedient and virtuous," etc. For with St. 
 Paul a bishop and a priest are one and the same thing, as witness also St. 
 Jerome.[60] But of bishops as they now are; the Scriptures know nothing; they 
 have been appointed by the ordinance of the Christian Church, that one of them 
 may rule over many priests. </p>
 
<p>So then we clearly learn from the Apostle that it should be the custom for 
 every town to choose out of the congregation[61] a learned and pious citizen, 
 entrust to him the office of the ministry, and support him at the expense of 
 the community, leaving him free choice to marry or not. He should have with 
 him several priests or deacons, who might also be married or not, as they 
 chose, to help him rule the people of the community[62] by means of preaching 
 and the sacraments, as is still the practice in the Greek Church. At a later 
 time,[63] when there were so many persecutions and controversies with 
 heretics, there were many holy fathers who of their own accord abstained from 
 matrimony, to the end that they might the better devote themselves to study 
 and be prepared at any time for death or for controversy. Then the Roman See 
 interfered, out of sheer wantonness, and made a universal commandment 
 forbidding priests to marry.[64] This was done at the bidding of the devil, 
 as St. Paul declares in I Timothy 4, "There shall come teachers who bring 
 doctrines of devils, and forbid to marry." From this has arisen so much untold 
 misery, occasion was given for the withdrawal of the Greek Church,[65] and 
 division, sin, shame and scandal were increased without end, - which is the 
 result of everything the devil does. </p>
 
<p>What, then, shall we do about it? My advice is that matrimony be again made 
 free,[66] and that every one be left free choice to marry or not to marry. In 
 that case, however, there must be a very different government and 
 administration of Church property, the whole canon law must go to pieces and 
 not many benefices find their way to Rome.[67] I fear that greed has been a 
 cause of this wretched unchaste chastity, and as a result of greed every man 
 has wished to become a priest and everyone wants his son to study for the 
 priesthood, not with the idea of living in chastity, for that could be done 
 outside the priesthood, but of being supported in temporal things without care 
 or labor, contrary to the command of God in Genesis 3:19, "In the sweat of thy 
 face shalt thou eat thy bread." They have construed this to mean that their 
 labor was to pray and say mass. </p>
 
<p>I am not referring here to popes, bishops, canons and monks. God has not 
 instituted these offices. They have taken burdens on themselves; let them bear 
 them. I would speak only of the ministry which God has instituted[68] and 
 which is to rule a congregation by means of preaching and sacraments, whose 
 incumbents are to live and be at home among the people. Such ministers should 
 be granted liberty by a Christian council to marry, for the avoidance of 
 temptation and sin. Gal. 1:8, For since God has not bound them, no one else 
 ought to bind them or can bind them, even though he were an angel from heaven, 
 still less if he be only a pope; and everything that the canon law decrees to 
 the contrary is mere fable and idle talk. </p>
 
<p>Furthermore, I advise that henceforth neither at his consecration to the 
 priesthood nor at any other time shall any one under any circumstances promise 
 the bishop to live in celibacy, but shall declare to the bishop that he has no 
 authority to demand such a vow, and that to demand it is the devil's own 
 tyranny. </p>
 
<p>But if anyone is compelled to say or wishes to say, as do some, "so far as 
 human frailty permits,"[69] let everyone frankly interpret these words 
 negatively, to mean "I do not promise chastity."[70] For human frailty does 
 not permit a chaste life,[71] but only angelic power and celestial might. 
 2 Pet. 2:11.[72] Thus he should keep his conscience free from all vows. </p>
 
<p>On the question whether those who are not yet married should marry or remain 
 unmarried, I do not care to give advice either way. I leave that to common 
 Christian order and to everyone's better judgment. But as regards the wretched 
 multitude who now sit in shame and heaviness of conscience because their wives 
 are called "priests' harlots" and their children "priests' children" I will 
 not withhold my faithful counsel nor deprive them of the comfort which is 
 their due, I say this boldly by my jester's right.[73] </p>
 
<p>You will find many a pious priest against whom no one has anything to say 
 except that he is weak and has come to shame with a woman, though both parties 
 may be minded with all their heart to live always together in wedded love and 
 troth, if only they could do it with a clear conscience, even though they 
 might have to bear public shame. Two such persons are certainly married before 
 God. And I say that where they are thus minded, and so come to live together, 
 they should boldly save their consciences; let him take and keep her as his 
 wedded wife, and live honestly with her as her husband, caring nothing whether 
 the pope will have it so or not, whether it be against canon law or human law. 
 The salvation of your soul is of more importance than tyrannical, arbitrary, 
 wicked laws, which are not necessary for salvation and are not commanded by 
 God. Ex. 12:35 f. You should do like the children of Israel, who stole from 
 the Egyptians the hire they had earned, or like a servant who steals from his 
 wicked master the wages he has earned. In like manner steal thou from the pope 
 thy wife and child! Let the man who has faith enough to venture this, boldly 
 follow me; I shall not lead him astray. Though I have not the authority of a 
 pope, I have the authority of a Christian to advise and help my neighbor 
 against sins and temptations; and that, not without cause and reason. </p>
 
<ul>
<p>First, not every priest can do without a woman, not only on account of the 
     weakness of the flesh, but much more because of the necessities of the 
     household. If he, then, may have a woman, and the pope grants him that, 
     and yet may not have her in marriage, -- what is that but leaving a man and 
     a woman alone and forbidding them to fall? It is as though one were to put 
     fire and straw together and command that it shall neither smoke nor burn. </p>
 
<p>Second, The pope has as little power to command this, as he has to forbid 
     eating, drinking, the natural movement of the bowels or growing fat. No 
     one, therefore, is bound to keep it, but the pope is responsible for all the 
     sins which are committed against this ordinance, for all the souls which 
     are lost thereby, for all the consciences which are thereby confused and 
     tortured; and therefore he has long deserved that some one should drive 
     him out of the world, so many wretched souls has he strangled with this 
     devil's snare; though I hope that there are many to whom God has been 
     more gracious at their last hour than the pope has been in their life. 
     Nothing good has ever come out of the papacy and its laws, nor ever will. </p>
 
<p>Third, Although the law of the pope is against it, nevertheless, when the 
     estate of matrimony has been entered against the pope's law, then his law 
     is at an end, and is no longer valid; for the commandment of God, which 
     decrees that no one shall put man and wife asunder, takes precedence of 
     the law of the pope; and the commandments of God must not be broken and 
     neglected for the sake of the pope's commandment, though many mad 
     jurists, in the papal interest, have devised "impediments"[74] and have 
     prevented, destroyed and confused the estate of matrimony, until by their 
     means God's commandment has been altogether destroyed. To make a long 
     story short, there are not in the whole "spiritual" law of the pope two 
     lines which could be instructive to a pious Christian, and there are, alas! 
     So many mistaken and dangerous laws that the best thing would be to 
     make a bonfire of it.[75]</p>
</ul>
 
<p>But if you say that this[76] would give offense, and the pope must first 
 grant dispensation, I reply that whatever offense is in it, is the fault of 
 the Roman See, which has established such laws without right and against God; 
 before God and the Scriptures it is no offense. Moreover, if the pope can 
 grant dispensations from his avaricious and tyrannical laws for money's sake, 
 then every Christian can grant dispensations from them -- for the sake of God 
 and the salvation of souls. For Christ has set us free from all human laws, 
 especially when they are opposed to God and the salvation of souls, as St. 
 Paul teaches in Galatians 5:1 and 1 Corinthians 9:4 ff.; 10:23.</p>

 of the Emperor Constantine (306-337). The Donation conveyed to the pope title 
 to the city of Rome (the capital had been removed to Constantinople), certain 
 lands in Italy and "the islands of the sea." It was used by the popes of the 
 Middle Ages to support their claims to worldly power, and its genuineness was 
 not disputed. In 1440, however, Laurentius Valla, an Italian humanist, 
 published a work in which he proved that the Donation was a forgery. This work 
 was republished in Germany by Ulrich von Hutten in 1517, and seems to have 
 come to Luther's attention in the early part of 1520, just before the 
 composition of the present treatise (Cf. ENDERS II, 332). Luther subsequently 
 (1537) issued an annotated translation of the text of the Donation (Erl. Ed., 
 XXV, pp. 176 ff.). </p>
 
<p>[44] The papal claim to temporal sovereignty over this little kingdom, which 
 comprised the island of Sicily and certain territories in Southern Italy, goes 
 back to the XI Century, and was steadily asserted during the whole of the 
 later Middle Ages. It was one of the questions at issue in the conflict 
 between the Emperor Frederick II (1200-1260) and the popes, and played an 
 important part in the history of the stormy times which followed the fall of 
 the Hobenstaufen. The popes claimed the right to award the kingdom to a ruler 
 who would swear allegiance to the Holy See. The right to the kingdom was at 
 this time contested between the royal houses of France and of Spain, of which 
 latter house the Emperor Charles V was the head. </p>
 
<p>[45] The popes claimed temporal sovereignty over a strip territory in Italy, 
 beginning at Rome and stretching in a northeasterly direction across the 
 peninsula to a point on the Adriatic south of Venice, including the cities and 
 lands which Luther mentions. This formed the so-called "States of the Church." 
 The attempt to consolidated the States and make the papal sovereignty 
 effective involved Popes Alexander VI (1492-1503) and Julius II (1503-1513) in 
 war and entangled them in political alliances with the European powers and 
 petty Italian states. It resulted at last in actual war between Pope Clement 
 VII and the Emperor Charles V (1526-1527). See <b>Cambridge Modern History</b>, I,

<p>[49] The holy places of Rome had long been favorite objects of pilgrimage, and 
 the practice had been zealously fostered by the popes through the institution 
 of the "golden" or "jubilee years." Cf. Vol. I, p. 18, and below, p. 114. </p>

<p>[52] The "golden" or "jubilee years" were the years when special rewards were 
 attached to worship at the shrines of Rome. The custom was instituted by 
 Boniface VIII in 1300, and it was the intention to make every hundredth year a 
 jubilee. In 1343 the interval between jubilees was fixed at fifty, in 1389 at 
 thirty-three, in 1473 at twenty-five years. Cf. Vol. I, p. 18. </p>

<p>[54] The houses, or monasteries, of the mendicant or "begging" orders -- the 
 "friars." The members of these orders were sworn to support themselves on the 
 alms of the faithful. </p>
 
<p>[55] The three leading mendicant orders were the Franciscan (the Minorities, 
 or "little brothers"), founded by St. Francis of Assisi (died 1226), the 
 Dominican (the "preaching brothers"), founded by St. Dominic (died 1221), and 
 the Augustinians Hermits, to which Luther himself belonged, and which claimed 
 foundation by St. Augustine (died 430). </p>
 
<p>[56] The interference of the friars in the duties of the parish clergy was a 
 continual subject of complaint through this period. </p>
 
<p>[57] By the middle of the XV Century there were eight distinct sects within 
 the Franciscan order alone (See Realencyk., Vi, pp. 212 ff.), and Luther had 
 himself taken part in a vigorous dispute between two parties in the 
 Augustinian order. </p>

 Celibacy</b>, 3d ed. (1907), I, pp. 59 ff. </p>
 
<p>[65] The priests of the Greek Church are required to marry, and the 
 controversy over celibacy was involved in the division between the Greek and 
 Roman Churches. </p>
 
<p>[66] Cf. Hutten's <b>Vadiscus</b> (BOCKING, IV, 199). </p>
 
<p>[67] i.e., Lie in Roman appointment. </p>
 
<p>[68] i.e., The ministry in the congregation. See above, p. 119. </p>
 
<p>[69] <b>Quantum fragilitas humana permittit.</b> A qualification of the vow. </p>
 
<p>[70] i.e., Celibacy. <b>Non promitto castitatem.</b> </p>
 
<p>[71] <b>Fragilitas humana non permittit caste vivere.</b> </p>
 
<p>[72] <b>Angelica fortitudo et coelestis virtus.</b> </p>
 
<p>[73] The court-jester was allowed unusual freedom of speech. See "Prefatory 
 Letter" above, p. 62. </p>
 
<p>[74] The laws governing marriage were entirely the laws of the Church. The 
 canon law prohibited marriage of blood-relatives as far as the seventh degree 
 of consanguinity. In 1204 the prohibition was restricted to the first four 
 degrees; lawful marriage within these degrees was possible only by 
 dispensation, which was not all too difficult to secure, especially by those 
 who were will willing to pay for it (see above, p. 96). The relation of 
 god-parents to god-children was also held to establish a "spiritual 
 consanguinity" which might serve as a bar to lawful marriage. See BENRATH, 
 p. 103, note 74, and in the Babylonian Captivity, below, p. 265. </p>
 
<p>[75] This Luther actually did. When he burned the papal bull of 
 excommunication (Dec. 10, 1520) a copy of the canon law was also given to the 
 flames. </p>
 
<p>[76] i.e., The marriage of the clergy.</p>
