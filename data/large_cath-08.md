<blockquote><blockquote> 

<p><b><a name="c8">The Eighth Commandment.</a></p>

<p>     Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.</b></p> 
  
<p>     Over and above our own body, spouse, and temporal 
        possessions, we have yet another treasure, namely, honor 
        and good report [the illustrious testimony of an upright 
        and unsullied name and reputation], with which we cannot 
        dispense. For it is intolerable to live among men in open 
        shame and general contempt. Therefore God wishes the 
        reputation, good name, and upright character of our 
        neighbor to be taken away or diminished as little as his 
        money and possessions, that every one may stand in his 
        integrity before wife, children, servants, and neighbors. 
        And in the first place, we take the plainest meaning of 
        this commandment according to the words (Thou shalt not 
        bear false witness), as pertaining to the public courts 
        of justice, where a poor innocent man is accused and 
        oppressed by false witnesses in order to be punished in 
        his body, property, or honor. 
  
<p>     Now, this appears as if it were of little concern to us 
        at present; but with the Jews it was quite a common and 
        ordinary matter. For the people were organized under an 
        excellent and regular government; and where there is 
        still such a government, instances of this sin will not 
        be wanting. The cause of it is that where judges, 
        burgomasters, princes, or others in authority sit in 
        judgment, things never fail to go according to the course 
        of the world; namely, men do not like to offend anybody, 
        flatter, and speak to gain favor, money, prospects, or 
        friendship; and in consequence a poor man and his cause 
        must be oppressed, denounced as wrong, and suffer 
        punishment. And it is a common calamity in the world that 
        in courts of justice there seldom preside godly men. 
  
<p>     For to be a judge requires above all things a godly man, 
        and not only a godly, but also a wise, modest, yea, a 
        brave and bold man; likewise, to be a witness requires a 
        fearless and especially a godly man. For a person who is 
        to judge all matters rightly and carry them through with 
        his decision will often offend good friends, relatives, 
        neighbors, and the rich and powerful, who can greatly 
        serve or injure him. Therefore he must be quite blind, 
        have his eyes and ears closed, neither see nor hear, but 
        go straight forward in everything that comes before him, 
        and decide accordingly. 
  
<p>     Therefore this commandment is given first of all that 
        every one shall help his neighbor to secure his rights, 
        and not allow them to be hindered or twisted, but shall 
        promote and strictly maintain them, no matter whether he 
        be judge or witness, and let it pertain to whatsoever it 
        will. And especially is a goal set up here for our 
        jurists that they be careful to deal truly and uprightly 
        with every case, allowing right to remain right, and, on 
        the other hand, not perverting anything [by their tricks 
        and technical points turning black into white and making 
        wrong out to be right], nor glossing it over or keeping 
        silent concerning it, irrespective of a person's money, 
        possession, honor, or power. This is one part and the 
        plainest sense of this commandment concerning all that 
        takes place in court. 
  
<p>     Next, it extends very much further, if we are to apply it 
        to spiritual jurisdiction or administration; here it is a 
        common occurrence that every one bears false witness 
        against his neighbor. For wherever there are godly 
        preachers and Christians, they must bear the sentence 
        before the world that they are called heretics, 
        apostates, yea, seditious and desperately wicked 
        miscreants. Besides the Word of God must suffer in the 
        most shameful and malicious manner, being persecuted 
        blasphemed, contradicted, perverted and falsely cited and 
        interpreted. But let this pass; for it is the way of the 
        blind world that she condemns and persecutes the truth 
        and the children of God, and yet esteems it no sin. 
  
<p>     In the third place, what concerns us all, this 
        commandment forbids all sins of the tongue whereby we may 
        injure or approach too closely to our neighbor. For to 
        bear false witness is nothing else than a work of the 
        tongue. Now, whatever is done with the tongue against a 
        fellow-man God would have prohibited, whether it be false 
        preachers with their doctrine and blasphemy, false judges 
        and witnesses with their verdict, or outside of court by 
        lying and evil-speaking. Here belongs particularly the 
        detestable, shameful vice of speaking behind a person's 
        back and slandering, to which the devil spurs us on and 
        of which there would be much to be said. For it is a 
        common evil plague that every one prefers hearing evil to 
        hearing good of his neighbor; and although we ourselves 
        are so bad that we cannot suffer that any one should say 
        anything bad about us, but every one would much rather 
        that all the world should speak of him in terms of gold, 
        yet we cannot bear that the best is spoken about others. 
  
<p>     Therefore, to avoid this vice we should note that no one 
        is allowed publicly to judge and reprove his neighbor, 
        although he may see him sin, unless he have a command to 
        judge and to reprove. For there is a great difference 
        between these two things, judging sin and knowing sin. 
        You may indeed know it, but you are not to judge it. I 
        can indeed see and hear that my neighbor sins, but I have 
        no command to report it to others. Now, if I rush in, 
        judging and passing sentence, I fall into a sin which is 
        greater than his. But if you know it, do nothing else 
        than turn your ears into a grave and cover it, until you 
        are appointed to be judge and to punish by virtue of your 
        office. 
  
<p>     Those, then, are called slanderers who are not content 
        with knowing a thing, but proceed to assume jurisdiction, 
        and when they know a slight offense of another, carry it 
        into every corner, and are delighted and tickled that 
        they can stir up another's displeasure [baseness], as 
        swine roll themselves in the dirt and root in it with the 
        snout. This is nothing else than meddling with the 
        judgment and office of God, and pronouncing sentence and 
        punishment with the most severe verdict. For no judge can 
        punish to a higher degree nor go farther than to say: "He 
        is a thief, a murderer, a traitor," etc. Therefore, 
        whoever presumes to say the same of his neighbor goes 
        just as far as the emperor and all governments. For 
        although you do not wield the sword, you employ your 
        poisonous tongue to the shame and hurt of your neighbor. 
  
<p>     God therefore would have it prohibited that any one speak 
        evil of another even though he be guilty, and the latter 
        know it right well; much less if he do not know it, and 
        have it only from hearsay. But you say: Shall I not say 
        it if it be the truth? Answer: Why do you not make 
        accusation to regular judges? Ah, I cannot prove it 
        publicly, and hence I might be silenced and turned away 
        in a harsh manner [incur the penalty of a false 
        accusation]. "Ah, indeed, do you smell the roast?" If you 
        do not trust yourself to stand before the proper 
        authorities and to make answer, then hold your tongue. 
        But if you know it, know it for yourself and not for 
        another. For if you tell it to others, although it be 
        true, you will appear as a liar, because you cannot prove 
        it, and you are, besides acting like a knave. For we 
        ought never to deprive any one of his honor or good name 
        unless it be first taken away from him publicly. 
  
<p>     False witness, then, is everything which cannot be 
        properly proved. Therefore, what is not manifest upon 
        sufficient evidence no one shall make public or declare 
        for truth; and in short, whatever is secret should be 
        allowed to remain secret, or, at any rate, should be 
        secretly reproved, as we shall hear. Therefore, if you 
        encounter an idle tongue which betrays and slanders some 
        one, contradict such a one promptly to his face, that he 
        may blush thus many a one will hold his tongue who else 
        would bring some poor man into bad repute from which he 
        would not easily extricate himself. For honor and a good 
        name are easily taken away, but not easily restored. 
  
<p>     Thus you see that it is summarily forbidden to speak any 
        evil of our neighbor, however the civil government, 
        preachers, father and mother excepted, on the 
        understanding that this commandment does not allow evil 
        to go unpunished. Now, as according to the Fifth 
        Commandment no one is to be injured in body, and yet 
        Master Hannes [the executioner] is excepted, who by 
        virtue of his office does his neighbor no good, but only 
        evil and harm, and nevertheless does not sin against 
        God's commandment, because God has on His own account 
        instituted that office; for He has reserved punishment 
        for His own good pleasure, as He threatens in the First 
        Commandment, -- just so also, although no one has a right 
        in his own person to judge and condemn anybody, yet if 
        they to whose office it belongs fail to do it, they sin 
        as well as he who would do so of his own accord, without 
        such office. For here necessity requires one to speak of 
        the evil, to prefer charges, to investigate and testify; 
        and it is not different from the case of a physician who 
        is sometimes compelled to examine and handle the patient 
        whom he is to cure in secret parts. Just so governments, 
        father and mother, brothers and sisters, and other good 
        friends, are under obligation to each other to reprove 
        evil wherever it is needful and profitable. 
  
<p>     But the true way in this matter would be to observe the 
        order according to the Gospel, Matt. 18, 15, where Christ 
        says: If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and 
        tell him his fault between thee and him alone. Here you 
        have a precious and excellent teaching for governing well 
        the tongue, which is to be carefully observed against 
        this detestable misuse. Let this, then, be your rule, 
        that you do not too readily spread evil concerning your 
        neighbor and slander him to others, but admonish him 
        privately that he may amend [his life]. Likewise, also, 
        if some one report to you what this or that one has done, 
        teach him, too, to go and admonish him personally if he 
        have seen it himself; but if not, that he hold his 
        tongue. 
  
<p>     The same you can learn also from the daily government of 
        the household. For when the master of the house sees that 
        the servant does not do what he ought, he admonishes him 
        personally. But if he were so foolish as to let the 
        servant sit at home, and went on the streets to complain 
        of him to his neighbors, he would no doubt be told: "You 
        fool, what does that concern us? Why do you not tell it 
        to him ?" Behold, that would be acting quite brotherly, 
        so that the evil would be stayed, and your neighbor would 
        retain his honor. As Christ also says in the same place: 
        If he hear thee, thou host gained thy brother. Then you 
        have done a great and excellent work; for do you think it 
        is a little matter to gain a brother? Let all monks and 
        holy orders step forth, with all their works melted 
        together into one mass, and see if they can boast that 
        they have gained a brother. 
  
<p>     Further, Christ teaches: But if he will not hear thee, 
        then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of 
        two or three witnesses every word may be established. So 
        he whom it concerns is always to be treated with 
        personally, and not to be spoken of without his 
        knowledge. But if that do not avail, then bring it 
        publicly before the community, whether before the civil 
        or the ecclesiastical tribunal. For then you do not stand 
        alone, but you have those witnesses with you by whom you 
        can convict the guilty one, relying on whom the judge can 
        pronounce sentence and punish. This is the right and 
        regular course for checking and reforming a wicked 
        person. But if we gossip about another in all corners and 
        stir the filth, no one will be reformed, and afterwards 
        when we are to stand up and bear witness, we deny having 
        said so. Therefore it would serve such tongues right if 
        their itch for slander were severely punished, as a 
        warning to others. If you were acting for your neighbor's 
        reformation or from love of the truth, you would not 
        sneak about secretly nor shun the day and the light. 
  
<p>     All this has been said regarding secret sins. But where 
        the sin is quite public so that the judge and everybody 
        know it you can without any sin avoid him and let him go, 
        because he has brought himself into disgrace, and you may 
        also publicly testify concerning him. For when a matter 
        is public in the light of day, there can be no slandering 
        or false judging or testifying; as, when we now reprove 
        the Pope with his doctrine, which is publicly set forth 
        in books and proclaimed in all the world. For where the 
        sin is public, the reproof also must be public, that 
        every one may learn to guard against it. 
  
<p>     Thus we have now the sum and general understanding of 
        this commandment, to wit, that no one do any injury with 
        the tongue to his neighbor, whether friend or foe, nor 
        speak evil of him, no matter whether it be true or false, 
        unless it be done by commandment or for his reformation, 
        but that every one employ his tongue and make it serve 
        for the best of every one else, to cover up his 
        neighbor's sins and infirmities, excuse them, palliate 
        and garnish them with his own reputation. The chief 
        reason for this should be the one which Christ alleges in 
        the Gospel, in which He comprehends all commandments 
        respecting our neighbor, Matt. 7, 12: Whatsoever ye would 
        that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. 
  
<p>     Even nature teaches the same thing in our own bodies, as 
        St. Paul says, 1 Cor. 12, 22: Much more, those members of 
        the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary; and 
        those members of the body which we think to be less 
        honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and 
        our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. No one 
        covers his face, eyes, nose, and mouth, for they, being 
        in themselves the most honorable members which we have, 
        do not require it. But the most infirm members, of which 
        we are ashamed, we cover with all diligence; hands, eyes, 
        and the whole body must help to cover and conceal them. 
        Thus also among ourselves should we adorn whatever 
        blemishes and infirmities we find in our neighbor, and 
        serve and help him to promote his honor to the best of 
        our ability, and, on the other hand, prevent whatever may 
        be discreditable to him. And it is especially an 
        excellent and noble virtue for one always to explain 
        advantageously and put the best construction upon all he 
        may hear of his neighbor (if it be not notoriously evil), 
        or at any rate to condone it over and against the 
        poisonous tongues that are busy wherever they can pry out 
        and discover something to blame in a neighbor, and that 
        explain and pervert it in the worst way; as is done now 
        especially with the precious Word of God and its 
        preachers. 
  
<p>     There are comprehended therefore in this commandment 
        quite a multitude of good works which please God most 
        highly, and bring abundant good and blessing, if only the 
        blind world and the false saints would recognize them. 
        For there is nothing on or in entire man which can do 
        both greater and more extensive good or harm in spiritual 
        and in temporal matters than the tongue, though it is the 
        least and feeblest member. 

<p><b><a name="c910">The Ninth and Tenth Commandments</a></p> 
  
<p>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house. Thou shalt not 
        covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his 
        maid-servant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is his.</b></p 
  
<p>     These two commandments are given quite exclusively to the 
        Jews; nevertheless, in part they also concern us. For 
        they do not interpret them as referring to unchastity or 
        theft, because these are sufficiently forbidden above. 
        They also thought that they had kept all those when they 
        had done or not done the external act. Therefore God has 
        added these two commandments in order that it be esteemed 
        as sin and forbidden to desire or in any way to aim at 
        getting our neighbor's wife or possessions; and 
        especially because under the Jewish government 
        man-servants and maid-servants were not free as now to 
        serve for wages as long as they pleased, but were their 
        master's property with their body and all they had, as 
        cattle and other possessions. Moreover, every man had 
        power over his wife to put her away publicly by giving 
        her a bill of divorce, and to take another. Therefore 
        they were in constant danger among each other that if one 
        took a fancy to another's wife, he might allege any 
        reason both to dismiss his own wife and to estrange the 
        other's wife from him, that he might obtain her under 
        pretext of right. That was not considered a sin nor 
        disgrace with them; as little as now with hired help, 
        when a proprietor dismisses his man-servant or 
        maid-servant, or takes another's servants from him in any 
        way. 
  
<p>     Therefore (I say) they thus interpreted these 
        commandments, and that rightly (although their scope 
        reaches somewhat farther and higher), that no one think 
        or purpose to obtain what belongs to another, such as his 
        wife, servants, house and estate, land meadows, cattle, 
        even with a show of right or by a subterfuge, yet with 
        injury to his neighbor. For above, in the Seventh 
        Commandment, the vice is forbidden where one wrests to 
        himself the possessions of others, or withholds them from 
        his neighbor, which he cannot do by right. But here it is 
        also forbidden to alienate anything from your neighbor, 
        even though you could do so with honor in the eyes of the 
        world, so that no one could accuse or blame you as though 
        you had obtained it wrongfully. 
  
<p>     For we are so inclined by nature that no one desires to 
        see another have as much as himself, and each one 
        acquires as much as he can; the other may fare as best he 
        can. And yet we pretend to be godly, know how to adorn 
        ourselves most finely and conceal our rascality, resort 
        to and invent adroit devices and deceitful artifices 
        (such as now are daily most ingeniously contrived) as 
        though they were derived from the law codes; yea, we even 
        dare impertinently to refer to it, and boast of it, and 
        will not have it called rascality, but shrewdness and 
        caution. In this lawyers and jurists assist, who twist 
        and stretch the law to suit it to their cause, stress 
        words and use them for a subterfuge, irrespective of 
        equity or their neighbor's necessity. And, in short, 
        whoever is the most expert and cunning in these affairs 
        finds most help in law, as they themselves say: 
        Vigilantibus iura subveniunt [that is, The laws favor the 
        watchful]. 
  
<p>     This last commandment therefore is given not for rogues 
        in the eyes of the world, but just for the most pious, 
        who wish to be praised and be called honest and upright 
        people, since they have not offended against the former 
        commandments, as especially the Jews claimed to be, and 
        even now many great noblemen, gentlemen, and princes. For 
        the other common masses belong yet farther down, under 
        the Seventh Commandment, as those who are not much 
        concerned whether they acquire their possessions with 
        honor and right. 
  
<p>     Now, this occurs most frequently in cases that are 
        brought into court, where it is the purpose to get 
        something from our neighbor and to force him out of his 
        own. As (to give examples), when people quarrel and 
        wrangle about a large inheritance, real estate, etc., 
        they avail themselves of, and resort to, whatever has the 
        appearance of right, so dressing and adorning everything 
        that the law must favor their side, and they keep the 
        property with such title that no one can make complaint 
        or lay claim thereto. In like manner, if any one desire 
        to have a castle, city, duchy, or any other great thing, 
        he practises so much financiering through relationships, 
        and by any means he can, that the other is judicially 
        deprived of it, and it is adjudicated to him, and 
        confirmed with deed and seal and declared to have been 
        acquired by princely title and honestly. 
  
<p>     Likewise also in common trade where one dexterously slips 
        something out of another's hand, so that he must look 
        after it, or surprises and defrauds him in a matter in 
        which he sees advantage and benefit for himself, so that 
        the latter, perhaps on account of distress or debt, 
        cannot regain or redeem it without injury, and the former 
        gains the half or even more; and yet this must not be 
        considered as acquired by fraud or stolen, but honestly 
        bought. Here they say: First come, first served, and 
        every one must look to his own interest, let another get 
        what he can. And who can be so smart as to think of all 
        the ways in which one can get many things into his 
        possession by such specious pretexts? This the world does 
        not consider wrong [nor is it punished by laws], and will 
        not see that the neighbor is thereby placed at a 
        disadvantage, and must sacrifice what he cannot spare 
        without injury. Yet there is no one who wishes this to be 
        done to him; from which we can easily perceive that such 
        devices and pretexts are false. 
  
<p>     Thus it was done formerly also with respect to wives: 
        they knew such devices that if one were pleased with 
        another woman, he personally or through others (as there 
        were many ways and means to be invented) caused her 
        husband to conceive a displeasure toward her, or had her 
        resist him and so conduct herself that he was obliged to 
        dismiss her and leave her to the other. That sort of 
        thing undoubtedly prevailed much under the Law, as also 
        we read in the (Gospel of King Herod that he took his 
        brother's wife while he was yet living, and yet wished to 
        be thought an honorable, pious man, as St. Mark also 
        testifies of him. But such an example, I trust, will not 
        occur among us, because in the New Testament those who 
        are married are forbidden to be divorced, except in such 
        a case where one [shrewdly] by some stratagem takes away 
        a rich bride from another. But it is not a rare thing 
        with us that one estranges or alienates another's 
        man-servant or maid-servant, or entices them away by 
        flattering words. 
  
<p>     In whatever way such things happen, we must know that God 
        does not wish that you deprive your neighbor of anything 
        that belongs to him so that he suffer the loss and you 
        gratify your avarice with it, even if you could keep it 
        honorably before the world; for it is a secret and 
        insidious imposition practised under the hat, as we say, 
        that it may not be observed. For although you go your way 
        as if you had done no one any wrong, you have 
        nevertheless injured your neighbor; and if it is not 
        called stealing and cheating, yet it is called coveting 
        your neighbor's property, that is, aiming at possession 
        of it, enticing it away from him without his will, and 
        being unwilling to see him enjoy what God has granted 
        him. And although the judge and every one must leave you 
        in possession of it, yet God will not leave you therein; 
        for He sees the deceitful heart and the malice of the 
        world, which is sure to take an ell in addition wherever 
        you yield to her a finger's breadth, and at length public 
        wrong and violence follow. 
  
<p>     Therefore we allow these commandments to remain in their 
        ordinary meaning, that it is commanded, first, that we do 
        not desire our neighbor's damage, nor even assist, nor 
        give occasion for it, but gladly wish and leave him what 
        he has, and, besides, advance and preserve for him what 
        may be for his profit and service, as we should wish to 
        be treated. Thus these commandments are especially 
        directed against envy and miserable avarice, God wishing 
        to remove all causes and sources whence arises everything 
        by which we do injury to our neighbor, and therefore He 
        expresses it in plain words: Thou shalt not covet, etc. 
        For He would especially have the heart pure, although we 
        shall never attain to that as long as we live here; so 
        that this commandment will remain, like all the rest, one 
        that will constantly accuse us and show how godly we are 
        in the sight of God!</p>
