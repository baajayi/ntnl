<blockquote><blockquote> 
<p><b>I.    The Ten Commandments: The Simple Way a Father Should Present 
             Them to His Household</b></p> 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="a">A.    The First Commandment</a></p> 
 
       <ul><p>You must not have other gods.</b></p> 
 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
 
       <p><b>A.</b> We must fear, love, and trust God more than anything else.</p> 
</ul></ul> 
 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="b">B.    The Second Commandment</a></p> 
       <ul><p>You must not misuse your God's name.</b></p> 
 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
 
       <p><b>A.</b> We must fear and love God, so that we will not use His name 
       to curse, swear, cast a spell, lie or deceive, but will use it to 
       call upon Him, pray to Him, praise Him and thank Him in all times 
       of trouble.</p></ul></ul> 
 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="c">C.    The Third Commandment</a></p> 
 
       <ul><p>You must keep the Sabbath holy.</b></p> 
 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
 
       <p><b>A.</b> We must fear and love God, so that we will not look down on 
       preaching or God's Word, but consider it holy, listen to it 
       willingly, and learn it.</p></ul></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="d">D.    The Fourth Commandment</a></p> 
 
       <ul><p>You must honor your father and mother. [So that things will go 
       well for you and you will live long on earth].</b></p> 
 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
 
       <p><b>A.</b> We must fear and love God, so that we will neither look down 
       on our parents or superiors nor irritate them, but will honor 
       them, serve them, obey them, love them and value them.</p></ul></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="e">E.    The Fifth Commandment</a></p> 
 
       <ul><p>You must not kill.</b></p> 
 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
 
       <p><b>A.</b> We must fear and love God, so that we will neither harm nor 
       hurt our neighbor's body, but help him and care for him when he is 
       ill.</p></ul></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="f">F.    The Sixth Commandment</a></p> 
 
       <ul><p>You must not commit adultery.</b></p> 
 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
 
       <p><b>A.</b> We must fear and love God, so that our words and actions 
       will be clean and decent and so that everyone will love and honor 
       their spouses.</p></ul></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="g">G.    The Seventh Commandment</a></p> 
 
       <ul><p>You must not steal.</b></p> 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
 
       <p><b>A.</b> We must fear and love God, so that we will neither take our 
       neighbor's money or property, nor acquire it by fraud or by 
       selling him poorly made products, but will help him improve and 
       protect his property and career.</p></ul></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="h">H.    The Eighth Commandment</a></p> 
 
       <ul><p>You must not tell lies about your neighbor.</b></p> 
 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
 
       <p><b>A.</b> We must fear and love God, so that we will not deceive by 
       lying, betraying, slandering or ruining our neighbor's reputation, 
       but will defend him, say good things about him, and see the best 
       side of everything he does.</p></ul></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="i">I.    The Ninth Commandment</a></p> 
 
       <ul><p>You must not desire your neighbor's house.</b></p> 
 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
 
       <p><b>A.</b> We must fear and love God, so that we will not attempt to 
       trick our neighbor out of his inheritance or house, take it by 
       pretending to have a right to it, etc. but help him to keep & 
       improve it.</p></ul></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="j">J.    The Tenth Commandment</a></p> 
 
       <ul><p>You must not desire your neighbor's wife, servant, maid, animals 
       or anything that belongs to him.</b></p> 
 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does this mean?</p> 
 
       <p><b>A.</b> We must fear and love God, so that we will not release his 
       cattle, take his employees from him or seduce his wife, but urge 
       them to stay and do what they ought to do.</b></p></ul></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b><a name="end">K.    The Conclusion to the Commandments</b></a> 
 
       <ul> 
       <p><b>Q.</b> What does God say to us about all these commandments?</p> 
 
       <p><b>A.</b> This is what He says:</p></ul> 
 
       <p><i>"I am the Lord Your God. I am a jealous God. I plague the 
       grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those who hate me with 
       their ancestor's sin. But I make whole those who love me for a 
       thousand generations."</i></p> 
 
       <ul><p><b>Q.</b> What does it mean?</p> 
       <p><b>A.</b> God threatens to punish everyone who breaks these commandments. 
       We should be afraid of His anger because of this and not violate 
       such commandments. But He promises grace and all good things to 
       those who keep such commandments. Because of this, we, too, should 
       love Him, trust Him, and willingly do what His commandments 
       require.</b></ul>
