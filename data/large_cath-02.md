<br>II. 
<br><a name="pref">Short Preface by Dr. Martin Luther</a> 
<br>__________</center></b> 
 
<blockquote><blockquote> 
<p>     This sermon is designed and undertaken that it might be an 
        instruction for children and the simple-minded. Hence of old 
        it was called in Greek catechism, i.e., instruction for 
        children, what every Christian must needs know, so that he who 
        does not know this could not be numbered with the Christians 
        nor be admitted to any Sacrament, just as a mechanic who does 
        not understand the rules and customs of his trade is expelled 
        and considered incapable. Therefore we must have the young 
        learn the parts which belong to the Catechism or instruction 
        for children well and fluently and diligently exercise 
        themselves in them and keep them occupied with them.</p> 
 
<p>     Therefore it is the duty of every father of a family to 
        question and examine his children and servants at least once a 
        week and to ascertain what they know of it, or are learning 
        and, if they do not know it, to keep them faithfully at it. 
        For I well remember the time, indeed, even now it is a daily 
        occurrence that one finds rude, old persons who knew nothing 
        and still know nothing of these things, and who, nevertheless, 
        go to Baptism and the Lord's Supper, and use everything 
        belonging to Christians, notwithstanding that those who come 
        to the Lord's Supper ought to know more and have a fuller 
        understanding of all Christian doctrine than children and new 
        scholars. However, for the common people we are satisfied with 
        the three parts, which have remained in Christendom from of 
        old, though little of it has been taught and treated correctly 
        until both young and old who are called and wish to be 
        Christians, are well trained in them and familiar with them. 
        These are the following:</p> 
 
<ul><p><b>First.</b></p> 
 
<p><b><a name="cmndts">THE TEN COMMANDMENTS OF GOD.</a></b></p> 
 
<ul> 
<p><a href="cat-03.html#c1">1.</a> 
 Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. </p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-04.html#c2">2.</a> 
 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord, thy God, in vain 
        [for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name 
        in vain].</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-05.html#c3">3.</a> 
 Thou shalt sanctify the holy-day. [Remember the Sabbath-day 
        to keep it holy.]</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-06.html#c4">4.</a> 
 Thou shalt honor thy father and mother [that thou mayest 
        live long upon the earth].</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-07.html#c5">5.</a> 
 Thou shalt not kill.</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-07.html#c6">6.</a> 
 Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-07.html#c7">7.</a> 
 Thou shalt not steal.</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-08.html#c8">8.</a> 
 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. </p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-08.html#c910">9.</a> 
 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-08.html#c910">10.</a> 
 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his 
        man-servant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle [ox, nor his 
        ass], nor anything that is his.</p> 
</ul></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b>Secondly.</b></p> 
 
<p><b>  THE CHIEF ARTICLES OF OUR FAITH.</b> 
 
<ul> 
<p><a href="cat-10.html#cr1">1.</a> 
 I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and 
        earth.</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-10.html#cr2">2.</a> 
 And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; who was 
        conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered 
        under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried; He 
        descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the 
        dead; He ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand 
        of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge 
        the quick and the dead.</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-10.html#cr3">3.</a> 
 I believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy Christian Church, the 
        communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection 
        of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.</p> 
</ul></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b>Thirdly.</b></p> 
 
<p><b><a href="cat-11.html#lords">THE PRAYER</a>, OR "OUR FATHER," 
WHICH CHRIST TAUGHT</b></p> 
 
<ul><p><b>Our Father who art in heaven.</b></p> 
 
<ul> 
<p><a href="cat-12.html#tlp1">1.</a> 
 Hallowed be Thy name.</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-12.html#tlp2">2.</a> 
 Thy kingdom come.</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-12.html#tlp3">3.</a> 
 Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-12.html#tlp4">4.</a> 
 Give us this day our daily bread.</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-12.html#tlp5">5.</a> 
 And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who 
        trespass against us.</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-12.html#tlp6">6.</a> 
 And lead us not into temptation.</p> 
 
<p><a href="cat-12.html#tlp7">7.</a> 
 But deliver us from evil. [For Thine is the kingdom and the 
        power and the glory, forever and ever.] Amen.</p> 
</ul></ul></ul> 
 
<p>     These are the most necessary parts which one should first 
        learn to repeat word for word and which our children should be 
        accustomed to recite daily when they arise in the morning when 
        they sit down to their meals, and when they retire at night; 
        and until they repeat them, they should be given neither food 
        nor drink. Likewise every head of a household is obliged to do 
        the same with respect to his domestics, man-servants and 
        maid-servants and not to keep them in his house if they do not 
        know these things and are unwilling to learn them. For a 
        person who is so rude and unruly as to be unwilling to learn 
        these things is not to be tolerated, for in these three parts 
        everything that we have in the Scriptures is comprehended in 
        short, pain, and simple terms. For the holy Fathers or 
        apostles (whoever they were) have thus embraced in a summary 
        the doctrine, life, wisdom, and art of Christians, of which 
        they speak and treat, and with which they are occupied.</p> 
 
<p>     Now, when these three arts are apprehended, it behooves a 
        person also to know what to say concerning our Sacraments, 
        which Christ Himself instituted, Baptism and the holy body and 
        blood of Christ, namely, the text which Matthew [28, 19 ff.] 
        and Mark [16, 15 f.] record at the close of their Gospels when 
        Christ said farewell to His disciples and sent them forth. </p> 
 
<ul><p><b><a href="cat-13.html#baptism">OF BAPTISM.</a></b></p> 
<p>     Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the 
        Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. He that 
        believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that 
        believeth not shall be damned.</p> 
 
<p>     So much is sufficient for a simple person to know from the 
        Scriptures concerning Baptism. In like manner, also, 
        concerning the other Sacrament in short, simple words, namely 
        the text of St. Paul [1 Cor. 11, 23 f.].</p></ul> 
 
<ul><p><b><a href="cat-14.html#scmt">OF THE SACRAMENT</a></b></p> 
 
<p>     Our Lord Jesus Christ, the same night in which He was 
        betrayed, took bread; and when He had given thanks, He brake 
        it, and gave it to His disciples and said, Take, eat; this is 
        My body, which is given for you: this do in remembrance of Me.</p> 
 
<p>     After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had 
        supped, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all 
        of it; this cup is the new testament in My blood, which is 
        shed for you for the remission of sins: this do ye, as oft as 
        ye drink it, in remembrance of Me.</p> 
 
<p>     Thus, ye would have, in all, five parts of the entire 
        Christian doctrine which should be constantly treated and 
        required [of children] and heard recited word for word. For 
        you must not rely upon it that the young people will learn and 
        retain these things from the sermon alone. When these parts 
        have been well learned, you may, as a supplement and to 
        fortify them. lay before them also some psalms or hymns, which 
        have been composed on these parts, and thus lead the young 
        into the Scriptures, and make daily progress therein. </p> 
 
<p>     However, it is not enough for them to comprehend and recite 
        these parts according to the words only, but the young people 
        should also be made to attend the preaching, especially during 
        the time which is devoted to the Catechism, that they may hear 
        it explained and may learn to understand what every part 
        contains, so as to be able to recite it as they have heard it, 
        and, when asked, may give a correct answer, so that the 
        preaching may not be without profit and fruit. For the reason 
        why we exercise such diligence in preaching the Catechis so 
        often is that it may be inculcated on our youth, not in a high 
        and subtile manner, but briefly and with the greatest 
        simplicity, so as to enter the mind readily and be fixed in 
        the memory.</p> 
 
<p>     Therefore we shall now take up the abovementioned articles one 
        by one and in the plainest manner possible say about them as 
        much as is necessary.</p></ul>
